Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Amendments to Stock Incentive Plans
On May 2, 2006, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.s (FCX) Board of Directors adopted technical amendments to several of FCXs stock incentive plans, including the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, and 1995 Stock Option Plan. The amendments (1) remove FCXs ability to allow participants to satisfy excess tax withholding by delivering shares of common stock and (2) clarify that shares of common stock delivered to pay the exercise price of stock options will be valued as of the date of exercise under all of its stock incentive plans. Each of the amended plans is filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K (see Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3).
Amendments to Grants under 2004 Director Compensation Plan
On May 9, 2004, pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Director Compensation Plan and with the approval of our stockholders, FCX granted stock options and stock appreciation rights to its two former advisory directors to replace awards that had expired as a result of the directors resignations from the Board. These replacement awards had the same terms as the expired awards, including the exercise price. In order to make the replacement awards fully exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, on May 2, 2006, the Corporate Personnel Committee of the Board approved amendments to certain portions of the replacement awards to increase the exercise price to the fair market value of FCX common stock on the date of grant. The form of amendment to the Notice of Grant of Nonqualified Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights is filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K (see Exhibit 10.4).
Amendments to Financial Counseling and Tax Return Preparation and Certification Program
On May 2, 2006, the Corporate Personnel Committee of the Board amended the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. Financial Counseling and Tax Return Preparation and Certification Program (Program) to (1) change the name of the Program to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. Executive Services Program, (2) broaden the scope of services provided under the Program and (3) clarify other sections of the Program. The Program is filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K (see Exhibit 10.5).
2006 Stock Incentive Plan
On May 4, 2006, FCX stockholders approved the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to motivate and reward key personnel with stock based-awards at an appropriate level. Currently, there are approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock available for grant under FCXs stock incentive plans. Accordingly, FCXs Board believed it was important that FCX establish a new equity-based compensation plan at this time.
Awards under the Plan will be made by the Corporate Personnel Committee of the Board, which has full power and authority to designate participants, to set the terms of awards and to make any determinations necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan.
The types of awards that may be granted under the Plan include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. The maximum number of shares of FCX common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the Plan is 12,000,000. No individual may receive in any year awards under the Plan, whether payable in cash or shares, that relate to more than 3,750,000 shares of FCX common stock.
The Plan may be amended or terminated at any time by FCXs Board of Directors, subject to the requirement that certain amendments may not be made without stockholder approval. In addition, no amendment may materially impair an award previously granted without the consent of the recipient. Unless terminated sooner, no awards will be made under the Plan after May 4, 2016.
For further information regarding the Plan, see FCXs 2006 Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 22, 2006. Each of the Plan, the Form of Notice of Grant of Nonqualified Stock Options under the Plan, the Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement under the Plan and the Form of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Agreement under the Plan are filed as exhibits to this Form 8-K (see Exhibits 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9).

Eligibility
. Any Eligible Individual shall be eligible to be granted an Award.
 
 
(a)
  
Shares Available for Awards
. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5(b):
 
(i)
  
Calculation of Number of Shares Available
.
 
(A)
  
Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5(a), the number of Shares with respect to which Awards payable in Shares may be granted under the Plan shall be 8,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. Awards that by their terms may be settled only in cash shall not be counted against the maximum number of Shares provided herein.
 
(B)
  
The number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to Incentive Stock Options may not exceed 8,000,000 Shares.
 
(C)
  
Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5(a):
 
(1)
  
the maximum number of Shares with respect to which Awards in the form of Restricted Stock or Other Stock-Based Awards payable in Shares for which a per share purchase price that is less than 100% of the fair market value of the securities to which the Award relates shall be 2,000,000 Shares; and
 
(2)
  
no more than 400,000 Shares may be issued pursuant to Awards in the form of Other Stock-Based Awards payable in Shares for which the vesting period is less than three years (with incremental vesting permitted), or one year (with incremental vesting permitted) if the grant or vesting is subject to the attainment of specified performance goals. If (x) an Other Stock-Based Award is granted with a minimum vesting period of at least three years or a minimum vesting period of at least one year, subject to the attainment of specific performance goals, and (y) the vesting of such Award is accelerated in accordance with Section 12(a) hereof as a result of the Participants death, retirement or other termination of employment or cessation of consulting or advisory services to the Company, or a change in control of the Company, such Shares shall not count against the 400,000 limitation described herein.
 
(D)
  
To the extent any Shares covered by an Award are not issued because the Award is forfeited or canceled or the Award is settled in cash, such Shares shall again be available for grant pursuant to new Awards under the Plan.
 
(E)
  
In the event that Shares are issued as Restricted Stock or Other Stock-Based Awards under the Plan and thereafter are forfeited or reacquired by the Company pursuant to rights reserved upon issuance thereof, such Shares shall again be available for grant pursuant to new Awards under the Plan.
 
(F)
  
If the exercise price of any Option is satisfied by tendering Shares to the Company, only the number of Shares issued net of the Shares tendered shall be deemed issued for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under Section 5(a)(i)(A). However, all of the Shares issued upon exercise shall be deemed issued for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to Incentive Stock Options.
 
(ii)
  
Shares Deliverable Under Awards
. Any Shares delivered pursuant to an Award may consist of authorized and unissued Shares or of treasury Shares, including Shares held by the Company or a Subsidiary and Shares acquired in the open market or otherwise obtained by the Company or a Subsidiary. The issuance of Shares may be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange.
 
(iii)
  
Individual Limit
. Any provision of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no individual may receive in any year Awards under the Plan, whether payable in cash or Shares, that relate to more than 2,500,000 Shares.
 
(iv)
  
Use of Shares
. Subject to the terms of the Plan and the overall limitation on the number of Shares that may be delivered under the Plan, the Committee may use available Shares as the form of payment for compensation, grants or rights earned or due under any other compensation plans or arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary, including, but not limited to, the Companys Annual Incentive Plan and the plans or arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary assumed in business combinations.
 
(b)
  
Adjustments
. In the event that the Committee determines that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, Subsidiary securities, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee may, in its sole discretion and in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) with respect to which Awards may be granted, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and (iii) the grant or exercise price with respect to any Award and, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding Award and, if deemed appropriate, adjust outstanding Awards to provide the rights contemplated by Section 11(b) hereof;
provided
, in each case, that with respect to Awards of Incentive Stock Options no such adjustment shall be authorized to the extent that such authority would cause the Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code or any successor provision thereto and, with respect to all Awards under the Plan, no such adjustment shall be authorized to the extent that such authority would be inconsistent with the requirements for full deductibility under Section 162(m); and
provided
 
further
that the number of Shares subject to any Award denominated in Shares shall always be a whole number.
 
 
(a)
  
Stock Options

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Eligible Individuals to whom Options shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Option, the option price thereof and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of the Option and the other terms thereof. The Committee shall have the authority to grant Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options or both. In the case of Incentive Stock Options, the terms and conditions of such grants shall be subject to and comply with such rules as may be required by Section 422 of the Code, as from time to time amended, and any implementing regulations. Except in the case of an Option granted in assumption of or substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines, the exercise price of any Option granted under this Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying Shares on the date of grant.
 
(b)
  
Exercise
. Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, specify in the applicable Award Agreement or thereafter, provided, however, that in no event may any Option granted hereunder be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years after the date of such grant. The Committee may impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options, including without limitation, any condition relating to the application of Federal or state securities laws, as it may deem necessary or advisable. An option may be exercised, in whole or in part, by giving written notice to the Company, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased. The exercise notice shall be accompanied by the full purchase price for the Shares.
 
(c)
  
Payment
. The Option price shall be payable in United States dollars and may be paid by (i) cash or cash equivalent; (ii) delivery of shares of Class B Common Stock, which shares shall be valued for this purpose at the fair market value (valued in accordance with procedures established by the Committee) as of the effective date of such exercise and, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, shall have been held by the optionee for at least six months; or (iii) in such other manner as may be authorized from time to time by the Committee. Prior to the issuance of Shares upon the exercise of an Option, a Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder.
 
 
(a)
  
Stock Appreciation Rights
. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Eligible Individuals to whom Stock Appreciation Rights shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Award of Stock Appreciation Rights, the grant price thereof and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right and the other terms thereof. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in tandem with another Award, in addition to another Award, or freestanding and unrelated to any other Award. Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with or in addition to an Option or other Award may be granted either at the same time as the Option or other Award or at a later time. Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years after the date of grant. Except in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in assumption of or substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines, the grant price of any Stock Appreciation Right granted under this Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Shares covered by such Stock Appreciation Right on the date of grant or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a then outstanding Option or other Award, on the date of grant of such related Option or Award.
 
(b)
  
A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the holder thereof to receive upon exercise, for each Share to which the Stock Appreciation Right relates, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a Share on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right over the grant price. Any Stock Appreciation Right shall be settled in cash, unless the Committee shall determine at the time of grant of a Stock Appreciation Right that it shall or may be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares.
 
 
(a)
  
Limited Rights
. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Eligible Individuals to whom Limited Rights shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Award of Limited Rights, the grant price thereof and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of the Limited Rights and the other terms thereof. Limited Rights may be granted in tandem with another Award, in addition to another Award, or freestanding and unrelated to any Award. Limited Rights granted in tandem with or in addition to an Award may be granted either at the same time as the Award or at a later time. Limited Rights shall not be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years after the date of grant and shall only be exercisable during a period determined at the time of grant by the Committee beginning not earlier than one day and ending not more than ninety days after the expiration date of an Offer. Except in the case of a Limited Right granted in assumption of or substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines, the grant price of any Limited Right granted under this Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Shares covered by such Limited Right on the date of grant or, in the case of a Limited Right granted in tandem with a then outstanding Option or other Award, on the date of grant of such related Option or Award.
 
(b)
  
A Limited Right shall entitle the holder thereof to receive upon exercise, for each Share to which the Limited Right relates, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Offer Price on the date of exercise of the Limited Right over the grant price. Any Limited Right shall be settled in cash, unless the Committee shall determine at the time of grant of a Limited Right that it shall or may be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares.
 
 
(a)
  
Grant of Restricted Stock
. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Eligible Individuals to whom Restricted Stock shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Award of Restricted Stock and the terms, conditions, and limitations applicable thereto. The Committee shall also have authority to grant restricted stock units. Restricted stock units shall be subject to the requirements applicable to Other Stock-Based Awards under Section 10. An Award of Restricted Stock may be subject to the attainment of specified performance goals or targets, restrictions on transfer, forfeitability provisions and such other terms and conditions as the Committee may determine, subject to the provisions of the Plan. An award of Restricted Stock may be made in lieu of the payment of cash compensation otherwise due to an Eligible Individual. To the extent that Restricted Stock is intended to qualify as performance- based compensation under Section 162(m), it must meet the additional requirements imposed thereby.
 
(b)
  
The Restricted Period
. At the time that an Award of Restricted Stock is made, the Committee shall establish a period of time during which the transfer of the Shares of Restricted Stock shall be restricted (the Restricted Period). Each Award of Restricted Stock may have a different Restricted Period. A Restricted Period of at least three years is required, with incremental vesting of the Award over the three-year period permitted. However, if the grant or vesting of the Shares is subject to the attainment of specified performance goals, a Restricted Period of at least one year with incremental vesting is permitted. The expiration of the Restricted Period shall also occur as provided in the Award Agreement in accordance with Section 12(a) hereof.
 
(c)
  
Escrow
. The Participant receiving Restricted Stock shall enter into an Award Agreement with the Company setting forth the conditions of the grant. Certificates representing Shares of Restricted Stock shall be registered in the name of the Participant and deposited with the Company, together with a stock power endorsed in blank by the Participant. Each such certificate shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:
 
The transferability of this certificate and the shares of Class B Common Stock represented by it are subject to the terms and conditions (including conditions of forfeiture) contained in the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan) and a notice of grant issued thereunder to the registered owner by Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. Copies of the Plan and the notice of grant are on file at the principal office of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.
(d)
  
Dividends on Restricted Stock
. Any and all cash and stock dividends paid with respect to the Shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to any restrictions on transfer, forfeitability provisions or reinvestment requirements as the Committee may, in its discretion, prescribe in the Award Agreement.
 
(e)
  
Forfeiture
. In the event of the forfeiture of any Shares of Restricted Stock under the terms provided in the Award Agreement (including any additional Shares of Restricted Stock that may result from the reinvestment of cash and stock dividends, if so provided in the Award Agreement), such forfeited shares shall be surrendered and the certificates canceled. The Participants shall have the same rights and privileges, and be subject to the same forfeiture provisions, with respect to any additional Shares received pursuant to Section 5(b) or Section 11(b) due to a recapitalization, merger or other change in capitalization.
 
(f)
  
Expiration of Restricted Period
. Upon the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of any other conditions prescribed by the Committee or at such earlier time as provided for in the Award Agreement or an amendment thereto, the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock shall lapse and a stock certificate for the number of Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which the restrictions have lapsed shall be delivered, free of all such restrictions and legends, except any that may be imposed by law, to the Participant or the Participants estate, as the case may be.
 
(g)
  
Rights as a Shareholder
. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and subject to any restrictions on the receipt of dividends that may be imposed in the Award Agreement, each Participant receiving Restricted Stock shall have all the rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares of stock during any period in which such Shares are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on transfer, including without limitation, the right to vote such Shares.
 
(h)
  
Performance-Based Restricted Stock under Section 162(m)
. The Committee shall determine at the time of grant if a grant of Restricted Stock is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation as that term is used in Section 162(m). Any such grant shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance measures. The performance measures pursuant to which the Restricted Stock shall vest shall be any or a combination of the following: earnings per share, return on assets, an economic value added measure, shareholder return, earnings, return on equity, return on investment, cash provided by operating activities, increase in cash flow, return on cash flow, or increase in production of the Company, a division of the Company or a Subsidiary. For any performance period, such performance objectives may be measured on an absolute basis or relative to a group of peer companies selected by the Committee, relative to internal goals or relative to levels attained in prior years. For grants of Restricted Stock intended to qualify as performance-based compensation, the grants of Restricted Stock and the establishment of performance measures shall be made during the period required under Section 162(m).
 
 
(a)
  
Other Stock-Based Awards
. The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Eligible Individuals an Other Stock-Based Award, which shall consist of an Award that is not an instrument or Award specified in Sections 6 through 9 of this Plan, the value of which is based in whole or in part on the value of Shares, including a restricted stock unit. Other Stock-Based Awards may be awards of Shares or may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Shares (including, without limitation, securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares), as deemed by the Committee consistent with the purposes of the Plan. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions, including any vesting requirements, of any such Other Stock-Based Award and may provide that such awards would be payable in whole or in part in cash. To the extent that an Other Stock-Based Award is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), it must be made subject to the attainment of one or more of the performance goals specified in Section 10(b) hereof and meet the additional requirements imposed by Section 162(m).
 
(b)
  
Performance-Based Other Stock-Based Awards under Section 162(m)
. The Committee shall determine at the time of grant if the grant of an Other Stock-Based Award is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation as that term is used in Section 162(m). Any such grant shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance measures. The performance measures pursuant to which the Other Stock-Based Award shall vest shall be any or a combination of the following: earnings per share, return on assets, an economic value added measure, shareholder return, earnings, return on equity, return on investment, cash provided by operating activities, increase in cash flow, return on cash flow, or increase in production of the Company, a division of the Company or a Subsidiary. For any performance period, such performance objectives may be measured on an absolute basis or relative to a group of peer companies selected by the Committee, relative to internal goals or relative to levels attained in prior years. For grants of Other Stock-Based Awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation, the grants of Other Stock-Based Awards and the establishment of performance measures shall be made during the period required under Section 162(m).
 
(c)
  
Dividend Equivalents
. In the sole and complete discretion of the Committee, an Award, whether made as an Other Stock-Based Award under this Section 10 or as an Award granted pursuant to Sections 6 through 9 hereof, may provide the holder thereof with dividends or dividend equivalents, payable in cash, Shares, Subsidiary securities, other securities or other property on a current or deferred basis.

without the approval of the stockholders, (a) increase, subject to adjustments permitted herein, the maximum number of shares of Class B Common Stock that may be issued through the Plan, (b) materially increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, (c) materially expand the classes of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, or (d) amend Section 11(c) to permit a reduction in the exercise price of Options; or

Adjustment of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events

The Committee is hereby authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, the events described in Section 5(b) hereof) affecting the Company, or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan.
 
(c)
  
Cancellation
. Any provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Committee may cause any Award granted hereunder to be canceled in consideration of a cash payment or alternative Award made to the holder of such canceled Award equal in value to such canceled Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for adjustments permitted under Sections 5(b) and 11(b), no action by the Committee shall cause a reduction in the exercise price of Options granted under the Plan without the approval of the stockholders of the Company. The determinations of value under this subparagraph shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion.
 
 
(a)
  
Award Agreements
. Each Award hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement or notice delivered to the Participant (by paper copy or electronically) that shall specify the terms and conditions thereof and any rules applicable thereto, including but not limited to the effect on such Award of the death, retirement or other termination of employment or cessation of consulting or advisory services of the Participant and the effect thereon, if any, of a change in control of the Company.
 
(b)
  
Withholding
.
(i)
A Participant shall be required to pay to the Company, and the Company shall have the right to deduct from all amounts paid to a Participant (whether under the Plan or otherwise), any taxes required by law to be paid or withheld in respect of Awards hereunder to such Participant. The Committee may provide for additional cash payments to holders of Awards to defray or offset any tax arising from the grant, vesting, exercise or payment of any Award.
 
(ii) At any time that a Participant is required to pay to the Company an amount required to be withheld under the applicable tax laws in connection with the issuance of Shares under the Plan, the Participant may, if permitted by the Committee, satisfy this obligation in whole or in part by delivering currently owned Shares or by electing (the Election) to have the Company withhold from the issuance Shares, which Shares shall have a value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld. The value of the Shares delivered or withheld shall be based on the fair market value of the Shares on the date as of which the amount of tax to be withheld shall be determined in accordance with applicable tax laws (the Tax Date).
 
(iii) Each Election to have Shares withheld must be made prior to the Tax Date. If a Participant wishes to deliver Shares in payment of taxes, the Participant must so notify the Company prior to the Tax Date.
 
(c)
  
Transferability
. No Awards granted hereunder may be transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise encumbered by a Participant except: (i) by will; (ii) by the laws of descent and distribution; (iii) pursuant to a domestic relations order, as defined in the Code, if permitted by the Committee and so provided in the Award Agreement or an amendment thereto; or (iv) if permitted by the Committee and so provided in the Award Agreement or an amendment thereto, Options and Limited Rights granted in tandem therewith may be transferred or assigned (w) to Immediate Family Members, (x) to a partnership in which Immediate Family Members, or entities in which Immediate Family Members are the owners, members or beneficiaries, as appropriate, are the partners, (y) to a limited liability company in which Immediate Family Members, or entities in which Immediate Family Members are the owners, members or beneficiaries, as appropriate, are the members, or (z) to a trust for the benefit of Immediate Family Members; provided, however, that no more than a
de minimus
beneficial interest in a partnership, limited liability company or trust described in (x), (y) or (z) above may be owned by a person who is not an Immediate Family Member or by an entity that is not beneficially owned solely by Immediate Family Members. Immediate Family Members shall be defined as the spouse and natural or adopted children or grandchildren of the Participant and their spouses. To the extent that an Incentive Stock Option is permitted to be transferred during the lifetime of the Participant, it shall be treated thereafter as a Nonqualified Stock Option. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of Awards, or levy of attachment or similar process upon Awards not specifically permitted herein, shall be null and void and without effect. The designation of a Designated Beneficiary shall not be a violation of this Section 12(c).
 
(d)
  
Share Certificates
. All certificates for Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any applicable federal or state laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
 
(e)
  
No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements
. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or continuing in effect other compensation arrangements, which may, but need not, provide for the grant of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other types of Awards provided for hereunder (subject to stockholder approval of any such arrangement if approval is required), and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
(f)
  
No Right to Employment
. The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of or as a consultant or adviser to the Company or any Subsidiary or in the employ of or as a consultant or adviser to any other entity providing services to the Company. The Company or any Subsidiary or any such entity may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, or terminate any arrangement pursuant to which the Participant provides services to the Company or a Subsidiary, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement. No Eligible Individual or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Individuals, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards.
 
(g)
  
Governing Law
. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
(h)
  
Severability
. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
 
(i)
  
No Trust or Fund Created
. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
 
(j)
  
No Fractional Shares
. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash, other securities or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated, or otherwise eliminated.
 
(k)
  
Deferral Permitted
. Payment of cash or distribution of any Shares to which a Participant is entitled under any Award shall be made as provided in the Award Agreement. Payment may be deferred at the option of the Participant if provided in the Award Agreement.

Term of the Plan
. Subject to Section 11(a), no Awards may be granted under the Plan later than ten years after the date the Plan was adopted by the Board; provided, however, that Awards granted prior to such date shall remain in effect until such Awards have either been satisfied, expired or canceled under the terms of the Plan, and any restrictions imposed on Shares in connection with their issuance under the Plan have lapsed.

(b)
  
A Limited Right shall entitle the holder thereof to receive upon exercise, for each Share to which the Limited Right relates, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Offer Price on the date of exercise of the Limited Right over the grant price.

The Participants shall have the same rights and privileges, and be subject to the same forfeiture provisions, with respect to any additional Shares received pursuant to Section 5(b) or Section 11(b) due to a recapitalization, merger or other change in capitalization.
 
(f)
  
Expiration of Restricted Period
. Upon the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of any other conditions prescribed by the Committee or at such earlier time as provided for in Section 9(b) and in the Award Agreement or an amendment thereto, the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock shall lapse and a stock certificate for the number of Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which the restrictions have lapsed shall be delivered, free of all such restrictions and legends, except any that may be imposed by law, to the Participant or the Participants estate, as the case may be.

(h)
  
Performance-Based Restricted Stock
. The Committee shall determine at the time of grant if a grant of Restricted Stock is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation as that term is used in Section 162(m). Any such grant shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance measures. The performance measures pursuant to which the Restricted Stock shall vest shall be any or a combination of the following: earnings per share, return on assets, an economic value added measure, shareholder return, earnings, return on equity, return on investment, cash provided by operating activities, increase in cash flow, or increase in production of the Company, a division of the Company or a Subsidiary. For any performance period, such performance objectives may be measured on an absolute basis or relative to a group of peer companies selected by the Committee, relative to internal goals or relative to levels attained in prior years. For grants of Restricted Stock intended to qualify as performance-based compensation, the grants of Restricted Stock and the establishment of performance measures shall be made during the period required under Section 162(m).
 
 
(a)
  
Other Stock-Based Awards
. The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Eligible Individuals an Other Stock-Based Award, which shall consist of an Award, the value of which is based in whole or in part on the value of Shares, that is not an instrument or Award specified in Sections 6 through 9 of this Plan. Other Stock-Based Awards may be awards of Shares or may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Shares (including, without limitation, restricted stock units or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares), as deemed by the Committee consistent with the purposes of the Plan. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of any such Other Stock-Based Award and may provide that such awards would be payable in whole or in part in cash. An Other Stock-Based Award may be subject to the attainment of such specified performance goals or targets as the Committee may determine, subject to the provisions of the Plan. To the extent that an Other Stock-Based Award is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), it must meet the additional requirements imposed thereby. Except in the case of an Other Stock-Based Award granted in assumption of or in substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines, the price at which securities may be purchased pursuant to any Other Stock-Based Award granted under this Plan, or the provision, if any, of any such Award that is analogous to the purchase or exercise price, shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the securities to which such Award relates on the date of grant. An Other-Stock Based Award, including an outright grant of Shares, may be made in lieu of the payment of cash compensation otherwise due to an Eligible Individual.
 
(b)
  
Performance-Based Other Stock-Based Awards
. The Committee shall determine at the time of grant if the grant of an Other Stock-Based Award is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation as that term is used in Section 162(m). Any such grant shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance measures. The performance measures pursuant to which the Other Stock-Based Award shall vest shall be any or a combination of the following: earnings per share, return on assets, an economic value added measure, shareholder return, earnings, return on equity, return on investment, cash provided by operating activities, increase in cash flow, or increase in production of the Company, a division of the Company or a Subsidiary. For any performance period, such performance objectives may be measured on an absolute basis or relative to a group of peer companies selected by the Committee, relative to internal goals or relative to levels attained in prior years. For grants of Other Stock-Based Awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation, the grants of Other Stock-Based Awards and the establishment of performance measures shall be made during the period required under Section 162(m).
 
(c)
  
Dividend Equivalents
. In the sole and complete discretion of the Committee, an Award, whether made as an Other Stock-Based Award under this Section 10 or as an Award granted pursuant to Sections 6 through 9 hereof, may provide the holder thereof with dividends or dividend equivalents, payable in cash, Shares, Subsidiary securities, other securities or other property on a current or deferred basis.
 
 
(a)
  
Amendments to the Plan
. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time, provided that no amendment shall be made without stockholder approval if such approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement, including for these purposes any approval necessary to qualify Awards as performance based compensation under Section 162(m) or any successor provision if such qualification is deemed necessary or advisable by the Committee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Committee may amend the Plan in such manner as may be necessary for the Plan to conform with local rules and regulations in any jurisdiction outside the United States.
 
(b)
  
Adjustment of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events
. The Committee is hereby authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, the events described in Section 5(b) hereof) affecting the Company, or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan.
 
(c)
  
Cancellation
. Any provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Committee may cause any Award granted hereunder to be canceled in consideration of a cash payment or alternative Award made to the holder of such canceled Award equal in value to such canceled Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Options granted under the Plan shall be repriced without the approval of the stockholders of the Company. The determinations of value under this subparagraph shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion.
 
 
(a)
  
Award Agreements
. Each Award hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement or notice delivered to the Participant (by paper copy or electronically) that shall specify the terms and conditions thereof and any rules applicable thereto, including but not limited to the effect on such Award of the death, retirement or other termination of employment or cessation of consulting or advisory services of the Participant and the effect thereon, if any, of a change in control of the Company.
 
(b)
  
Withholding
.
(i)
A Participant shall be required to pay to the Company, and the Company shall have the right to deduct from all amounts paid to a Participant (whether under the Plan or otherwise), any taxes required by law to be paid or withheld in respect of Awards hereunder to such Participant. The Committee may provide for additional cash payments to holders of Awards to defray or offset any tax arising from the grant, vesting, exercise or payment of any Award.
 
(ii) At any time that a Participant is required to pay to the Company an amount required to be withheld under the applicable tax laws in connection with the issuance of Shares under the Plan, the Participant may, if permitted by the Committee, satisfy this obligation in whole or in part by delivering currently owned Shares or by electing (the Election) to have the Company withhold from the issuance Shares, which Shares shall have a value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld. The value of the Shares delivered or withheld shall be based on the fair market value of the Shares on the date as of which the amount of tax to be withheld shall be determined in accordance with applicable tax laws (the Tax Date).
 
(iii) Each Election to have Shares withheld must be made prior to the Tax Date. If a Participant wishes to deliver Shares in payment of taxes, the Participant must so notify the Company prior to the Tax Date.
 
(c)
  
Transferability
. No Awards granted hereunder may be transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise encumbered by a Participant except: (i) by will; (ii) by the laws of descent and distribution; (iii) pursuant to a domestic relations order, as defined in the Code, if permitted by the Committee and so provided in the Award Agreement or an amendment thereto; or (iv) if permitted by the Committee and so provided in the Award Agreement or an amendment thereto, Options and Limited Rights granted in tandem therewith may be transferred or assigned (a) to Immediate Family Members, (b) to a partnership in which Immediate Family Members, or entities in which Immediate Family Members are the owners, members or beneficiaries, as appropriate, are the partners, (c) to a limited liability company in which Immediate Family Members, or entities in which Immediate Family Members are the owners, members or beneficiaries, as appropriate, are the members, or (d) to a trust for the benefit of Immediate Family Members; provided, however, that no more than a
de minimus
beneficial interest in a partnership, limited liability company or trust described in (b), (c) or (d) above may be owned by a person who is not an Immediate Family Member or by an entity that is not beneficially owned solely by Immediate Family Members. Immediate Family Members shall be defined as the spouse and natural or adopted children or grandchildren of the Participant and their spouses. To the extent that an Incentive Stock Option is permitted to be transferred during the lifetime of the Participant, it shall be treated thereafter as a Nonqualified Stock Option. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of Awards, or levy of attachment or similar process upon Awards not specifically permitted herein, shall be null and void and without effect. The designation of a Designated Beneficiary shall not be a violation of this Section 12(c).
 
(d)
  
Share Certificates
. All certificates for Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the SEC, any stock exchange upon which such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any applicable federal or state laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
 
(e)
  
No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements
. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or continuing in effect other compensation arrangements, which may, but need not, provide for the grant of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other types of Awards provided for hereunder (subject to stockholder approval of any such arrangement if approval is required), and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
(f)
  
No Right to Employment
. The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of or as a consultant or adviser to the Company or any Subsidiary or in the employ of or as a consultant or adviser to any other entity providing services to the Company. The Company or any Subsidiary or any such entity may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, or terminate any arrangement pursuant to which the Participant provides services to the Company or a Subsidiary, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement. No Eligible Individual or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Individuals, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards.
 
(g)
  
Governing Law
. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
(h)
  
Severability
. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
 
(i)
  
No Trust or Fund Created
. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
 
(j)
  
No Fractional Shares
. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash, other securities or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated, or otherwise eliminated.

Compliance with Law
. The Company intends that Awards granted under the Plan, or any deferrals thereof, will comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and all regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder, to the extent applicable.

Headings

Term of the Plan
. Subject to Section 11(a), no Awards may be granted under the Plan later than May 6, 2009, which is ten years after the date the Plan was approved by the Companys stockholders; provided, however, that Awards granted prior to such date shall remain in effect until all such Awards have either been satisfied, expired or canceled under the terms of the Plan, and any restrictions imposed on Shares in connection with their issuance under the Plan have lapsed.

In the case of Incentive Stock Options, the terms and conditions of such grants shall be subject to and comply with such rules as may be required by Section 422 of the Code, as from time to time amended, and any implementing regulations. Except in the case of an Option granted in assumption of or substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines, the exercise price of any Option granted under this Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying Shares on the date of grant.

Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in tandem with another Award, in addition to another Award, or freestanding and unrelated to any other Award. Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with or in addition to an Option or other Award may be granted either at the same time as the Option or other Award or at a later time. Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be exercisable earlier than six months after the date of grant nor after the expiration of 10 years after the date of grant.

(b)
  
A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the Participant to receive upon exercise, for each Share to which the SAR relates, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a Share on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right over the grant price.

Except in the case of a Limited Right granted in assumption of or substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines, the grant price of any Limited Right granted under this Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Shares covered by such Limited Right on the date of grant or, in the case of a Limited Right granted in tandem with a then outstanding Option or other Award, on the date of grant of such related Option or Award.
 
(b)
  
A Limited Right shall entitle the Participant to receive upon exercise, for each Share to which the Limited Right relates, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Offer Price on the date of exercise of the Limited Right over the grant price. Any Limited Right shall be settled in cash, unless the Committee shall determine at the time of grant of a Limited Right that it shall or may be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares.

A Participant shall be required to pay to the Company, and the Company shall have the right to deduct from all amounts paid to a Participant (whether under the Plan or otherwise), any taxes required by law to be paid or withheld in respect of Awards hereunder to such Participant. The Committee may provide for additional cash payments to holders of Awards to defray or offset any tax arising from the grant, vesting, exercise or payment of any Award.
 
(ii)
  
At any time that a Participant is required to pay to the Company an amount required to be withheld under the applicable tax laws in connection with the issuance of Shares under the Plan, the Participant may, if permitted by the Committee, satisfy this obligation in whole or in part by delivering currently owned Shares or by electing (the Election) to have the Company withhold from the issuance Shares, which Shares shall have a value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld. The value of the Shares delivered or withheld shall be based on the fair market value of the Shares on the date as of which the amount of tax to be withheld shall be determined in accordance with applicable tax laws (the Tax Date).
 
(iii)
  
Each Election to have Shares withheld must be made prior to the Tax Date. If a Participant wishes to deliver Shares in payment of taxes, the Participant must so notify the Company prior to the Tax Date.
 
(d)
  
Nontransferability
. No Award shall be transferable by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, to the maximum extent permitted by Rule 16b-3, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), as determined by the Committee. An Award may be exercised, during the Participants lifetime, only by the Participant or the transferee under the QDRO. The designation of a Designated Beneficiary shall not be a violation of this paragraph 11(d).
 
(e)
  
Share Certificates
. All certificates for Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the SEC, any stock exchange upon which such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any applicable federal or state laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
 
(f)
  
No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements
. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or continuing in effect other compensation arrangements, which may, but need not, provide for the grant of options, stock appreciation rights and other types of Awards provided for hereunder (subject to stockholder approval of any such arrangement if approval is required), and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
(g)
  
No Right to Employment
. The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary or in the employ of any other entity providing services to the Company. The Company or any Subsidiary or any such entity may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, or terminate any arrangement pursuant to which the Participant provides services to the Company, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement. No Employee, Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards.
 
(h)
  
Governing Law
. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
(i)
  
Severability
. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
 
(j)
  
No Trust or Fund Created
. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
 
(k)
  
No Fractional Shares
. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash, other securities or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated, or otherwise eliminated.
 
(l)
  
Headings
. Headings are given to the subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.
 
 
Effective Date of the Plan
. The Plan shall be effective as of the date of its approval by the holders of the common stock of the Company.
 
 
Term of the Plan
. No Award shall be granted under the Plan after the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan; however, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an applicable Award Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may, and the authority of the Committee to amend, alter, adjust, suspend, discontinue, or terminate any such Award or to waive any conditions or rights under any such Award shall, extend beyond such date.

THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1, dated and effective May ____, 2006, to the Notice of Grant of Nonqualified Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (the Notice), is by and between Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (the Company) and ______________ (the Director).
 
WHEREAS, under the terms of the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. 2004 Director Compensation Plan (the Plan) and pursuant to the Notice, the Director, a former advisory director of the Company, was granted effective May 9, 2004 and with the approval of the Companys stockholders, options to purchase shares of Class B common stock and stock appreciation rights with respect to shares of Class B common stock (the Replacement Grants) to replace previous awards of options and stock appreciation rights that terminated in accordance with their terms as a result of the Directors resignation from the board of directors on February 9, 2004;
 
WHEREAS, the applicable exercise and base prices of the Replacement Grants were equal to the corresponding exercise and base prices of the expired awards, thus were not equal to the fair market value of the Class B common stock on May 9, 2004;
 
WHEREAS, new Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A), imposes additional tax and penalties on stock options and stock appreciation rights granted with an exercise or base price that is less than fair market value on the date of grant; and
 
WHEREAS, as permitted by the guidance and proposed regulations related to Section 409A, the Company and the Director desire to (i) amend the terms of the portions of the Replacement Grants, which are more fully described on Appendix A hereof, that were not fully vested prior to December 31, 2004 and that were not subsequently cancelled through exercise prior to December 31, 2005, to increase the exercise or base price of the particular awards to $29.10, which is the fair market value of the Common Stock on May 9, 2004 (the date of grant), and (ii) to provide for cash payments subject to a vesting schedule to compensate the Director for the loss resulting from the increase in the exercise and base price of the awards.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the Company and the Director agree as follows:
 
1.
  
The exercise price of certain stock options and the base price of certain stock appreciation rights granted pursuant to the Notice, as set forth on Appendix A, shall be $29.10.
 
2.
  
The Director shall be entitled to a cash payment upon vesting equal to the difference in the original exercise or base price of the award and $29.10, which cash payments shall be made on the dates indicated on Appendix A.
 
3.
  
Except to the extent amended herein, all other provisions in the Notice shall remain unchanged.

Awards that by their terms may be settled only in cash shall not be counted against the maximum number of Shares provided herein.

With respect to Stock Appreciation Rights, if the Award is payable in Shares, all Shares to which the Award relates shall be counted against the Plan limits, rather than the net number of Shares delivered upon exercise of the Award.
 
(ii)
  
Shares Deliverable Under Awards
. Any Shares delivered pursuant to an Award may consist of authorized and unissued Shares or of treasury Shares, including Shares held by the Company or a Subsidiary and Shares acquired in the open market or otherwise obtained by the Company or a Subsidiary.

In the event that the Committee determines that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, Subsidiary securities, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee may, in its sole discretion and in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) with respect to which Awards may be granted, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and (iii) the grant or exercise price with respect to any Award and, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding Award and, if deemed appropriate, adjust outstanding Awards to provide the rights contemplated by Section 11(b) hereof;
provided
, in each case, that with respect to Awards of Incentive Stock Options no such adjustment shall be authorized to the extent that such authority would cause the Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code or any successor provision thereto and, with respect to all Awards under the Plan, no such adjustment shall be authorized to the extent that such authority would be inconsistent with the requirements for full deductibility under Section 162(m); and

(c)
  
Performance Goals for Section 162(m) Awards

The performance measures pursuant to which the Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Other Stock-Based Award shall vest shall be any or a combination of the following: earnings per share, return on assets, an economic value added measure, shareholder return, earnings, return on equity, return on investment, cash provided by operating activities, increase in cash flow, return on cash flow, or increase in production of the Company, a division of the Company or a Subsidiary. For any performance period, such performance objectives may be measured on an absolute basis or relative to a group of peer companies selected by the Committee, relative to internal goals or relative to levels attained in prior years. For grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Other Stock-Based Awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation, the grants and the establishment of performance measures shall be made during the period required under Section 162(m).
 
 
(a)
  
Stock Options
. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Eligible Individuals to whom Options shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Option, the option price thereof and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of the Option and the other terms thereof. The Committee shall have the authority to grant Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options or both. In the case of Incentive Stock Options, the terms and conditions of such grants shall be subject to and comply with such rules as may be required by Section 422 of the Code, as from time to time amended, and any implementing regulations. Except in the case of an Option granted in assumption of or substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines, the exercise price of any Option granted under this Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying Shares on the date of grant.
 
(b)
  
Exercise
. Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, specify in the applicable Award Agreement or thereafter, provided, however, that in no event may any Option granted hereunder be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years after the date of such grant. The Committee may impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options, including without limitation, any condition relating to the application of Federal or state securities laws, as it may deem necessary or advisable. An Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, by giving written notice to the Company, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased. The exercise notice shall be accompanied by the full purchase price for the Shares.
 
(c)
  
Payment
. The Option price shall be payable in United States dollars and may be paid by (i) cash or cash equivalent; (ii) delivery of shares of Class B Common Stock, subject to any holding periods established by the Committee; (iii) through a cashless exercise arrangement with a broker approved in advance by the Committee; (iv) if approved by the Committee, through a net exercise procedure whereby shares of Class B Common Stock equal in value to the aggregate exercise price or less are withheld from the shares issued upon exercise; or (v) in such other manner as may be authorized from time to time by the Committee. In the event shares of Class B Common Stock are delivered or withheld pursuant to (ii) or (iv) above, as applicable, the shares shall be valued at the fair market value (valued in accordance with procedures established by the Committee) on the effective date of the exercise. Prior to the issuance of Shares upon the exercise of an Option, a Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder.
 
 
(a)
  
Stock Appreciation Rights

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Eligible Individuals to whom Stock Appreciation Rights shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Award of Stock Appreciation Rights, the grant price thereof and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right and the other terms thereof. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in tandem with another Award, in addition to another Award, or freestanding and unrelated to any other Award. Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with or in addition to an Option or other Award may be granted either at the same time as the Option or other Award or at a later time. Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years after the date of grant. Except in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in assumption of or substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines, the grant price of any Stock Appreciation Right granted under this Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Shares covered by such Stock Appreciation Right on the date of grant or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a then outstanding Option or other Award, on the date of grant of such related Option or Award if permitted by Section 409A.
 
(b)
  
A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the holder thereof to receive upon exercise, for each Share to which the Stock Appreciation Right relates, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of a Share on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right over the grant price. The Committee shall determine at the time of grant of a Stock Appreciation Right whether it shall be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares.
 
 
(a)
  
Restricted Stock
. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Eligible Individuals to whom Restricted Stock shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Award of Restricted Stock and the terms, conditions, and limitations applicable thereto. An Award of Restricted Stock may be subject to the attainment of specified performance goals or targets, restrictions on transfer, forfeitability provisions and such other terms and conditions as the Committee may determine, subject to the provisions of the Plan. An award of Restricted Stock may be made in lieu of the payment of cash compensation otherwise due to an Eligible Individual. To the extent that Restricted Stock is intended to qualify as performance- based compensation under Section 162(m), it must be made subject to the attainment of one or more of the performance goals specified in Section 5(c) hereof and meet the additional requirements imposed by Section 162(m).
 
(b)
  
The Restricted Period
. At the time that an Award of Restricted Stock is made, the Committee shall establish a period of time during which the transfer of the Shares of Restricted Stock shall be restricted (the Restricted Period). Each Award of Restricted Stock may have a different Restricted Period. Except for Restricted Stock that vests on the attainment of performance goals, and except as provided in Section 5(a)(i)(C)(2), a Restricted Period of at least three years is required, with incremental vesting of the Award over the three-year period permitted. If the grant or vesting of the Shares is subject to the attainment of specified performance goals, a Restricted Period of at least one year with incremental vesting is permitted. The expiration of the Restricted Period shall also occur as provided in the Award Agreement in accordance with Section 12(a) hereof.
 
(c)
  
Escrow
. The Participant receiving Restricted Stock shall enter into an Award Agreement with the Company setting forth the conditions of the grant. Certificates representing Shares of Restricted Stock shall be registered in the name of the Participant and deposited with the Company, together with a stock power endorsed in blank by the Participant. Each such certificate shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:
 
The transferability of this certificate and the shares of Class B Common Stock represented by it are subject to the terms and conditions (including conditions of forfeiture) contained in the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan) and a notice of grant issued thereunder to the registered owner by Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. Copies of the Plan and the notice of grant are on file at the principal office of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.
 
(d)
  
Dividends on Restricted Stock
. Any and all cash and stock dividends paid with respect to the Shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to any restrictions on transfer, forfeitability provisions or reinvestment requirements as the Committee may, in its discretion, prescribe in the Award Agreement.
 
(e)
  
Forfeiture
. In the event of the forfeiture of any Shares of Restricted Stock under the terms provided in the Award Agreement (including any additional Shares of Restricted Stock that may result from the reinvestment of cash and stock dividends, if so provided in the Award Agreement), such forfeited shares shall be surrendered and the certificates canceled. The Participants shall have the same rights and privileges, and be subject to the same forfeiture provisions, with respect to any additional Shares received pursuant to Section 5(b) or Section 11(b) due to a recapitalization, merger or other change in capitalization.
 
(f)
  
Expiration of Restricted Period
. Upon the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of any other conditions prescribed by the Committee or at such earlier time as provided in the Award Agreement or an amendment thereto, the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock shall lapse and a stock certificate for the number of Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which the restrictions have lapsed shall be delivered, free of all such restrictions and legends, except any that may be imposed by law, to the Participant or the Participants estate, as the case may be.
 
(g)
  
Rights as a Stockholder
. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and subject to any restrictions on the receipt of dividends that may be imposed in the Award Agreement, each Participant receiving Restricted Stock shall have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares of stock during any period in which such Shares are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on transfer, including without limitation, the right to vote such Shares.
 
 
(a)
  
Restricted Stock Units
. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Eligible Individuals to whom Restricted Stock Units shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Award of Restricted Stock Units and the terms, conditions, and limitations applicable thereto. An Award of Restricted Stock Units is a right to receive shares of Common Stock in the future and may be subject to the attainment of specified performance goals or targets, restrictions on transfer, forfeitability provisions and such other terms and conditions as the Committee may determine, subject to the provisions of the Plan. An award of Restricted Stock Units may be made in lieu of the payment of cash compensation otherwise due to an Eligible Individual. To the extent that an Award of Restricted Stock Units is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), it must be made subject to the attainment of one or more of the performance goals specified in Section 5(c) hereof and meet the additional requirements imposed by Section 162(m).
 
(b)
  
The Vesting Period
. At the time that an Award of Restricted Stock Units is made, the Committee shall establish a period of time during which the Restricted Stock Units shall vest (the Vesting Period). Each Award of Restricted Stock may have a different Vesting Period. Except for Restricted Stock Units that vest based on the attainment of performance goals, and except as provided in Section 5(a)(i)(C)(2), a Vesting Period of at least three years is required with incremental vesting of the Award over the three-year period permitted. If the grant or vesting is subject to the attainment of specified performance goals, a Vesting Period of at least one year with incremental vesting is permitted. The expiration of the Vesting Period shall also occur as provided in the Award Agreement in accordance with Section 12(a) hereof.
 
(c)
  
Rights as a Stockholder
. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and subject to any restrictions that may be imposed in the Award Agreement, each Participant receiving Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to such Restricted Stock Units until such time as Shares are issued to the Participant.
 
 
(a)
  
Other Stock-Based Awards
. The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Eligible Individuals an Other Stock-Based Award, which shall consist of an Award that is not an instrument or Award specified in Sections 6 through 9 of this Plan, the value of which is based in whole or in part on the value of Shares. Other Stock-Based Awards may be awards of Shares or may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Shares (including, without limitation, securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares), as deemed by the Committee consistent with the purposes of the Plan. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of any such Other Stock-Based Award and may provide that such awards would be payable in whole or in part in cash. To the extent that an Other Stock-Based Award is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), it must be made subject to the attainment of one or more of the performance goals specified in Section 5(c) hereof and meet the additional requirements imposed by Section 162(m).
 
(b)
  
Limitations
. Except for Other Stock-Based Awards that vest based on the attainment of performance goals, and except as provided in Section 5(a)(i)(C)(2), a vesting period of at least three years is required with incremental vesting of the Award over the three-year period permitted. If the grant or vesting is subject to the attainment of specified performance goals, a vesting period of at least one year with incremental vesting is permitted. The expiration of the vesting period shall also occur as provided in the Award Agreement in accordance with Section 12(a) hereof.
 
(c)
  
Dividend Equivalents
. In the sole and complete discretion of the Committee, an Award, whether made as an Other Stock-Based Award under this Section 10 or as an Award granted pursuant to Sections 6 through 9 hereof, may provide the holder thereof with dividends or dividend equivalents, payable in cash, Shares, Subsidiary securities, other securities or other property on a current or deferred basis.
 
 
(a)
  
Amendment or Discontinuance of the Plan
. The Board may amend or discontinue the Plan at any time; provided, however, that no such amendment may
 
(i)
  
without the approval of the stockholders, (a) increase, subject to adjustments permitted herein, the maximum number of shares of Class B Common Stock that may be issued through the Plan, (b) materially increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, (c) materially expand the classes of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d) expand the types of Awards available for grant under the Plan, (e) materially extend the term of the Plan, (f) materially change the method of determining the exercise price of Options or the grant price of Stock Appreciation Rights, and (g) amend Section 11(c) to permit a reduction in the exercise price of Options; or
 
(ii)
  
materially impair, without the consent of the recipient, an Award previously granted.
 
(b)
  
Adjustment of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events
. The Committee is hereby authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, the events described in Section 5(b) hereof) affecting the Company, or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan.
 
(c)
  
Cancellation
. Any provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Committee may cause any Award granted hereunder to be canceled in consideration of a cash payment or alternative Award made to the holder of such canceled Award equal in value to such canceled Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for adjustments permitted under Sections 5(b) and 11(b), no action by the Committee shall, unless approved by the stockholders of the Company, (i) cause a reduction in the exercise price of Options granted under the Plan or (ii) permit an outstanding Option with an exercise price greater than the current fair market value of a Share to be surrendered as consideration for a new Option with a lower exercise price, shares of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Other Stock-Based Awards, a cash payment or Common Stock. The determinations of value under this subparagraph shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion.
 
 
(a)
  
Award Agreements
. Each Award hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement or notice delivered to the Participant (by paper copy or electronically) that shall specify the terms and conditions thereof and any rules applicable thereto, including but not limited to the effect on such Award of the death, retirement or other termination of employment or cessation of consulting or advisory services of the Participant and the effect thereon, if any, of a change in control of the Company.
 
(b)
  
Withholding
.
(i)
A Participant shall be required to pay to the Company, and the Company shall have the right to deduct from all amounts paid to a Participant (whether under the Plan or otherwise), any taxes required by law to be paid or withheld in respect of Awards hereunder to such Participant. The Committee may provide for additional cash payments to holders of Awards to defray or offset any tax arising from the grant, vesting, exercise or payment of any Award.
 
(ii)
  
At any time that a Participant is required to pay to the Company an amount required to be withheld under the applicable tax laws in connection with the issuance of Shares under the Plan, the Participant may, if permitted by the Committee, satisfy this obligation in whole or in part by delivering currently owned Shares or by electing (the Election) to have the Company withhold from the issuance Shares, which Shares shall have a value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld. The value of the Shares delivered or withheld shall be based on the fair market value of the Shares on the date as of which the amount of tax to be withheld shall be determined in accordance with applicable tax laws (the Tax Date).
 
(iii)
  
Each Election to have Shares withheld must be made prior to the Tax Date. If a Participant wishes to deliver Shares in payment of taxes, the Participant must so notify the Company prior to the Tax Date.
 
(c)
  
Transferability
. No Awards granted hereunder may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise encumbered by a Participant except: (i) by will; (ii) by the laws of descent and distribution; (iii) pursuant to a domestic relations order, as defined in the Code, if permitted by the Committee and so provided in the Award Agreement or an amendment thereto; or (iv) if permitted by the Committee and so provided in the Award Agreement or an amendment thereto, Options may be transferred or assigned (w) to Immediate Family Members, (x) to a partnership in which Immediate Family Members, or entities in which Immediate Family Members are the owners, members or beneficiaries, as appropriate, are the partners, (y) to a limited liability company in which Immediate Family Members, or entities in which Immediate Family Members are the owners, members or beneficiaries, as appropriate, are the members, or (z) to a trust for the benefit of Immediate Family Members; provided, however, that no more than a
de minimus
beneficial interest in a partnership, limited liability company or trust described in (x), (y) or (z) above may be owned by a person who is not an Immediate Family Member or by an entity that is not beneficially owned solely by Immediate Family Members. Immediate Family Members shall be defined as the spouse and natural or adopted children or grandchildren of the Participant and their spouses. To the extent that an Incentive Stock Option is permitted to be transferred during the lifetime of the Participant, it shall be treated thereafter as a Nonqualified Stock Option. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of Awards, or levy of attachment or similar process upon Awards not specifically permitted herein, shall be null and void and without effect. The designation of a Designated Beneficiary shall not be a violation of this Section 12(c).
 
(d)
  
Share Certificates
. All certificates for Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any applicable federal or state laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
 
(e)
  
No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements
. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or continuing in effect other compensation arrangements, which may, but need not, provide for the grant of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other types of Awards provided for hereunder (subject to stockholder approval of any such arrangement if approval is required), and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
(f)
  
No Right to Employment
. The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of or as a consultant or adviser to the Company or any Subsidiary or in the employ of or as a consultant or adviser to any other entity providing services to the Company. The Company or any Subsidiary or any such entity may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, or terminate any arrangement pursuant to which the Participant provides services to the Company or a Subsidiary, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement. No Eligible Individual or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Individuals, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards.
 
(g)
  
Governing Law
. The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations relating to the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
(h)
  
Severability
. If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
 
(i)
  
No Trust or Fund Created
. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
 
(j)
  
No Fractional Shares
. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash, other securities or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated, or otherwise eliminated.
 
(k)
  
Deferral Permitted
. Payment of cash or distribution of any Shares to which a Participant is entitled under any Award shall be made as provided in the Award Agreement. Payment may be deferred at the option of the Participant if provided in the Award Agreement.
 
(l)
  
Compliance with Law
. The Company intends that Awards granted under the Plan, or any deferrals thereof, will comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and all regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder, to the extent applicable.
 
(m)
  
Headings
. Headings are given to the subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.
 
 
Term of the Plan
. Subject to Section 11(a), no Awards may be granted under the Plan after May 4, 2016, which is ten years after the date the Plan was approved by the Companys stockholders; provided, however, that Awards granted prior to such date shall remain in effect until such Awards have either been satisfied, expired or canceled under the terms of the Plan, and any restrictions imposed on Shares in connection with their issuance under the Plan have lapsed.

(b)
  
Defined terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Section 2 of the Plan.
 
(c)
  
Subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions set forth in the Plan and herein, each RSU granted hereunder represents the right to receive from the Company, on the respective scheduled vesting date for such RSU set forth in Section 2(a) of this Agreement or on such earlier date as provided in Section 2(b) of this Agreement or Section 6(b) of this Agreement (the Vesting Date), one share (a Share) of Class B Common Stock of the Company (Common Stock), free of any restrictions, all amounts notionally credited to the Participants Dividend Equivalent Account (as defined in Section 4 of this Agreement) with respect to such RSU, and all securities and property comprising all Property Distributions (as defined in Section 4 of this Agreement) deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Account with respect to such RSU.
 
(d)
  
Provided the condition of Section 7 of this Agreement, if applicable, has been met, as soon as practicable after the Vesting Date (but no later than 2  months from such date) for any RSUs granted hereunder, the Participant shall receive from the Company the number of Shares to which the vested RSUs relate, free of any restrictions, a cash payment for all amounts notionally credited to the Participants Dividend Equivalent Account with respect to such vested RSUs (unless the receipt of such Shares and amounts has been deferred by the Participant pursuant to the provisions of Section 5(a) of this Agreement), and all securities and property comprising all Property Distributions deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Account with respect to such vested RSUs.
 
2.
  
(a)
The RSUs granted hereunder are granted to the Participant in accordance with the Participants election (the Election) to receive RSUs in lieu of certain cash bonus payments awarded under the Companys 2005 Annual Incentive Plan, which Election was made within the time period required by Section 409A of the Code. Provided the condition of Section 7 of this Agreement has been met, the RSUs granted hereunder shall vest in installments as follows:

Until the respective Vesting Date for an RSU granted hereunder, such RSU, all amounts notionally credited in any Dividend Equivalent Account related to such RSU, and all securities or property comprising all Property Distributions deposited in such Dividend Equivalent Account related to such RSU shall be subject to forfeiture as provided in Section 6 of this Agreement.
 
3.
  
Except as provided in Section 4 of this Agreement, an RSU shall not entitle the Participant to any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in any Share until the RSU shall vest and the Participant shall be issued the Share to which such RSU relates nor in any securities or property comprising any Property Distribution deposited in a Dividend Equivalent Account related to such RSU until such RSU vests.

Common Stock to which the Participant would have been entitled had the Participant been a record holder of one share of Common Stock at all times from the Grant Date to such issuance date (a Property Distribution). All such credits shall be made notionally to a dividend equivalent account (a Dividend Equivalent Account) established for the Participant with respect to all RSUs granted hereunder with the same Vesting Date.

The deferral is subject to the following limitations:
 
(i)
  
If the Participant is a Key Employee, a distribution of deferred amounts triggered by the Participants separation from service (as that term is defined pursuant to Section 409A of the Code) may not occur or begin until six months after the date (the Termination Date) the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Individual (the Termination).
 
(ii)
  
The deferral period with respect to any Participant

(iii)
  
The deferral period with respect to any Participant shall end three years after the Termination Date if the Participants Termination occurs by reason of the Participants Disability or Retirement.
 
(iv)
