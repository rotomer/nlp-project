HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
NEW ORLEANS, LA, July 18, 2006 -- Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported second-quarter 2006 net income applicable to common stock of $367.3 million, $1.74 per share, compared with net income of $175.2 million, $0.91 per share, for the second quarter of 2005. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, FCX reported net income of $618.9 million, $2.97 per share, compared with $305.6 million, $1.62 per share, in the 2005 period. Net income for the second quarter and first six months of 2006 included a gain of $8.6 million ($0.04 per share) from the disposition of land owned by Atlantic Copper, FCXs wholly owned Spanish smelting unit. Net income for the first six months of 2006 also included losses of $38.1 million ($0.17 per share) on debt reductions.

SUMMARY FINANCIAL TABLE
 
 
James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board of FCX, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, said, 
The combination of our world-class Grasberg operations and positive copper and gold markets continues to provide strong financial results. Favorable market conditions for our commodities are enabling us to return significant cash to our shareholders while we are taking actions to strengthen our balance sheet. The outlook for our business is positive. We are committed to realizing long-term values for our shareholders by producing our Grasberg open pit and underground resources in a safe and cost efficient manner and by continuing to add to these resources through our ongoing exploration and development activities.
 
PT-FI PRODUCTION AND SALES
PT-FI mined lower grade ore and reported lower production and sales in the second quarter of 2006 than in the second quarter of 2005. PT-FIs share of second-quarter 2006 production totaled 237.1 million pounds of copper and 307.3 thousand ounces of gold. PT-FI experienced weather-related shipping delays at the end of June, resulting in PT-FIs share of second-quarter 2006 copper sales of 220.1 million pounds being lower than the previous estimate of 235.0 million pounds announced on June 5, 2006. PT-FIs share of second-quarter 2006 gold sales of 278.0 thousand ounces slightly exceeded the previous estimate of 275.0 thousand ounces. As previously reported, in May 2006 PT-FI encountered a relatively small section of ore in the 6 North pushback with abnormally high clay content, which adversely affected ore flow, mill recoveries and concentrate grades. Operations improved during June as PT-FI gained access to better ore types.

In the second quarter of 2006, copper ore grades averaged 0.72 percent and recovery rates averaged 84.1 percent, compared with 0.98 percent and 87.4 percent for the second quarter of 2005. Gold ore grades averaged 0.67 grams per metric ton (g/t) and recovery rates averaged 76.4 percent in the second quarter of 2006, compared with 1.43 g/t and 83.8 percent for the second quarter of 2005. Average ore grades are expected to improve in the second half of 2006 with the highest grades expected to be mined in the fourth quarter.
 
Mill throughput, which varies depending on ore types being processed, averaged 223,700 metric tons of ore per day in the second quarter of 2006 compared with 211,800 metric tons of ore in the second quarter of 2005. Mill rates are expected to average over 220,000 metric tons of ore per day in the second half of 2006.
 
Production from PT-FIs Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine averaged 47,200 metric tons of ore per day in the second quarter of 2006, representing 21 percent of mill throughput. DOZ continues to perform above design capacity of 35,000 metric tons of ore per day. PT-FI is expanding the capacity of the DOZ underground operation to a sustained rate of 50,000 metric tons per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation, expected to be completed in mid-2007. PT-FI is completing plans that are anticipated to expand the capacity of the DOZ mine to 80,000 metric tons per day. The DOZ mine is one of the worlds largest underground mines.
 
Realized copper prices more than doubled to an average of $3.33 per pound in the second quarter of 2006 from $1.53 per pound in the second quarter of 2005. The spot copper price on the London Metal Exchange (LME) closed at $3.56 per pound on July 17, 2006. Realized gold prices improved by 43 percent to an average of $613.77 per ounce in the second quarter of 2006 from $428.23 per ounce in the second quarter of 2005. The London P.M. gold fixing price closed at $652.50 per ounce on July 17, 2006.
 
FCXs concentrate sales for the second quarter of 2006 included 185.1 million pounds of copper, priced at an average of $3.34 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. Each $0.05 change in the price realized from the June 30 price would result in an approximate $5 million effect on FCXs 2006 net income. Second-quarter 2006 adjustments to concentrate sales recognized in prior quarters increased revenues by $146.6 million ($77.7 million to net income or $0.35 per share) compared with $12.6 million ($6.7 million to net income or $0.03 per share) in the second quarter of 2005.
 
PT-FIs share of annual sales in 2006 is currently projected to approximate 1.2 billion pounds of copper and 1.7 million ounces of gold, compared with previous estimates of 1.3 billion pounds and 1.7 million ounces. The reduction in estimated copper sales primarily reflects the operational issues experienced in the second quarter and the impact of mine plan revisions to incorporate geotechnical data. Efforts are under way to improve productivity of mining activities which would increase mining rates and advance timing of metal production. At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing in mining areas with varying ore grades causes fluctuations in the timing of ore production, resulting in varying quarterly and annual sales of copper and gold. During 2006, approximately 63 percent of copper and 55 percent of gold sales are expected in the second half of the year, including 280.0 million pounds of copper and 320.0 thousand ounces of gold in the third quarter of 2006 and 475.0 million pounds of copper and 610.0 thousand ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of 2006. The achievement of PT-FIs sales estimates will be dependent, among other factors, on the achievement of targeted mining rates, the successful operation of PT-FI production facilities and the impact of weather conditions at the end of fiscal periods on concentrate loading activities.
 
PT-FIs mine plans are based on latest available data and studies, which take into account factors such as mining and milling rates, ore grades and recoveries, economic conditions and geologic/geotechnical considerations. PT-FI updates these plans to incorporate new data and conditions, with the objective of operating safely, managing risks and maximizing economic values. While ongoing analyses may alter current expectations, PT-FIs five-year mine plan has been revised as follows:

PT-FIs Share of Sales
 
These revisions include updated estimates for 2006 and design changes to incorporate recent geotechnical data, resulting in deferral of production of certain high-grade ore from 2007 and 2008 into future periods. The revised mine plans also incorporate an anticipated expansion of the DOZ underground mine to 80,000 metric tons of ore per day, which would accelerate the production of high grade ore from DOZ. The preliminary economics of this project appear highly attractive. The mine plan changes affect the timing of metal production and do not impact ultimate recoverable reserves. PT-FIs initiatives to improve productivity and mining rates are an important factor in the ability to meet or potentially to exceed these plans.
 
PT-FI is also continuing to analyze its longer range mine plans to assess the optimal design of the Grasberg open pit, which may affect the timing of development of the Grasberg underground block cave ore body. PT-FIs previous plan included the transition from the Grasberg open pit to the Grasberg block cave ore body in 2015. PT-FI expects to complete the current studies on longer range plans by year-end 2006.
 
UNIT NET CASH COSTS
 
 
PT-FIs unit net cash costs, including gold and silver credits, averaged $0.98 per pound of copper during the second quarter of 2006, compared with $0.11 per pound in the 2005 quarter. The higher unit site production and delivery costs in the 2006 period primarily reflected lower sales volumes resulting from mine sequencing in the Grasberg open pit,
 
higher treatment charges and royalties attributable to increased copper prices, the
 
impact of changes in accounting for stripping

costs and higher input costs, including energy. Unit site production and delivery costs will vary with fluctuations in production volumes because of the primarily fixed nature of PT-FIs cost structure.
 
On January 1, 2006, FCX adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-6, Accounting for Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry (EITF 04-6), which requires that stripping costs be included in costs of sales as incurred beginning in 2006. Upon adoption of EITF 04-6, FCX eliminated its deferred mining cost asset ($285.4 million) at December 31, 2005, net of taxes, minority interest share and inventory effects ($135.9 million), as a cumulative effect adjustment which reduced its retained earnings on January 1, 2006. Unit site production and delivery costs were net of deferred mining costs of $0.07 per pound ($20.6 million) in the second quarter of 2005 and $0.08 per pound ($52.8 million) in the first six months of 2005.
 
Assuming average copper prices of $3.00 per pound and average gold prices of $600 per ounce for the remainder of 2006 and achievement of current 2006 sales estimates, PT-FI estimates that its annual 2006 unit net cash costs, including gold and silver credits, would approximate $0.66 per pound. Estimated unit net cash costs for 2006 are projected to be higher than the 2005 average, primarily because of lower 2006 copper and gold sales volumes, higher treatment charges and royalties attributable to increased copper prices and the change in the accounting treatment of stripping costs. Estimated average 2006 unit net cash costs are higher than previous estimates of $0.54 per pound, primarily reflecting the impact of higher copper prices on treatment charges and royalties, lower copper volumes and higher energy costs. Unit net cash costs for 2006 would change by approximately $0.02 per pound for each $25 per ounce change in the average price of gold for the balance of the year.
 
SMELTER OPERATIONS
FCXs investment in smelters serves an important role in its concentrate marketing strategy. Through downstream integration, FCX assures placement of a significant portion of its concentrate production. Taking into account taxes and minority ownership interests, an equivalent change in smelting and refining charges essentially offset in FCXs consolidated operating results.
 
Atlantic Copper treated 228,900 metric tons of concentrate and scrap in the second quarter of 2006, compared with 246,900 metric tons in the year-ago period. Atlantic Copper produced 131.5 million pounds of cathodes and sold 131.1 million pounds of cathodes during the second quarter of 2006, compared with cathode production of 137.8 million pounds and sales of 140.8 million pounds during the second quarter of 2005. Treatment charges received by Atlantic Copper averaged $0.34 per pound during the second quarter of 2006 and $0.21 per pound during the second quarter of 2005. The significant increase in treatment charges in the 2006 period reflects higher market rates and $0.09 per pound ($0.03 per pound in the second quarter of 2005) for price participation under the terms of Atlantic Coppers concentrate purchase and sales agreements. Cathode cash unit costs averaged $0.21 per pound in the second quarter of 2006 and $0.18 per pound in the second quarter of 2005 (see attached presentation, Cathode Cash Unit Costs). Higher unit costs in 2006 primarily reflect the impact of lower volumes.
 
Atlantic Copper reported operating income of $21.8 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared with an operating loss of $0.1 million in the 2005 period. The positive results in the 2006 period primarily reflect higher treatment charges, net of higher costs. Each $0.01 change in treatment and refining charge rates equates to approximately $6 million of Atlantic Copper annual operating income.
 
PT Smelting, PT-FIs 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit, treated 187,500 metric tons of concentrates in the second quarter of 2006, compared with 230,700 metric tons in the year-ago period. PT Smelting completed a 22-day maintenance turnaround in the second quarter of 2006 which resulted in lower production during the period. PT Smelting is currently expanding its production capacity from 250,000 metric tons of copper metal per year to 270,000 metric tons of copper metal per year. PT Smelting produced 127.3 million pounds of cathodes for the second
 
5
quarter of 2006, compared with cathode production of 146.1 million pounds during the second quarter of 2005. PT Smeltings cathode cash unit cost per pound totaled $0.25 per pound in the second quarter of 2006 and $0.10 per pound in the year-ago period (see attached presentation, Cathode Cash Unit Costs), primarily reflecting the impact of the maintenance turnaround discussed above and higher energy costs in 2006. PT-FIs equity interest in PT Smeltings earnings totaled $2.0 million, $1.6 million to net income or $0.01 per share, in the second quarter of 2006 compared to $2.6 million, $2.1 million to net income or $0.01 per share, in the 2005 quarter.
 
FCX defers recognition of profits on PT-FIs sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FIs sales to PT Smelting until the final sales to third parties occur. Changes in these net deferrals resulted in an addition to FCXs net income totaling $18.1 million, $0.08 per share, in the second quarter of 2006, compared with an addition of $25.7 million, $0.12 per share, in the second quarter of 2005, and an addition of $57.4 million, $0.26 per share, in the first six months of 2006, compared with a reduction of $8.5 million, $0.04 per share, in the first six months of 2005. At June 30, 2006, FCXs net deferred profits on PT-FI concentrate inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods net income after taxes and minority interests sharing totaled $60.5 million. Based on copper prices of $3.00 per pound and gold prices of $600 per ounce for the third quarter of 2006 and current shipping schedules, FCX estimates that the net change in deferred profits on intercompany sales will result in a decrease to net income of approximately $10 million in the third quarter of 2006. The actual change in deferred intercompany profits may differ substantially from this estimate because of changes in the timing of shipments to affiliated smelters and metal prices.
 
EXPLORATION and MINE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
PT-FIs exploration efforts in 2006 are focused on testing extensions of the Deep Grasberg and Kucing Liar mine complex, the resource potential below the previously mined Ertsberg deposit and other targets in Block A of its Contract of Work, the existing producing area of the Grasberg minerals district. FCX continues to assess the timing of resumption of suspended exploration activities in prospective areas outside Block A.
 
In 2004, PT-FI commenced its Common Infrastructure project, which will provide access to its large undeveloped underground ore bodies located in the Grasberg minerals district through a tunnel system located approximately 400 meters deeper than its existing underground tunnel system. In addition to providing access to its underground ore bodies, the tunnel system will enable PT-FI to conduct future exploration in prospective areas associated with its currently identified ore bodies. Development of the Common Infrastructure project is progressing according to plan.
 
PT-FI is also developing the Big Gossan underground mine, a high-grade deposit located near the existing milling complex. The engineering design for Big Gossan includes 53 million metric tons of ore, grading 2.3 percent copper and 1.1 g/t of gold, expected to yield aggregate recoverable copper of 2.5 billion pounds and aggregate recoverable gold of 1.2 million ounces. Aggregate capital expenditures for Big Gossan to be incurred over a four-year period beginning in 2005 total approximately $225 million, $195 million net to PT-FI, with a ramp-up to full production of 7,000 metric tons per day by 2010 (average annual aggregate incremental production approximating 135 million pounds of copper and 65,000 ounces of gold, with PT-FI receiving 60 percent of these amounts).
 
As discussed above, PT-FI is expanding the DOZ underground mine to 50,000 metric tons per day from the current capacity of 35,000 metric tons per day. The 50,000 metric tons per day expansion is on track for completion in mid-2007. PT-FI anticipates expanding this mine further to 80,000 metric tons of ore per day.
 
CASH FLOWS and DEBT REDUCTIONS
FCX generated operating cash flows totaling $499.7 million during the second quarter of 2006 and $375.9 million for the first half of 2006. Operating cash flows for the first six months of 2006 were reduced by $519.2 million used for working capital requirements, including $328.4 million
 
6
for income tax payments attributable to earnings in 2005. Capital expenditures totaled $58.2 million for the second quarter of 2006 and $110.3 million for the first half of 2006. FCXs capital expenditures for 2006 are currently estimated to approximate $250 million.
 
Using estimated sales volumes for the remainder of 2006 and assuming average prices of $3.00 per pound of copper and $600 per ounce of gold for the remainder of 2006, FCX would generate operating cash flows approximating $1.6 billion in 2006, with over $1.2 billion in the second half of the year. In the balance of the year, each $0.10 per pound change in copper prices would affect 2006 cash flows by approximately $38 million and each $25 per ounce change in gold prices would affect 2006 cash flows by approximately $12 million.
 
Total debt as of June 30, 2006 approximated $1.1 billion, $714.1 million net of $357.8 million of cash. Total debt was reduced by $184.1 million in the first half of 2006, including $167.4 million for the mandatory redemption of FCXs Gold-Denominated Preferred Stock, Series II in the first quarter for $236.4 million, resulting in a $69.0 million loss recognized in revenues ($36.6 million to net income or $0.17 per share) for the first six months of 2006. Other debt reductions in the first half of 2006 included privately negotiated transactions to induce conversion of $16.0 million of 7% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 into 0.5 million shares of FCX common stock and purchases in open market transactions of $11.5 million of 10% Senior Notes due 2010 for $12.6 million. As a result of the induced conversions and open market transactions, FCX recorded charges of $2.2 million ($1.5 million to net income, net of related reduction of interest expense, or $0.01 per share) in the first six months of 2006.
 
Following the debt repayments and redemption during the first half of 2006, FCXs debt maturities for the remainder of 2006 total $92.1 million, including $25.8 million for the final redemption of FCXs mandatorily redeemable silver preferred stock, which will result in a $12.5 million decrease in debt and a reduction of revenues of $13.3 million, $7.0 million to net income, in the third quarter of 2006. Debt maturities total $58.5 million for the three-year period of 2007 through 2009. FCX will continue to consider opportunities to repay debt in advance of scheduled maturities.
 
FCX is completing arrangements to amend its $195 million revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in September 2006. In addition to extending the maturity to 2009, FCX expects to increase the size of the facility to $465 million, which may be expanded to up to $500 million with additional lender commitments.
 
FINANCIAL POLICY
FCX has a long-established tradition of returning substantial cash to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. Based on current mine plans and subject to future copper and gold prices, FCX expects its cash flows to exceed budgeted capital expenditures, which would provide opportunities to reduce debt further and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share purchases.
 
Financial transactions completed during the second quarter of 2006 totaled $328.5 million, including $29.4 million in debt reductions, $199.3 million in common stock dividends ($1.0625 per share) and $99.8 million used to purchase 2.0 million shares of common stock at an average price of $49.94 per share. Dividends included a supplemental dividend of $0.75 per share paid on June 30, 2006. Year-to-date, FCX has completed approximately $636 million in financial transactions, including debt reductions totaling $184.1 million, common stock dividends totaling $352.5 million ($1.875 per share) and $99.8 million in common stock purchases. Since December 2004, FCX has paid six supplemental dividends totaling $551.7 million ($3.00 per share).
 
FCX has purchased a total of 7.8 million shares for $279.5 million (average of $36.05 per share) under its Board authorized 20-million share open market purchase program. As of July 17, 2006, 12.2 million shares remain available for purchase under the program. As of June 30, 2006, FCX had 187.2 million common shares outstanding.
 
7
The potential payment of future regular and supplemental dividends will be determined by FCXs Board of Directors and will be dependent upon many factors, including FCXs cash flows and financial position, copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions. The timing of future purchases of FCXs common stock depends on a number of factors including the price of its common shares, its cash flows and financial position, copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions.
 
FCX explores for, develops, mines and processes ore containing copper, gold and silver in Indonesia, and smelts and refines copper concentrates in Spain and Indonesia. Additional information on FCX is available on our web site,

PT FREEPORT INDONESIA PRODUCT REVENUES AND UNIT NET CASH COSTS
Unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the cash generating capacity of PT Freeport Indonesias mining operations expressed on a basis relating to its primary metal product, copper. PT Freeport Indonesia uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This measure is presented by other copper and gold mining companies, although PT Freeport Indonesias measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
PT Freeport Indonesia presents gross profit per pound of copper using both a by-product method and a co-product method. PT Freeport Indonesia uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (1) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (2) it produces and sells one product, concentrates, which contains copper, gold and silver, (3) it is not possible to specifically assign PT Freeport Indonesias costs to revenues from the copper, gold and silver it produces in concentrates, (4) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (5) it is the method used by PT Freeport Indonesias management and Board of Directors to monitor its operations. In the co-product method presentation below, costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent our metals sales volumes and realized prices change.
In both the by-product and the co-product method calculations below, PT Freeport Indonesia shows adjustments to copper revenues for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because the copper pricing adjustments do not result from current period sales, PT Freeport Indonesia has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and nonrecurring costs, which consist of items such as stock-based compensation costs starting January 1, 2006, write-offs of equipment or unusual charges, have not been material. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs. As discussed above, gold and silver revenues are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. Presentations under both methods are shown below together with a reconciliation to amounts reported in FCXs consolidated financial statements.

Cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper is a measure intended to provide investors with information about the costs incurred to produce cathodes at FCXs smelting operations in Spain and Indonesia. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance at its smelting operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Other smelting companies present this measure, although Atlantic Coppers and PT Smeltings measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
ATLANTIC COPPER CATHODE CASH UNIT COST PER POUND OF COPPER
The reconciliation below presents reported production costs for FCXs smelting and refining segment (Atlantic Copper) and subtracts or adds components of those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. The adjusted production costs amounts are used to calculate Atlantic Coppers cathode cash unit cost per pound of copper (in thousands, except per pound amounts):
PT SMELTING CATHODE CASH UNIT COST PER POUND OF COPPER
The calculation below presents PT Smeltings reported operating costs and subtracts or adds components of those costs that do not directly relate to the process of converting copper concentrates to cathodes. PT Smeltings operating costs are then reconciled to PT Freeport Indonesias equity in PT Smelting earnings reported in FCXs consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except per pound amounts):

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
PT Freeport Indonesias Contract of Work provides for a 35 percent corporate income tax rate. PT Indocopper Investama (100 percent owned by FCX) pays a 30 percent corporate income tax on dividends it receives from its 9.36 percent ownership in PT Freeport Indonesia. In addition, the tax treaty between Indonesia and the United States (U.S.) provides for a withholding tax rate of 10 percent on dividends and interest that PT Freeport Indonesia and PT Indocopper Investama pay to their parent company, FCX. FCX currently records no income taxes at Atlantic Copper, which is subject to taxation in Spain, because it has not generated significant taxable income in recent years and has substantial tax loss carryforwards for which FCX has provided no net financial statement benefit. FCX receives no consolidated tax benefit from these losses because they cannot be used to offset PT Freeport Indonesias profits in Indonesia, but can be utilized to offset Atlantic Coppers future profits.
Parent company costs consist primarily of interest, depreciation and amortization, and general and administrative expenses. FCX receives minimal, if any, tax benefit from these costs, including interest expense, primarily because the parent company normally generates no taxable income from U.S. sources. As a result, FCXs provision for income taxes as a percentage of its consolidated income before income taxes and minority interests will vary as PT Freeport Indonesias income changes, absent changes in Atlantic Copper and parent company costs. Summaries of the approximate significant components of the calculation of FCXs consolidated provision for income taxes are shown below (in thousands, except percentages).
