NEW ORLEANS, LA, October 31, 2006 - Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a supplemental common stock dividend of $1.50 per share to be paid on December 29, 2006 to shareholders of record as of December 14, 2006. The supplemental dividend to be paid in December represents an addition to FCXs regular quarterly common stock dividend of $0.3125 per share (equivalent to $1.25 per share per annum) payable November 1, 2006. Since the fourth quarter of 2004, FCXs Board has authorized eight supplemental dividends totaling $1.0 billion ($5.25 per share, including $0.25 per share in 2004, $1.50 per share in 2005 and $3.50 per share in 2006). The potential payment of any future supplemental dividends will be determined by FCXs Board of Directors and will be dependent upon many factors, including FCXs cash flows and financial position, copper and gold prices and general economic and market conditions. Based on approximately 197 million shares currently outstanding, the supplemental dividend payment will approximate $296 million.
 
Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, said, The authorization for this supplemental dividend reflects the significant cash flows being generated by our Grasberg operations. This supplemental dividend represents a further step in executing our established financial policy of maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning excess cash to shareholders. Positive market conditions and strong operating performance have allowed us to reduce our total debt by $1.7 billion and fund over $1.5 billion in common stock dividends and open market share purchases since the beginning of 2003 through September 30, 2006. The outlook is positive for our business to continue to generate strong cash flows.
