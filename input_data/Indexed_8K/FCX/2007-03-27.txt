21
action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, (ii) or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     
(b)
Indemnification of the Company.
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed upon that the only such information consists of the following the statements concerning the Underwriters contained in the first and second sentences of the fifth paragraph, the thirteenth paragraph and the fourteenth paragraph, in each case, under the caption "Underwriters".
     
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own
Notice and Procedures.

counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     
(d)
Contribution.
If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one
23
hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Shares and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     
(e)
Limitation on Liability.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by
pro
rata
allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
     
(f)
Non-Exclusive Remedies.
The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

(a) If, on the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Shares by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Shares on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "
Underwriter
" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Shares that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement or, with respect to any Additional Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Shares on any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
25
     
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.

If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation
23
provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Shares and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     
(e)
Limitation on Liability.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by
pro
rata
allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
     
(f)
Non-Exclusive Remedies.
The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement or, with respect to any Additional Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Shares on any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without
25
liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.

(i) in cash;
 
(ii) by delivery of shares of Common Stock; or
 
(iii) through any combination of cash and Common Stock.

(d) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be delivered to Holders in payment or partial payment of a dividend. A cash adjustment shall be paid to each Holder that would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Common Stock.

(iii) At any time when voting rights pursuant to Section 6(a)(i) shall have vested and be continuing in Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock, or if a vacancy shall exist in the office of any such additional director, the Board of Directors may call, and, upon written request of the Holders of record of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, addressed to the chairman of the Board of Directors, shall call a special meeting of the holders of shares of the Voting Rights Class (voting as a single class) for the purpose of electing the directors, that such holders are entitled to elect.

(v) Any director elected pursuant to the voting rights created under this Section 6(a) shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders (unless such term has previously terminated pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii)) and any vacancy in respect of any such director shall be filled only by vote of the remaining
11
director so elected by holders of the Voting Rights Class, or if there be no such remaining director, by the holders of shares of the Voting Rights Class at a special meeting called in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6(a), or, if no such special meeting is called, at the next annual meeting of shareholders. Upon any termination of such voting rights, the term of office of all directors elected pursuant to this Section 6(a) shall terminate.

provided
,
however
, that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time.

(b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of any mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 8 hereof or a conversion at the option of the Holder pursuant to Section 9 or Section 10 hereof, the Corporation shall pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest Cent) equal to the same fraction of:
 
(i) in the case of a conversion pursuant to Section 8 or a Cash Acquisition Conversion pursuant to Section 10, the average of the Daily Closing price on each of the five consecutive Trading Days preceding the Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date; or
 
(ii) in the case of an Early Conversion pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Daily Closing Price of the Common Stock determined as of the second Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date.
 
(c) If more than one share of the Convertible Preferred Stock is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock so surrendered.
 
(14)
Anti-Dilution Adjustments to the Fixed Conversion Rates.
 (
a)
Each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be subject to the following adjustments:
19
(i)
Stock Dividends and Distributions
. In case the Corporation shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution, shall be increased by dividing such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this sub-section (i), the number of shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Corporation shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Corporation.
 
(ii)
Subdivisions, Splits and Combinations of the Common Stock
. In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective.
 
(iii)
Issuance of Stock Purchase Rights
. In case the Corporation shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of Common Stock (other than rights or warrants issued pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan or other similar plans), entitling such holders, for a period of up to 45 days from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares
20
of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this clause (iii), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Corporation shall not issue any such rights or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Corporation.
 
(iv)
Debt or Asset Distribution.
 
(A)
In case the Corporation shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets (excluding any dividend or distribution referred to in Section 14(a)(i) or Section 14(a)(ii) hereof, any rights or warrants referred to in Section 14(a)(iii) hereof, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation, and any dividend of shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-Off referred to in Section 14(a)(iv)(B) below), each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the rate determined by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock less the then Fair Market Value of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this clause (iv)(A) is applicable, clause (iv)(B) of this Section 14(a) shall not be applicable.
 
(B) In the case of a Spin-Off, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive that distribution shall be adjusted by multiplying each Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock plus the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of capital stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock as of the fifteenth Trading Day after the ex-date with respect to such Spin Off (or, if such shares of capital stock or equity interests are listed on a national or regional securities exchange, the average of the Daily Closing Price of such security on each of the five consecutive Trading Days ending on such fifteenth day) and the denominator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the
21
Common Stock. Any adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this clause (iv)(B) of this Section 14(a) shall occur on the fifteenth Trading Day from, but excluding, the ex-date with respect to the Spin-Off.
 
(v)
Cash Distributions
. In case the Corporation shall distribute cash to all holders of Common Stock immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price of Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price of Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination minus the amount per share of such dividend or distribution;
provided
, that no adjustment shall be made to either Fixed Conversion Rate for (i) any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 14(e) applies or as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (iv) of this Section 14(a), (ii) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (iii) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation or (iv) any cash dividends on the Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed $0.3125 in any fiscal quarter (the 
Dividend Threshold Amount
). The Dividend Threshold Amount is subject to an inversely proportional adjustment whenever the Fixed Conversion Rates are adjusted,
provided
that no adjustment shall be made to the Dividend Threshold Amount for any adjustments made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to this Section 14(a)(v).
 
If an adjustment is required to be made under this Section 14(a)(v) as a result of a distribution that is a regularly scheduled dividend, the amount per share of such dividend or distribution for purposes of determining the denominator in this Section 14(a)(v) shall be deemed to be the amount by which the distribution exceeds the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount. If an adjustment is required to be made under this clause as a result of a distribution that is not a regularly scheduled dividend, the amount per share of such dividend or distribution for purposes of determining the denominator in this Section 14(a)(v) shall be deemed to be the full amount of such distribution.
 
(vi)
Self Tender Offers and Exchange Offers
. In case a tender or exchange offer made by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to shareholders (based on the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares (as defined below in this Section)) of an aggregate consideration per share of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value that, together with (a) any cash and other consideration payable in a tender or
22
exchange offer by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation for shares of Common Stock expiring during the preceding 12-month period in respect of which no previous adjustments pursuant to this Section 14 have been made,
plus
(b) the aggregate amount of any cash distributions referred to in Section 14(a)(v) to holders of Common Stock during the preceding 12-month period in respect of which no adjustments have been made pursuant to this Section 14, exceeds 15% of the Corporations market capitalization as of the expiration of such tender offer or exchange offer (the 
Expiration Time
), then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the eighth Trading Day after the date of the Expiration Time, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing such Fixed Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the eighth Trading Day after the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the seventh Trading Day after the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any shares validly tendered and not withdrawn) at the Expiration Time less (y) the amount of cash plus the Fair Market Value of the aggregate consideration payable to holders of Common Stock in the tender or exchange offer and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the seventh Trading Day after the Expiration Time and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any shares validly tendered and not withdrawn) as of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the 
Purchased Shares
).
 
(vii)
Rights Plans
. To the extent that the Corporation has a rights plan in effect with respect to the Common Stock on any Conversion Date, upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock, Holders shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation of such rights as if the Corporation made a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock as described in clause (iv) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
 
(b)
Adjustment for Tax Reasons.
The Corporation may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 14, if the Board of Directors deems it advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of the Corporations shares (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons;
provided
that the same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate.
 
(c)
Calculation of Adjustments; Adjustments to Threshold Appreciation Price, Initial Price and Cash Acquisition Stock Price.
(
i)
All adjustments to each
23
Fixed Conversion Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share (or, if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share) of Common Stock. Prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, no adjustment in the Fixed Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein;
provided
, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment;
provided
,
further
that with respect to adjustments to be made to the Fixed Conversion Rates in connection with cash dividends paid by the Corporation, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be adjusted regardless of whether such aggregate adjustments amount to one percent or more of the Fixed Conversion Rates no later than August 1 of each calendar year;
provided
,
further
that on the earlier of the Mandatory Conversion Date and the date on which the Corporation consummates a Cash Acquisition, adjustments to each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be made with respect to any such adjustment carried forward and which has not been taken into account before such date. If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v), 14(a)(vi) or 14(b), an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made to the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of determining which of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 8(b) shall apply on the Conversion Date. Such adjustment shall be made by dividing each of the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be either Fixed Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v), 14(a)(vi) or 14(b) and the denominator of which shall be such Fixed Conversion Rate immediately before such adjustment;
provided
, that if such adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v) or 14(a)(vi) or 14(b) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Fixed Conversion Rates.
 
(ii) If an adjustment is made to the Minimum Conversion Rate pursuant to Sections 14(a)(i), 14(a)(ii), 14(a)(iii), 14(a)(iv), 14(a)(v), 14(a)(vi) or 14(b), a proportional adjustment shall be made to each Cash Acquisition Stock Price column heading set forth in the table included in the definition of Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying each Cash Acquisition Stock Price included in such table by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment.
 
(iii) No adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates need be made if Holders may participate, upon conversion (and based on the applicable Conversion Rate related to such conversion), in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment; provided, that if the distributed assets or securities that the Holders would receive upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as applicable, such assets or securities are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as applicable, without any loss of rights or privileges for a period of at least 45 days following conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock. The applicable Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:
24
(A) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Corporations securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
 
(B) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock or rights or warrants to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries;
 
(C) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock were first issued;
 
(D) for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock; or
 
(E) for accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends.
 
(iv) The Corporation shall have the power to resolve any ambiguity or correct any error in this Section 14 and its action in so doing, as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors, or a duly authorized committee thereof, shall be final and conclusive.
 
(d)
Notice of Adjustment.
Whenever a Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, is to be adjusted, the Corporation shall: (i) compute such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, and prepare and transmit to the Transfer Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to a Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, (or if the Corporation is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock of the occurrence of such event and (iii) as soon as practicable following the determination of a revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, provide, or cause to be provided, to the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rate or the Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable, was determined and setting forth such revised Fixed Conversion Rate or Cash Acquisition Conversion Rate, as applicable.
 
(e)
Reorganization Events.
In the event of:
25
 
(i) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Corporation is the continuing corporation and in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation is not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Corporation or another Person);
 
(ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation;
 
(iii) any reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock; or
 
(iv) any statutory exchange of securities of the Corporation with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition) (any such event specified in this Section 14(e), a 
Reorganization Event
);
 
each share of Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, after such Reorganization Event, be convertible into the kind of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon and without any right to dividends or distribution thereon which have a record date that is prior to the Conversion Date) per share of Common Stock (the 
Exchange Property
) by a holder of Common Stock that exercised his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event and in respect of which such rights of election shall have been exercised (
Electing Share
), then, for the purpose of this Section 14(e) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each Electing Share shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the kinds and amounts so receivable per share by the Electing Shares). The amount of Exchange Property receivable upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 8 or 9 hereof shall be determined based upon the Conversion Rate in effect on such Conversion Date. The applicable Conversion Rate shall be (x) the Minimum Conversion Rate, in the case of an Early Conversion Date and (y) determined based upon the definition of Conversion Rate set forth in Section 8 and the Applicable Market Value at such time, in the case of the Mandatory Conversion Date.
 
For purposes of this Section 14(e), 
Applicable Market Value
 shall be deemed to refer to the Applicable Market Value of the Exchange Property and such value shall be determined (A) with respect to any publicly traded securities that compose all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the Daily Closing Price of such securities, (B) in the case of any cash that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the amount of such cash and (C) in the case of any other property that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the value of such property, as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Corporation for this purpose. For purposes of this Section 14(e), the term 
Daily Closing Price
 shall
26
be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. For purposes of this Section 14(e), references to Common Stock in the definition of 
Trading Day
 shall be replaced by references to any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property.
 
The above provisions of this Section 14(e) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 14 shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (or any successor) received by the holders of Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.
 
The Corporation (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitute the Exchange Property. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 14(e).
 
(15)
Replacement Stock Certificates.
 (
a)
If physical certificates are issued, and any of the Convertible Preferred Stock certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Corporation shall, at the expense of the Holder, issue, in exchange and in substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Convertible Preferred Stock certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the Convertible Preferred Stock certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new Convertible Preferred Stock certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent amount of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, but only upon receipt of evidence of such loss, theft or destruction of such Convertible Preferred Stock certificate and indemnity, if requested, satisfactory to the Corporation and the Transfer Agent.
 
(b) The Corporation is not required to issue any certificates representing the Convertible Preferred Stock on or after the Mandatory Conversion Date. In lieu of the delivery of a replacement certificate following the Mandatory Conversion Date, the Transfer Agent, upon delivery of the evidence and indemnity described above, shall deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Preferred Stock formerly evidenced by the certificate.
 
(16)
Transfer Agent, Registrar, Redemption, Conversion and Dividend Disbursing Agent.
The duly appointed Transfer Agent, Registrar, Redemption, Conversion and Dividend Disbursing Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock shall be Mellon Investor Services LLC. The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, remove the Transfer Agent in accordance with the agreement between the Corporation and the Transfer Agent;
provided
that the Corporation shall appoint a successor transfer agent who shall accept such appointment prior to the effectiveness of such removal. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Corporation shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
(17)

 (
a)

28
of the Person or Person specified by the Depositary in a written instrument to the Registrar.

(iii)
A Global Preferred Share shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Transfer
Agent manually countersigns such Global Preferred Share. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that such Global Preferred Share has been authenticated under this Certificate. Each Global Preferred Share shall be dated the date of its authentication.
