Meeting of Stockholders
1.
 
Meetings of the stockholders shall be held at the registered office of the corporation in the State of Delaware, or at such other place as shall be determined, from time to time, by the Board of Directors.
 
 
 
 
2.
 
The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on such day at such time as may be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. At each annual meeting of the stockholders they shall elect by a majority of the votes cast, by written ballot, and subject to the voting powers set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation, the successors of the directors whose term expires at such meeting, to hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders held in the year following their election and until their successors are respectively elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by plurality vote. In an uncontested election, any nominee for director who has a majority of votes cast withheld from his or her election shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board shall act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees recommendation and publicly disclose its decision within 90 days from the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. Any director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees recommendation or the Board action regarding whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. If each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee fails to be elected at the same election, the independent directors who were elected shall appoint a committee to consider the tendered resignations and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject them. Any vacancies in the Board resulting from the failed election of a director under this section may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, and each director so elected shall hold office until his or her successor has been elected and duly qualified. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.
3.
 
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws. If, however, such majority shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice other than announcement at the meeting (except as otherwise provided by statute), until the requisite amount of voting stock shall be present. At such adjourned meeting at which the requisite amount of voting stock shall be represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.
4.
 
At all meetings of the stockholders, each stockholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder and bearing a date not more than six months prior to said meeting, unless such instrument provides for a longer period. All proxies shall be filed with the secretary of the meeting before being voted.
5.
 
At each meeting of the stockholders each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock having voting power, registered in his name on the books of the corporation at the record date fixed in accordance with these By-Laws, or otherwise determined, with respect to such meeting. Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, by the

Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, all matters coming before any meeting of the stockholders shall be decided by the vote of a majority of the number of shares of stock present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat, a quorum being present.

Such notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
7.
 
Subject to such rights to call special meetings of stockholders under specified circumstances as may be granted to holders of any shares of Preferred Stock of the corporation pursuant to the provisions of Section (c) of Article FOURTH of the Certificate of Incorporation, special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board or the President of the corporation, or at the request in writing or by a vote of a majority of the Board of Directors, and not by any other persons. Any request for a special meeting made by the Board of Directors shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.
8.
 
Business transacted at each special meeting shall be confined to the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of such meeting.
9.
 
The order of business at each meeting of the stockholders shall be determined by the chairman of such meeting.

At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of the corporation who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 10. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 210th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 90 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (c) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder and (d) any material

Notwithstanding anything in the By-Laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 10. The chairman of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of the By-Laws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10, a stockholder seeking to have a proposal included in the corporation's proxy statement shall comply with the requirements of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including, but not limited to, Rule 14a-8 or its successor provision).
11.

In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of such stockholder and (ii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such stockholder. At the request of the Board of Directors any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in a stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in the By-Laws. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the By-Laws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
