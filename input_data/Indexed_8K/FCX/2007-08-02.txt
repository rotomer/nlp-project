Item 8.01.  
Other Events.
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.s (FCX) acquisition of Phelps Dodge Corporation (Phelps Dodge) is deemed under Peruvian law to be an indirect acquisition by FCX of over 50% of the voting shares of Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A. (SMCV), a publicly-traded Peruvian entity in which Phelps Dodge owns 53.56%.  Pursuant to applicable Peruvian regulations, FCX is required to conduct a tender for 24.87% of the minority interest in SMCV.  Accordingly, on August 1, 2007, a subsidiary of FCX submitted a tender offer for these shares.  Certain minority holders have waived their rights to participate in the tender offer and after taking this into account, the shares remaining for purchase total 6.94% of the SMCV shares (24.3 million shares).  The offering price of $14.40 per share of SMCV was determined by an independent appraiser appointed by Peruvian regulators.  FCX does not expect holders to tender their shares because the offer of $14.40 per share is below the recent trading price of SMCV of $26 to $30 per share.  The tender offer will remain open for 20 business days.
   
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
