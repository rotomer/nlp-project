PHOENIX, AZ, January 21, 2010  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported fourth-quarter 2009 net income attributable to common stock of $971 million, $2.15 per share, compared with a net loss of $13.9 billion, $36.78 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2008.  After adjusting for special items totaling $14.0 billion, $36.84 per share, fourth-quarter 2008 adjusted net income totaled $23 million, $0.06 per share (see page XXVIII of the supplemental schedules, which are available on FCX's web site, www.fcx.com, for a reconciliation of net loss attributable to common stock to adjusted net income).  For the year ended December 31, 2009, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $2.5 billion, $5.86 per share, compared with a net loss of $11.3 billion, $29.72 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2008.
 
James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, Our 2009 results reflect exceptional operating performance throughout our operations, successful execution of our production and cost reduction plans and improved market conditions for our products  copper, gold and molybdenum.  We commend our entire team for their extraordinary accomplishments during the year.  We are in a strong position to continue to deliver value to shareholders through our existing asset base and the opportunities provided through our exploration and development activities.  We will continue to use our cash flows to strengthen our balance sheet, invest in growth projects and provide cash returns to our shareholders.
 
SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA

OPERATIONS
 
  Fourth-quarter 2009 consolidated copper sales of 989 million pounds were higher than the October 2009 estimate of 915 million pounds but lower than fourth-quarter 2008 copper sales of 1.2 billion pounds.  The favorable variance to the October 2009 estimate primarily reflects accelerated mining of a section in the Grasberg open pit previously forecast to be mined in future periods.  The variance to the 2008 period primarily reflects anticipated lower copper ore grades at Grasberg and production curtailments in North America.
Consolidated.
 
Fourth-quarter 2009 consolidated gold sales of 551 thousand ounces were higher than the October 2009 estimate of 425 thousand ounces and the fourth-quarter 2008 gold sales of 462 thousand ounces, reflecting accelerated mining of a section with higher gold ore grades in the Grasberg open pit.
 
Consolidated molybdenum sales of 16 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2009 were higher than fourth-quarter 2008 sales of 12 million pounds and the October 2009 estimate of 14 million pounds because of improved molybdenum sales to Asia.
 
Consolidated unit site production and delivery costs, excluding Tenke Fungurume, averaged $1.25 per pound of copper in the fourth quarter of 2009, nine percent lower than fourth-quarter 2008 unit costs of $1.37 per pound.  Fourth-quarter 2009 unit net cash costs, after by-product credits, of $0.62 per pound were significantly lower than the $1.04 per pound in the year-ago period.  The improved unit net cash cost performance primarily reflects higher gold credits, reduced operating rates at North America copper mines to suspend production of high-cost incremental volumes and achievement of cost savings initiatives and operating efficiencies, partly offset by lower copper volumes at Grasberg.

Assuming average prices of $3.25 per pound for copper, $1,100 per ounce for gold and $12 per pound for molybdenum, current sales estimates and estimates for commodity-based input costs, unit net cash costs, excluding Tenke Fungurume, are expected to average approximately $0.86 per pound for the year 2010.  Because of the impact of projected lower 2010 copper and gold sales volumes from Grasberg and recent increases in commodity-based input costs and foreign currencies, average unit net cash costs for 2010 are expected to be higher than 2009 unit net cash costs.  FCX will incorporate Tenke Fungurume in its consolidated unit net cash cost disclosures upon completion of ramp-up activities, expected during 2010.
 
  FCX operates six open-pit copper mines in North America (Morenci, Sierrita, Bagdad, Safford and Miami in Arizona and Tyrone in New Mexico).  By-product molybdenum is produced primarily at Sierrita and Bagdad.  All of the North America mining operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci.  FCX records its 85 percent joint venture interest in Morenci using the proportionate consolidation method.
North America Copper Mines.
 
 
 
 
Consolidated copper sales in North America totaled 302 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2009, 22 percent lower than fourth-quarter 2008 sales.  FCX continues to operate at reduced rates at certain of its North America copper mines in response to reduced demand for copper in the western world.
 
For the year 2010, FCX expects sales from North America copper mines to approximate 1.0 billion pounds of copper, compared with 1.2 billion pounds of copper for 2009 reflecting impacts of reduced 2009 mining activities on 2010 leaching operations.  By-product molybdenum production is expected to approximate 30 million pounds in 2010, compared with 25 million pounds in 2009.
 
North America unit site production and delivery costs were lower in the 2009 periods (decreases of 37 percent for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 34 percent for the year 2009), compared with the 2008 periods primarily because of cost reduction and efficiency efforts, including the impact of lower operating rates and reduced input costs, primarily for energy.  The year 2009 decrease was partly offset by changes in inventory, reflecting the impact of historical higher cost production on inventory carrying values.  Molybdenum by-product credits were significantly lower in the 2009 periods, compared with the 2008 periods primarily because of lower molybdenum prices and lower sales volumes.
 
Based on current operating plans and assuming achievement of current sales estimates, an average molybdenum price of $12 per pound for 2010 and estimates for commodity-based input costs, FCX estimates that average unit net cash costs, including molybdenum credits, for its North America copper mines would approximate $1.23 per pound of copper for the year 2010.  Unit net cash costs for

2010 would change by approximately $0.02 per pound for each $1 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum for 2010.  Unit net cash costs for the year 2010 are expected to be slightly higher than unit net cash costs of $1.11 per pound of copper for the year 2009 primarily because of higher input costs and lower volumes, partly offset by higher molybdenum credits.
 
  In the fourth quarter of 2009, FCX initiated plans to restart copper production at the Miami mine in Arizona, which will improve efficiencies of ongoing reclamation projects associated with historical mining operations at the site.  During the approximate five-year mine life, FCX expects to ramp up production to approximately 100 million pounds of copper per year by the second half of 2011.  FCX is investing $40 million in this project, which will benefit from the use of existing mining equipment.  This project was deferred in late 2008 in response to market conditions.  In addition, FCX is initiating activities to restart the Morenci mill to process available sulfide material currently being mined.  The mill was shut down in February 2009 in response to market conditions.  Mill throughput is initially expected to approximate 30,000 metric tons of ore per day, which is approximately 60 percent of total mill capacity; and copper concentrate production is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2010.  Mining operations at Morenci remain at reduced rates and the timing of increasing mining rates will continue to be assessed as market conditions warrant.  Operating plans at the other North American sites continue to be reviewed and adjustments will be made in response to changes in market conditions.
Development Activities.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2009, FCX purchased property adjacent to its Sierrita operations from Twin Buttes Properties, Inc. for $200 million.  The property includes the Twin Buttes copper mine, which ceased operations in 1994, and contains mineralized material of approximately 0.7 billion metric tons with average grades of 0.43 percent for copper and 0.024 percent for molybdenum.  The purchase provides significant synergies in the Sierrita district, including the potential for expanded mining activities and access to material that can be used for Sierrita tailings and stockpile reclamation purposes.  FCX plans to conduct studies to incorporate the Twin Buttes resources in future plans to determine the optimum development plans for the district.
 
  FCX operates four copper mines in South America  Cerro Verde in Peru and Candelaria, Ojos del Salado and El Abra in Chile.  FCX owns a 53.56 percent interest in Cerro Verde, an open-pit mine currently producing both electrowon copper cathodes and copper concentrates.  FCX owns 80 percent of the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mining complexes, which include the Candelaria open-pit and underground mines and the Ojos del Salado underground mines.  These mines use common processing facilities to produce copper concentrates.  FCX owns a 51 percent interest in El Abra, an open-pit mine producing electrowon copper cathodes.  All operations in South America are consolidated in FCXs financial statements.
South America Copper Mines.
 
 
5
 
 
 
Consolidated copper sales in South America totaled 354 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2009, 11 percent lower than fourth-quarter 2008 sales, primarily reflecting lower ore grades at Candelaria and downtime for mill maintenance at Cerro Verde.
 
For the year 2010, FCX expects South America sales of 1.3 billion pounds of copper and 100 thousand ounces of gold, compared with 1.4 billion pounds of copper and 90 thousand ounces of gold for 2009.  Projected sales volumes for 2010 are lower than 2009 primarily because of the impact of anticipated lower ore grades at El Abra.
 
South America unit site production and delivery costs were higher in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily because of lower sales volumes.  South America unit site production and delivery costs were slightly lower in the year 2009, compared with the year 2008 primarily because of lower input costs, primarily for energy.  Treatment charges were higher in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily because of the impact of declining copper prices in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
Assuming achievement of current sales estimates and estimates for commodity-based input costs, FCX estimates that average unit net cash costs, including gold credits, for its South America copper mines would approximate $1.20 per pound of copper for the year 2010.  Unit net cash costs for the year 2010 are expected to be higher than unit net cash costs of $1.12 per pound of copper for the year 2009 primarily because of lower volumes and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partly offset by lower sulphuric acid costs.
 
  FCX has resumed construction activities associated with the development of the sulfide ore deposit at El Abra.  The project, which was deferred as a result of market conditions at the end of 2008, involves the development of a large sulfide deposit that will extend the mine life by over ten years.  Production from the sulfide ore, which will be ramping up to approximately 300 million pounds of copper per year, is expected to begin in 2012 and will replace the current oxide copper production that is expected to decline over the next several years.  The project will use a portion of the existing facilities to process the additional sulfide ore.  The capital investment for this project is expected to total $700 million through 2015, including $500 million for the initial phase of the project that is expected to be completed in 2012.  Capital cost estimates have been updated to incorporate recent foreign currency exchange rates and other cost increases.
Development Activities.
 
FCX has also commenced a project to optimize throughput at the existing Cerro Verde concentrator operations.  The project, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2010, is expected to increase mill throughput from 108,000 metric tons of ore per day to 120,000 metric tons per day, resulting in incremental annual production of approximately 30 million pounds of copper.  The capital investment for this project is expected to total approximately $50 million.  FCX continues to assess the potential for a major expansion at Cerro Verde.
 
  Through its 90.64 percent owned and wholly consolidated subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), FCX operates the worlds largest copper and gold mine in terms of reserves at its Grasberg operations in Papua, Indonesia.
Indonesia Mining.
 
6
 
 
 
Indonesia reported lower copper sales and higher gold sales in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of mining of a section with anticipated lower copper ore grades and higher gold ore grades in the Grasberg open pit.  Fourth-quarter 2009 gold sales were also higher, compared to the October 2009 estimate because of the accelerated mining of a section with high gold ore grades previously scheduled to be mined in future periods.  At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing in mining areas with varying ore grades causes fluctuations in the timing of ore production, resulting in fluctuations in quarterly and annual sales of copper and gold.
 
FCX expects Indonesia sales of 1.2 billion pounds of copper and 1.7 million ounces of gold for the year 2010, compared with 1.4 billion pounds of copper and 2.5 million ounces of gold for 2009 as PT-FI is transitioning to a lower grade section of the Grasberg open pit in 2010.  Anticipated changes in ore grades throughout the year are expected to result in variability in quarterly volumes.  Approximately 60 percent of PT-FIs copper and gold production is expected in the second half of 2010.
 
PT-FIs unit net cash (credits) costs, including gold and silver credits, averaged a net credit of $0.67 per pound of copper for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with a net cost of $0.55 per pound for the fourth quarter of 2008, and averaged a net credit of $0.49 per pound of copper for the year 2009, compared with a net cost of $0.96 per pound for the year 2008.  The lower unit net cash costs in the 2009 periods primarily reflected higher gold volumes and prices.  Fourth-quarter 2009 unit site production and delivery costs of $1.36 per pound of copper were higher, compared to $1.16 per pound for the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily because of lower copper volumes for the fourth quarter of 2009.  The lower unit site production and delivery costs for the year 2009 compared to the year 2008 reflected significantly higher copper volumes and lower commodity-based input costs for the year 2009.  Unit site production and delivery costs will vary with fluctuations in production volumes because of the primarily fixed nature of PT-FIs cost structure.
 
Assuming achievement of current 2010 sales estimates, average gold prices of $1,100 per ounce for the year 2010 and current estimates for energy costs, currency exchange rates and other cost factors, FCX expects PT-FIs average unit net cash costs per pound to approximate a net cost of $0.21 per pound for the year 2010.  Unit net cash costs for the year 2010 are expected to be higher than unit net cash costs for the year 2009 primarily because of lower projected sales volumes and higher commodity-based input costs.  Unit net cash costs for 2010 would change by approximately $0.07 per pound for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold for 2010.  Quarterly unit net cash costs will vary significantly with variations in quarterly metal sales volumes.

  FCX holds an effective 57.75 percent interest in the Tenke Fungurume copper and cobalt mining concessions in the Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is the operator of the project.  Construction activities on the $2.0 billion initial project are complete.  Production of copper cathode commenced in March 2009 and achieved targeted rates in September 2009.  During the fourth quarter of 2009, copper production and sales totaled 64 million pounds.  The cobalt plant and sulphuric acid plant were commissioned in the third quarter of 2009.  Tenke Fungurume continues to address start-up and quality issues in the cobalt circuit and expects to reach sustained target rates during 2010.  The current operations are designed to produce 250 million pounds of copper and 18 million pounds of cobalt per year.  The following table presents Tenke Fungurumes operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2009:
Africa Mining.
 
The high grades of copper and cobalt in the ore at Tenke Fungurume are expected to result in an attractive cost structure once the full operation reaches design capacity.  Upon reaching design capacity in the copper and cobalt circuits and assuming average cobalt prices of $10 per pound, average unit net cash costs are targeted to be $0.50 per pound of copper.  Each $2 per pound change in average prices of cobalt would impact unit net cash costs by approximately $0.12 per pound of copper.  Costs in the initial operations will be higher as start-up issues are addressed.  FCX will incorporate Tenke Fungurume in its unit net cash cost disclosures upon completion of ramp-up activities, expected during 2010.
 
The initial Tenke Fungurume project was designed and constructed in a world-class fashion, using modern technology and following international standards for environmental management, occupational safety and social responsibility.  The facilities include impermeable lined tailing storage and waste-water treatment ponds, the first of their kind in the region.  FCX has made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country, including upgrading a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems.  FCXs social and community development programs include development of local micro-enterprise businesses, agricultural capacity-building initiatives, malaria abatement programs, additional potable water wells, new medical facilities and several new schools.  The project will continue to provide important benefits to the Congolese through employment and the provision of local services and to the DRC government through substantial tax, royalty and dividend payments.
 
FCX continues to engage in drilling activities, exploration analyses and metallurgical testing to evaluate the potential of the highly prospective district at Tenke Fungurume and expects its ore reserves to increase significantly over time.  These analyses are being incorporated in future plans to evaluate opportunities for expansion.  In its preliminary recoverable proven and probable reserve estimates for 2009, FCX was successful in adding 2.6 billion pounds of copper reserves and 0.08 billion pounds of cobalt reserves.  Preliminary recoverable proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2009, approximate 135 million metric tons with average grades of 3.13 percent for copper and 0.33 percent for cobalt, which equates to recoverable reserves of 8.4 billion pounds of copper and 0.78 billion pounds of cobalt.
 
FCX expects Tenke Fungurume sales of 240 million pounds of copper and over 20 million pounds of cobalt for the year 2010, compared with 130 million pounds of copper and 3 million pounds of cobalt for 2009.  FCX commenced a feasibility study in the fourth quarter of 2009 to evaluate a second phase of the project, which would include optimizing the current plant and potentially increasing capacity by approximately 50 percent.  The feasibility study is expected to be completed by mid-year 2010.

FCX is continuing to work cooperatively with the DRC government to resolve the ongoing contract review.  FCX believes its contract is fair and equitable, complies with Congolese law and is enforceable without modification.  The review process has not affected the development schedule or current operations.
 
  FCX is the worlds largest producer of molybdenum.  FCX conducts molybdenum mining operations at its wholly owned Henderson underground mine in Colorado and sells by-product molybdenum primarily from its North America copper mines.
Molybdenum.
 
 
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2009, consolidated molybdenum sales from the Henderson mine and by-product mines totaled 16 million pounds, 33 percent higher than fourth-quarter 2008 sales.  Molybdenum markets were significantly affected beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 by the downturn in global economic conditions, requiring FCX to operate its Henderson mine at reduced rates.  Conditions improved somewhat during 2009 and Henderson is currently operating at 80 percent capacity, compared with 60 percent capacity during most of 2009.  In September 2009, FCX restarted the molybdenum circuit at the Cerro Verde mine, which produced two million pounds of molybdenum in 2009 and three million pounds in 2008.  FCX will continue to review and adjust its operating plans to reflect market conditions.  FCX will also continue to monitor market conditions to determine the timing for restarting construction of the Climax molybdenum project, which was suspended in October 2008 in response to market conditions.  The Climax mine would have an annual capacity of 30 million pounds with expansion options.  Once a decision is made to resume construction activities, the project could be completed within 18 months.  The estimated remaining costs for the $550 million project approximate $350 million.
 
For the year 2010, FCX expects molybdenum sales from its mines to approximate 60 million pounds, compared with 58 million pounds in 2009.  The weekly average Molybdenum Dealer Oxide price as of January 20, 2010, was $15 per pound.
Metals Week
 
Unit net cash costs at the Henderson primary molybdenum mine were lower in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily because of cost reduction efforts, partly offset by lower volumes.  Unit net cash costs were slightly higher in the year 2009, compared with 2008 primarily because of lower volumes.  Assuming achievement of current 2010 sales estimates, FCX estimates 2010 average unit net cash costs for its Henderson mine will approximate $5.50 per pound of molybdenum.
 
 
PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES
 
FCXs estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves include 104.2 billion pounds of copper, 37.2 million ounces of gold, 2.59 billion pounds of molybdenum, 270.4 million ounces of silver and 0.78 billion pounds of cobalt.  Estimated recoverable reserves at December 31, 2009, were
 
9
 
 
determined using long-term average prices of $1.60 per pound for copper, $550 per ounce for gold and $8.00 per pound for molybdenum.
 
 
 
 
Net additions to recoverable copper reserves totaled approximately 6.3 billion pounds, including additions of 1.6 billion pounds at the North America mines, 3.0 billion pounds at the Cerro Verde mine in South America and 2.6 billion pounds at Tenke Fungurume.  In addition to the exploration activities in 2009, the additions reflect analysis of the exploratory data gained through core drilling undertaken in 2007 and 2008.  The increases in reserves replaced approximately 150 percent of FCXs 2009 copper production and 300 percent of FCXs 2009 molybdenum production.
 
 
EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES
 
FCX is conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves that will support additional future production capacity in the large mineral districts where it currently operates.  Significantly expanded drilling activities during 2007 and 2008 were successful in providing significant reserve additions and in identifying potential additional ore adjacent to existing ore bodies.  Results indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions at Morenci, Sierrita and Bagdad in North America; Cerro Verde in South America and in the Tenke Fungurume district.
 
Exploration spending in 2010 is estimated to approximate $100 million, compared with $72 million in 2009.  Exploration activities will continue to focus on the potential in FCXs existing mineral districts.  FCX continues to analyze exploratory data gained through the core drilling previously undertaken in addition to conducting new activities.

PROVISIONAL PRICING AND OTHER
 
For the year 2009, approximately 54 percent of FCXs mined copper was sold in concentrate, 25 percent as cathode and 21 percent as rod (principally from North America operations).  Under the long-established structure of sales agreements prevalent in the industry, substantially all of FCXs concentrate and cathode sales are provisionally priced at the time of shipment.  The provisional prices are finalized in a contractually specified future period (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted London Metal Exchange (LME) prices.  Because a significant portion of FCXs concentrate and cathode sales in any quarterly period usually remain subject to final pricing, the quarter-end forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenues and the average recorded copper price for the period.
 
At September 30, 2009, 398 million pounds of copper sales at FCXs copper mining operations (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) were provisionally priced at an average of $2.79 per pound.  Higher average copper prices during the fourth quarter of 2009 resulted in favorable adjustments to the September 30, 2009, provisionally priced copper sales increasing fourth-quarter 2009 consolidated revenues by $140 million ($63 million to net income attributable to common stock or $0.13 per share), whereas declining copper prices during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in unfavorable adjustments to the September 30, 2008, provisionally priced copper sales and decreased consolidated revenues by $745 million ($343 million to net loss attributable to common stock or $0.91 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Adjustments to prior year provisionally priced copper sales for the year 2009 resulted in an increase to consolidated revenues of $132 million ($61 million to net income attributable to common stock or $0.13 per share), compared with an increase of $268 million ($114 million to net loss attributable to common stock or $0.30 per share) for the year 2008.
 
LME copper prices averaged $3.01 per pound during the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with FCXs recorded average price of $3.20 per pound.  Approximately 55 percent of FCXs consolidated copper sales during the fourth quarter were provisionally priced at the time of shipment and are subject to final pricing in 2010.  At December 31, 2009, FCX had copper sales of 391 million pounds of copper at its copper mining operations (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) priced at an average of $3.34 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months.  Each $0.05 change in the price from the December 31, 2009, price for provisionally priced sales would have an approximate $13 million effect on FCXs 2010 net income attributable to common stock.  The LME closing settlement price for copper on January 20, 2010, was $3.38 per pound.
 
FCX defers recognizing profits on PT-FIs and its South America sales to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FIs sales to PT Smelting, PT-FIs 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit, until final sales to third parties occur.  Changes in these net deferrals resulted in an addition to FCXs net income attributable to common stock totaling $15 million, $0.03 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a reduction of $109 million, $0.23 per share, for the year 2009.  For the 2008 periods, changes in these net deferrals resulted in reductions to FCXs net loss attributable to common stock of $31 million, $0.08 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $65 million, $0.17 per share, for the year 2008.  At December 31, 2009, FCXs net deferred profits on PT-FI and South America concentrate inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods net income attributable to common stock totaled $137 million.
 
 
CASH FLOWS, CASH, DEBT and EQUITY
 
Operating cash flows totaled $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $4.4 billion, including $770 million in working capital uses, for the year 2009.  Capital expenditures totaled $449 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, including the $200 million property acquisition adjacent to the Sierrita mine, and $1.6 billion for the year 2009.  Capital expenditures for major projects in 2009 totaled $1.0 billion, which primarily included Tenke Fungurume, underground development activities at Grasberg and the above property acquisition.

At December 31, 2009, FCX had consolidated cash of $2.7 billion.  Net of noncontrolling interests share, taxes and other costs, cash available to parent company is $2.2 billion as shown below (in millions):
a.  
Includes cash at FCXs parent and North America mining operations.
 
At December 31, 2009, FCX had $6.3 billion in debt.  FCX had no borrowings and $39 million of letters of credit issued under its revolving credit facilities, resulting in total availability of approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2009.
 
During the year 2009, FCX repaid approximately $1.0 billion of debt, including $150 million of its revolving credit facility and $727 million of its senior debt through redemption and open-market purchases at a cost of $768 million for the senior debt transactions.  Fourth-quarter 2009 debt repayments included $196 million of senior notes through open-market purchases at a cost of $210 million.  Annual interest cost savings associated with the year 2009 senior note transactions approximate $56 million.  Losses on early extinguishments of debt totaled $17 million ($15 million to net income attributable to common stock or $0.03 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $48 million ($43 million to net income attributable to common stock or $0.09 per share) for the year 2009.  From January 1 through January 20, 2010, FCX repaid $75 million of its 8.25% Senior Notes due 2015 through open-market purchases at a cost of $82 million.  FCX will consider additional opportunities to prepay debt in advance of scheduled maturities.
 
FCXs debt maturities through 2012 are indicated in the table below (in millions).
 
At December 31, 2009, FCX had 430 million common shares outstanding.  Assuming conversion of FCXs 6% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, which automatically converts on May 1, 2010, FCX would have between approximately 469 million and 477 million common shares outstanding (depending on the applicable market price of FCXs common stock).
 
 
OUTLOOK
 
Projected sales volumes for 2010 approximate 3.8 billion pounds of copper, 1.8 million ounces of gold and 60 million pounds of molybdenum, including 890 million pounds of copper, 490 thousand ounces of gold and 15 million pounds of molybdenum in the first quarter of 2010.  The sequencing in mining areas with varying ore grades, primarily at Grasberg, causes fluctuations in the timing of ore production, and is expected to result in fluctuations in quarterly sales of copper and gold in 2010.  The achievement of FCXs sales estimates will be dependent on the achievement of targeted mining rates, the successful operation of production facilities, the impact of weather conditions and other factors.
 
Using estimated sales volumes for 2010 and assuming average prices of $3.25 per pound of copper, $1,100 per ounce of gold and $12 per pound of molybdenum for the year 2010, FCXs consolidated operating cash flows, net of an estimated $0.4 billion of working capital requirements, are estimated to approximate $5.3 billion in 2010.  The impact of price changes on FCXs operating cash

flows in 2010 would approximate $260 million for each $0.10 per pound change for copper, $50 million for each $50 per ounce change for gold and $45 million for each $1 per pound change for molybdenum.
 
FCXs capital expenditures are currently estimated to approximate $1.7 billion for 2010.  Capital expenditures for major projects in 2010 are expected to approximate $0.8 billion, which primarily includes underground development activities at Grasberg and the sulfide ore project at El Abra.  Capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted in response to changes in market conditions and other factors.
 
 
FINANCIAL POLICY
 
FCX has a long-standing tradition of seeking to build shareholder value through pursuing development projects with high rates of return and returning cash to shareholders through common stock dividends and share purchases.  FCX is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet.
 
In October 2009, FCXs Board of Directors reinstated an annual cash dividend on its common stock of $0.60 per share.  The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on December 30, 2009, with the dividend payable on February 1, 2010.  The Board will continue to review FCXs financial policy on an ongoing basis.

This press release contains forward-looking statements in which we discuss factors we believe may affect our performance in the future.  Forward-looking statements are all statements other than historical facts, such as statements regarding projected ore grades and milling rates, projected sales volumes, projected unit net cash costs, projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditures, the impact of copper, gold, molybdenum and cobalt price changes, reserve estimates, potential prepayments of debt and future dividend payments.  The declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of FCXs Board of Directors and will depend on FCXs financial results, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.  This press release also includes forward-looking statements regarding mineralized material not included in reserves.  The mineralized material described in this press release will not qualify as reserves until comprehensive engineering studies establish their economic feasibility.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the estimated mineralized material not included in reserves will become proven and probable reserves.  Accuracy of the forward-looking statements depends on assumptions about events that change over time and is thus susceptible to periodic change based on actual experience and new developments.  FCX cautions readers that it assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements in this press release and does not intend to update the forward-looking statements more frequently than quarterly.  Additionally, important factors that might cause future results to differ from results anticipated by forward-looking statements include mine sequencing, production rates, industry risks, commodity prices, political risks, the potential effects of violence in Indonesia, potential outcomes of the contract review process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, weather-related risks, labor relations, currency translation risks and other factors described in FCX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC.

PRODUCT REVENUES AND UNIT NET CASH COSTS
Unit net cash costs per pound of copper and per pound of molybdenum are measures intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of FCXs mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for the respective operations.  FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations.  This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although FCXs measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
FCX presents gross profit per pound of copper using both a by-product method and a co-product method.  FCX uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (i) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (ii) it mines ore, which contains copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals, (iii) it is not possible to specifically assign all of FCXs costs to revenues from the copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals it produces, (iv) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (v) it is the method used by FCXs management and Board of Directors to monitor operations.  In the co-product method presentations, costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent FCXs metals sales volumes and realized prices change.
In both the by-product and the co-product method calculations, FCX shows adjustments to copper revenues for prior period open sales as separate line items.  Because the copper pricing adjustments do not result from current period sales, FCX has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales.  Noncash and nonrecurring costs consist of items such as stock-based compensation costs, lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, write-offs of equipment or unusual charges.  They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs.  Gold, molybdenum and other metal revenues at copper mines are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
FCXs fourth-quarter 2009 income tax provision resulted from taxes on international operations ($744 million) and U.S. operations ($6 million).  FCXs income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2009 resulted from taxes on international operations ($2.3 billion) and U.S. operations ($35 million).  FCXs effective tax rate for 2009 has been highly sensitive to changes in commodity prices and the mix of income between U.S. and international operations.  The differences between FCXs consolidated effective tax rates for the 2009 periods and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35 percent were primarily attributable to the high proportion of income earned in Indonesia, which was taxed at an effective rate of 42 percent.
FCXs fourth-quarter 2008 income tax benefit resulted from a benefit on international operations ($789 million) and U.S. operations ($3.7 billion).  FCXs income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted from taxes on international operations ($604 million) and a benefit on U.S. operations ($3.4 billion).  The differences between FCXs consolidated effective income tax rates for the 2008 periods and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35 percent were primarily attributable to goodwill impairment charges, which were non-deductible for tax purposes, and the recognition of a valuation allowance against U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits, partly offset by benefits for percentage depletion and U.S. state income taxes.
Summaries of the approximate amounts in the calculation of FCXs consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the three months and years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 follow (in millions, except percentages):

FCX has organized its operations into five primary divisions  North America copper mines, South America copper mines, Indonesia mining, Africa mining and Molybdenum operations.  Notwithstanding this structure, FCX internally reports information on a mine-by-mine basis.  Therefore, FCX concluded that its operating segments include individual mines.  Operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments.  Further discussion of the reportable segments included in FCXs primary operating divisions, as well as FCXs other reportable segments  Rod & Refining and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining  follows.
  FCX has six operating copper mines in North America  Morenci, Sierrita, Bagdad, Safford, Miami and Tyrone.  The North America copper mines division includes Morenci as a reportable segment.  Other North America copper mines include FCXs other southwestern U.S. copper mines, including mines on care-and-maintenance status.  In addition to copper, the Sierrita and Bagdad mines produce molybdenum concentrates as a by-product.
North America Copper Mines.
  FCX has four operating copper mines in South America  Cerro Verde in Peru, and Candelaria, Ojos del Salado and El Abra in Chile.  The South America copper mines division includes Cerro Verde as a reportable segment.  Other South America copper mines include FCXs Chilean copper mines.  In addition to copper, the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mines produce gold and silver as by-products.
South America Copper Mines.
  Indonesia mining includes PT Freeport Indonesias Grasberg minerals district.  PT Freeport Indonesia produces copper concentrates, which contain significant quantities of gold and silver.
Indonesia.
  Africa mining includes the Tenke Fungurume copper and cobalt mine.  The Tenke Fungurume mine produces copper cathode and cobalt hydroxide.  Copper cathode production commenced in March 2009 and the first copper cathode was sold in the second quarter of 2009.  The cobalt plant and sulphuric acid plant were commissioned in the third quarter of 2009.
Africa.
  The Molybdenum segment includes the Henderson molybdenum mine in Colorado and related conversion facilities.  The Molybdenum segment also includes a sales company that purchases and sells molybdenum from the Henderson mine as well as from the North and South America copper mines that produce molybdenum as a by-product.
Molybdenum.
  The Rod & Refining segment consists of copper conversion facilities located in North America, including a refinery, three rod mills and a specialty copper products facility.  This segment processes copper produced at FCXs North America mines and purchased copper into copper cathode, rod and custom copper shapes.  At times this segment refines copper and produces copper rod and shapes for customers on a toll basis.
Rod & Refining.
  Atlantic Copper, FCXs wholly owned smelting unit in Spain, smelts and refines copper concentrates and markets refined copper and precious metals in slimes.
Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining.
  Intersegment sales between FCXs operations are based on similar arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale.  Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums.
Intersegment Sales
.
  FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to the operating divisions and individual segments.  However, not all costs and expenses applicable to a mine or operation are allocated.  All U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level, whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable mine or operation.  In addition, most exploration and research activities are managed at the corporate level, and those costs along with some selling, general and administrative costs are not allocated to the operating divisions or segments.  Accordingly, the following segment information reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity.

After adjusting for special items totaling $14.0 billion, $36.84 per share, fourth-quarter 2008 adjusted net income totaled $23 million, $0.06 per share.  Taxes on the special items were calculated using the rates applied to record the acquisition of Phelps Dodge (approximately 39 percent) or the marginal tax rate in the applicable jurisdiction.  FCX receives no tax benefit for goodwill impairments.  Special items resulting in increases (decreases) to financial results for the fourth quarter of 2008 are included in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts):
