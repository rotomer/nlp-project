Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. Announces
Redemption of its Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2015
 
 
PHOENIX, AZ, March 2, 2010  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) announced today that it has issued a notice to redeem all of its outstanding Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2015 (Notes) on April 1, 2010.  There is $1 billion in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes.
 
Holders of record will receive 101 percent of the principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest from October 1, 2009 to the redemption date.  The Notes bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%.  Based on the current forward LIBOR rates through the 2015 maturity of the Notes, the annual interest cost savings over the life of the Notes would average approximately $58 million per annum.  FCX expects to record an approximate $20 million charge to net income in the second quarter of 2010 in connection with the redemption.  The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, has distributed to the registered note holders written notice of the specific terms of the redemption.
 
At December 31, 2009, FCX had $6.3 billion in total debt and consolidated cash of $2.7 billion.  During January and February 2010, FCX completed open market purchases of its 8.25% Senior Notes and its 8.375% Senior Notes totaling approximately $270 million.  Following the completion of the redemption of the Notes and including the year-to-date open market purchases, FCXs total debt would approximate $5.0 billion.
