In any action brought against
Notice
Section 2.9
 
any indemnified party, it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected; , that, (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party or (ii) if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel, with the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no indemnified party shall settle any action brought against it with respect to which such indemnified party is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the indemnifying party, unless the settlement thereof includes a complete release from all liability of, the indemnifying party.
Section 2.9
provided, however
          (d) . If the indemnification provided for in this is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to any indemnified party, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of such indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; , that in no event shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the lesser of (A) the amount which such Selling Holder would have been obligated to pay under if such indemnity was available to the indemnified party and (B) the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the Parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any Loss that is the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the

Board of Directors; Governance
          (a) Subject to the other provisions of this , (i) for so long as Freeport and its controlled affiliates collectively own shares of Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Preferred Shares owned by Freeport and its controlled affiliates) representing more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the percentage of the outstanding shares of Common Stock owned by Freeport and its controlled affiliates on the date hereof (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Preferred Shares owned by Freeport and its controlled affiliates), Freeport shall have the right to designate two (2) members to be nominated to the Board and (ii) for so long as Freeport and its controlled affiliates collectively own shares of Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Preferred Shares owned by Freeport and its controlled affiliates) representing at least twenty-five percent (25%) and less than or equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the percentage of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Preferred Shares owned by Freeport and its controlled affiliates) owned by Freeport and its controlled affiliates on the date hereof, Freeport shall have the right to designate one (1) member to be nominated to the Board. The Issuer shall cause the person(s) to be designated by Freeport (such designee(s) referred to herein as the "") to be nominated for election at an annual or special stockholders meeting of the Issuer and shall take all actions necessary or advisable to cause the Board to recommend that the stockholders vote "FOR", and solicit proxies for, the election of the Freeport Designee(s). If a Freeport Designee is nominated and not elected at an annual or special stockholders meeting of the Issuer or is removed by the stockholders, then Freeport shall provide the Issuer the name of a replacement Freeport Designee and, provided that such person satisfies the requirements of this Section 2.7(a) and Freeport maintains the applicable designation rights specified in the first sentence of this Section 2.7(a), the Board and the Issuer shall take such actions as may be necessary to appoint such person to serve as a member of the Board, including, if applicable, increasing the size of the Board and appointing such Freeport Designee to fill the newly-created directorship. If a Freeport Designee (or any successor designee appointed pursuant to this paragraph) ceases for any reason to serve as a director of the Company after having been duly appointed or elected, then, provided that Freeport maintains the applicable designation rights specified in the first sentence of this , Freeport shall have the right to designate a replacement for such Freeport Designee to hold office for the remaining unexpired term of the Freeport Designee. Any Freeport Designee appointed or elected to Issuer's Board may be removed for cause in accordance with applicable Law or the Issuer's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and shall (A) have the requisite skill and experience to serve as a director of a publicly traded company, and (B) not be prohibited or disqualified from serving as a director of the Issuer pursuant to any rule or regulation of the SEC or NYSE or by applicable Law.
Section 2.7
Freeport Designee(s)
Section 2.7(a)
          (b) Freeport shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Freeport Designee to provide responses that shall be true and correct in all material respects to all reasonable requests for information by the Issuer in connection with the proxy materials to be filed by the Company in connection with its stockholder meetings, and each Freeport Designee shall promptly provide an agreement consenting to be named as a nominee in such proxy materials and to serve as a director upon election to the Board. In addition, upon the Issuer's request made at any time, Freeport shall cause the Freeport Designee(s), if any, to complete and execute the Issuer's standard director and officer questionnaire prior to being admitted to the
 
Board or standing for election or reelection at an annual meeting of stockholders or at such other time as may be reasonably requested by Issuer. Not less than 120 days prior to each annual meeting of stockholders of the Issuer (assuming for purposes of this that each such annual meeting shall be held on the anniversary of the prior year's annual meeting), Freeport shall provide the Issuer with written notice of the name(s) of the Freeport Designee, if any, to be nominated for election at such meeting. Within 10 days after receipt of such notice, the Issuer shall provide Freeport with written notice as to whether the Freeport Designee(s) reasonably satisfy the requirements of Section 2.7(a). If it is determined that a Freeport Designee does not reasonably satisfy the requirements of Section 2.7(a) or if a Freeport Designee fails to take any of the actions set forth in this Section 2.7(b) (in which case the Issuer shall have no obligation under this Section 2.7 with respect to such Freeport Designee), then Freeport shall have the right to appoint substitute Freeport Designee(s).
Section 2.7(b)
          (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this , Freeport shall not be entitled to designate a Freeport Designee and the Issuer shall have no obligations under this with respect to such Freeport Designee to the extent the sum of the number of the Freeport Designees (including any nominees to the Board) and the number of the members of or nominees to the Board who are also either a member of the board of directors of Freeport or any affiliate or an officer of Freeport or any affiliate equals or exceeds two (2); provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that if the holders of Preferred Shares (together with any parity stock with like voting rights that are exercisable) are entitled to designate two additional directors pursuant to the Certificate of Designations on account of dividends payable to the holders of Preferred Shares being in arrears for six calendar quarters (whether or not consecutive) and such unpaid dividends not being fully paid or set aside for payment, any of such directors shall not count as "Freeport Designees". Accordingly, notwithstanding that concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and the "Closing" (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) of the transactions under the Stock Purchase Agreement Freeport owns a number of shares of Common Stock which would entitle it to designate two (2) Freeport Designees pursuant to Section 2.7(a), Freeport will not have the right to designate any Freeport Designees as members of the Board as of the Closing if as of such Closing, and for so long thereafter as, the number of members of Freeport's board of directors or its executive officers also serving on the Board exceeds two (2). If at any time Freeport and its controlled affiliates collectively own shares of Common Stock representing less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the percentage of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Preferred Shares owned by Freeport and its controlled affiliates) owned by Freeport and its controlled affiliates on the date hereof, Freeport shall have no right to designate any Freeport Designees, and the Issuer shall not have any obligations under this .

Section 2.7
          (d) For so long as Freeport and its controlled affiliates collectively own at least five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (including shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Preferred Shares owned by Freeport and its controlled affiliates) Freeport shall, and shall cause each of its controlled affiliates holding shares of Common Stock to, at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of Issuer, however called, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause its shares of Common Stock to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum.
 
          (e) Each time the Board appoints a Freeport Designee, it will also adopt resolutions such that each Freeport Designee (a) qualifies as a "Continuing Director" for purposes of the indenture governing Issuer's 11.875% Senior Notes due 2014 and (b) will not be in the class of persons serving on the Board that could result in (x) a "Change of Control" as defined clause (iii) of the definition thereof in Issuer's indenture governing its 5-1/4% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011, (y) a "Change in Control" as defined on clause (b) of the definition thereof in Issuer's Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 6, 2007, as amended, or (z) a similar change of control under any other agreement to which Issuer is a party.
          (f) At all times when any Freeport Designee is serving as a member of the Board, and following any such Freeport Designee's death, resignation, removal or other cessation as a director of Issuer, each Freeport Designee shall be entitled to all rights of indemnification and exculpation as are then made available to any other member of the Board. With respect to such rights of indemnification, as between Freeport and its affiliates, on the one hand, and Issuer on the other hand, Issuer shall, in all events, be the full indemnitor of first resort and shall not be entitled to any contribution, indemnification or other payment by or from any of Freeport or its affiliates.
     Freeport shall not, and shall cause its controlled affiliates and each Freeport Designee not to, use nonpublic information obtained from such Freeport Designee's service on the Board in any manner adverse to the Issuer.
