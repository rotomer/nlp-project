OPERATIONS
Consolidated.
Third-quarter
2011
consolidated copper sales of
947 million
pounds were slightly higher than the July
2011
estimate of
940 million
pounds primarily because of timing of shipments in North America. As anticipated, third-quarter 2011 copper sales were lower than third-quarter 2010 sales primarily because of lower sales in Indonesia and South America, partly offset by higher North America sales.
Third-quarter
2011
consolidated gold sales of
409 thousand
ounces were slightly below the July
2011
estimate of
415 thousand
ounces and lower than
third-quarter
2010
sales of
497 thousand
ounces, primarily reflecting lower Grasberg production.
Third-quarter
2011
consolidated molybdenum sales of
19 million
pounds were higher than the July
2011
estimate of
18 million
pounds and
third-quarter
2010
sales of
17 million
pounds.
During third-quarter 2011, production and sales of copper and gold were adversely affected by labor disruptions at PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI). The estimated impact on third-quarter 2011 production, including the eight-day strike in July 2011 and the ongoing strike that commenced on September 15, 2011, totaled approximately 70 million pounds of copper and 100 thousand ounces of gold. Without the impacts of the strike, third-quarter 2011 sales from Grasberg would have exceeded forecasted production and sales because of access to higher grade ore previously scheduled to be mined in future periods. PT-FI has developed revised operating plans to produce and ship concentrates at modified levels with a reduced workforce and sold concentrate from inventory during third-quarter 2011, which partly mitigated the lower production levels.
The union has notified PT-FI that it intends to extend the strike to November 15, 2011. PT-FI continues to seek to end the strike, which has no legal basis, and to conclude negotiations, on a fair and reasonable basis, of the bi-annual renewal of its collective labor agreement. PT-FI's compensation practices are highly competitive in Indonesia, and PT-FI has agreed to accept the recommendations of the government-appointed mediator for a generous increase in wages and other benefits.
Consolidated sales from mines for the year
2011
are expected to approximate
3.8 billion
pounds of copper,
1.6 million
ounces of gold and
78 million
pounds of molybdenum, including
915 million
pounds of copper,
305 thousand
ounces of gold and
18 million
pounds of molybdenum in
fourth-quarter
2011
. Fourth-quarter 2011 sales estimates reflect reduced operations at PT-FI resulting from the current strike conditions. The impact for the year 2011, which is subject to change based on operating rates, mine plans, the extent to which PT-FI can operate using a reduced workforce, and the timing of the resumption of normal operations, is estimated to approximate 100 million pounds of copper and 100 thousand ounces of gold.
Consolidated average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) of
$0.80
per pound of copper in
third-quarter
2011
were lower than unit net cash costs of
$0.82
per pound in
third-quarter
2010
as higher gold, molybdenum and silver credits more than offset higher site production and delivery costs. Higher site production and delivery costs primarily reflected lower copper sales volumes in Indonesia and South America and increased mining and milling activities in North America.
Assuming average prices of
$1,600
per ounce of gold and
$14
per pound of molybdenum for
fourth-quarter
2011
and achievement of current
2011
sales volume and cost estimates, consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for FCX's copper mining operations are expected to average approximately
$0.95
per pound of copper for the year
2011
. Quarterly unit net cash costs vary with fluctuations in sales volumes and average realized prices for gold and molybdenum. Fourth-quarter 2011 unit net cash costs are expected to be higher than the average for the year primarily reflecting lower volumes in Indonesia. The impact of price changes on consolidated unit net cash costs would approximate
$0.006
per pound for each
$50
per ounce change in the average price of gold during
fourth-quarter
2011
and
$0.004
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of molybdenum during
fourth-quarter
2011
.

North America Copper Mines.
FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America - Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Tyrone and Chino in New Mexico. All of the North America mining operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci. FCX records its 85 percent joint venture interest in Morenci using the proportionate consolidation method. In addition to copper, the Morenci, Bagdad and Sierrita mines also produce molybdenum concentrates.
Operating and Development Activities.
During 2010, FCX initiated plans to increase production at its North America copper mines, which had been curtailed in late 2008 because of weak market conditions. The projects included restarting milling operations and increasing mining rates at Morenci and Chino, and restarting the Miami mine. The project at Morenci is complete with an incremental impact of 125 million pounds of copper per year, and the ramp up of activities at Miami and Chino are continuing. Production at Miami currently approximates 60 million pounds of copper per year. Production at Chino, which is expected to produce approximately 70 million pounds of copper in 2011, is expected to increase to approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year by 2014.
FCX also has a number of opportunities to invest in additional production capacity at several of its North America copper mines. Positive exploration results in recent years indicate the potential for additional sulfide development in North America.
At Morenci, FCX is advancing a feasibility study to expand mining and milling capacity to process additional sulfide ores identified through positive exploratory drilling. This project, which would require significant investment, would increase milling rates from the current level of 50,000 metric tons of ore per day to approximately 115,000 metric tons of ore per day and target incremental annual copper production of approximately 225 million pounds within a three year timeframe. Completion of the feasibility study is expected in early 2012.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the North America copper mines for the
third quarters
and
first nine months of
2011 and 2010:
Consolidated copper sales volumes from North America of
307 million
pounds in
third-quarter
2011
were higher than
third-quarter
2010
sales of
267 million
pounds primarily reflecting increased production at the Morenci, Miami and Chino mines.
FCX expects sales from the North America copper mines to approximate
1.2 billion
pounds of copper for the year
2011
, compared with
1.1 billion
pounds of copper in
2010
.
As anticipated, average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines of
$1.42
per pound of copper in
third-quarter
2011
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$1.36
per pound in
third-
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
                            
4
quarter
2010
, primarily reflecting increased mining and milling activities and higher input costs. Higher molybdenum credits partly offset the increase in site production and delivery costs.
FCX estimates that average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines would approximate
$1.42
per pound of copper for the year
2011
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average molybdenum price of
$14
per pound for
fourth-quarter
2011
. North America's average unit net cash costs for
2011
would change by approximately
$0.01
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of molybdenum during
fourth-quarter
2011
.
South America Mining.
FCX operates four copper mines in South America - Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra, Candelaria and Ojos del Salado in Chile. FCX owns a 53.56 percent interest in Cerro Verde, a 51 percent interest in El Abra, and 80 percent of the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mining complexes. All operations in South America are consolidated in FCX's financial statements. South America mining includes open-pit and underground mining. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine produces molybdenum concentrates, and the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mines produce gold and silver.
Operating and Development Activities.
During 2011, FCX commenced production from El Abra's newly commissioned stacking and leaching facilities to transition from oxide to sulfide ores. Production from the sulfide ore is expected to approximate 300 million pounds of copper per year, replacing the currently depleting oxide copper production. The aggregate capital investment for this project is expected to total $725 million through 2015, including $580 million for the initial phase of the project expected to be completed by the end of 2011.
FCX is also engaged in pre-feasibility studies for a potential large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. Positive exploration results at El Abra indicate the potential for a significant sulfide resource. Exploration activities are continuing.
At Cerro Verde, plans for a large-scale concentrator expansion continue to be advanced. The approximate $4 billion project would expand the concentrator facilities from 120,000 metric tons of ore per day to 360,000 metric tons of ore per day and provide incremental annual production of approximately 600 million pounds of copper beginning in 2016. FCX expects to file an environmental impact assessment in fourth-quarter 2011.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the South America mining operations for the
third quarters
and
first nine months of
2011 and 2010:
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold

Copper sales from South America mining of
322 million
pounds in
third-quarter
2011
were lower than
third-quarter
2010
sales of
377 million
pounds primarily reflecting lower production at Candelaria and the timing of shipments.
During third-quarter 2011, Cerro Verde's union workforce commenced a series of strike actions. The most recent strike commenced on September 29, 2011. Cerro Verde is working in good faith to complete negotiations with the workers' union for a new labor agreement. Production of copper and molybdenum has not been materially affected.
FCX expects South America's sales to approximate of
1.3 billion
pounds of copper and
100 thousand
ounces of gold for the year
2011
, similar to
2010
sales of
1.3 billion
pounds of copper and
93 thousand
ounces of gold.
Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America of
$1.15
per pound of copper in
third-quarter
2011
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$1.13
per pound in
third-quarter
2010
. Higher site production and delivery costs primarily reflected lower copper sales volumes, partly offset by higher gold, molybdenum and silver credits.
FCX estimates that average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America mining would approximate
$1.17
per pound of copper for the year
2011
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of
$1,600
per ounce of gold and
$14
per pound of molybdenum during
fourth-quarter
2011
.
Indonesia Mining.
Through its 90.64 percent owned and wholly consolidated subsidiary PT-FI, FCX operates the world's largest copper and gold mine in terms of reserves at its Grasberg operations in Papua, Indonesia.
Operating and Development Activities.
FCX has several projects in process in the Grasberg minerals district, primarily related to the development of the large-scale, high-grade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the Grasberg open pit. In aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to ramp up to approximately 240,000 metric tons of ore per day following the currently anticipated transition from the Grasberg open pit in 2016.
The Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) mine, one of the world's largest underground mines, has been expanded to a capacity of 80,000 metric tons of ore per day and a feasibility study for the Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) has been completed. The high-grade Big Gossan mine, which began producing in
fourth-quarter
2010
, is expected to reach full rates of 7,000 metric tons of ore per day by the end of 2012. Substantial progress has been made in developing infrastructure and underground workings that will enable access to the underground ore bodies. Development of the terminal infrastructure and mine access for the Grasberg Block Cave and DMLZ ore bodies is in progress. Over the next five years, estimated aggregate capital spending is expected to average approximately $635 million ($500 million net to PT-FI) per year on underground development activities.

Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Indonesia mining operations for the
third quarters
and
first nine months of
2011 and 2010:
At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing of mining areas with varying ore grades causes fluctuations in the timing of ore production resulting in varying quarterly and annual sales of copper and gold. Indonesia's
third-quarter
2011
copper sales of
253 million
pounds and gold sales of
384 thousand
ounces were lower than
third-quarter
2010
copper sales of
364 million
pounds and gold sales of
466 thousand
ounces primarily because of planned sequencing of mining in a lower ore-grade section of the Grasberg open pit and the impact of labor disruptions during the quarter. The estimated impact from labor disruptions on third-quarter 2011 production, including the eight-day strike in July 2011 and the ongoing strike that commenced on September 15, 2011, totaled approximately 70 million pounds of copper and 100 thousand ounces of gold. PT-FI has developed revised operating plans to produce and ship concentrates at modified levels with a reduced workforce and also sold concentrate from inventory during third-quarter 2011, which partly mitigated the lower production levels.
FCX expects sales from Indonesia to approximate
1.0 billion
pounds of copper and
1.45 million
ounces of gold for the year
2011
, compared with
1.2 billion
pounds of copper and
1.8 million
ounces of gold for the year
2010
. Indonesia's fourth-quarter 2011 sales estimates of 185 million pounds of copper and 280 thousand ounces of gold reflect the impact of labor disruptions and expected mining in a lower ore-grade section of the Grasberg open pit. The impact of labor disruptions for the year 2011, which is subject to change based on operating rates, mine plans, the extent to which we can operate using a reduced workforce, and the timing of resumption of normal operations, is estimated to approximate 100 million pounds of copper and 100 thousand ounces of gold.
Because of the fixed nature of a large portion of Indonesia's costs, unit costs vary from quarter to quarter depending on volumes of copper and gold sold, as well as average realized gold prices during the period. Unit net cash costs (including gold and silver credits) for Indonesia averaged a net credit of
$0.48
per pound of copper in
third-quarter
2011
, compared to a net cost of
$0.10
per pound in
third-quarter
2010
. The favorable variance was primarily associated with higher gold and silver credits that more than offset increases in site production and delivery costs primarily from lower copper volumes.
FCX estimates Indonesia's average unit net cash costs (net of gold and silver credits) would approximate
$0.03
per pound of copper for the year
2011
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average gold price of
$1,600
per ounce during
fourth-quarter
2011
. Indonesia's unit net cash costs for
2011
would change by approximately
$0.025
per pound for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold during
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
                            
7
fourth-quarter
2011
. Fourth-quarter 2011 unit net cash costs are expected to be higher than the average for the year primarily because of lower volumes.
Africa Mining.
FCX currently holds an effective 57.75 percent interest in the Tenke Fungurume (Tenke) copper and cobalt mining concessions in the Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In addition to copper, the Tenke mine produces cobalt hydroxide. Tenke's operations are consolidated in FCX's financial statements. FCX's interest in Tenke will be reduced to 56 percent after receiving the required government approval of the modifications to Tenke Fungurume Mining's bylaws that reflect the agreement with the DRC government.
Operating and Development Activities.
The milling facilities at Tenke, which were designed to produce at a rate of 8,000 metric tons of ore per day, have performed above capacity, with throughput averaging
12,000
metric tons of ore per day in
third-quarter
2011
and
10,800
metric tons of ore per day for the
first nine months of
2011
. Mining rates have been increased to enable additional copper production from the initial project capacity of 250 million pounds per year to approximately 290 million pounds per year.
FCX is undertaking a second phase of the project, which would include optimizing the current plant and increasing capacity. As part of the second phase, FCX plans to expand the mill rate to 14,000 metric tons of ore per day and to construct related processing facilities that would target the addition of approximately 150 million pounds of copper per year. The approximate $850 million project, which includes mill upgrades, additional mining equipment, a new tankhouse and sulphuric acid plant expansion, is targeted for completion in 2013.
FCX continues to engage in drilling activities, exploration analyses and metallurgical testing to evaluate the potential of the highly prospective minerals district at Tenke. These analyses are being incorporated in future plans to evaluate opportunities for expansion.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Africa mining operations for the
third quarters
and
first nine months of
2011 and 2010:
Copper sales from Africa of
65 million
pounds in
third-quarter
2011
were lower than
third-quarter
2010
copper sales of
73 million
pounds primarily reflecting the timing of shipments.
FCX expects Africa's sales to approximate
275 million
pounds of copper and
25 million
pounds of cobalt for the year
2011
, compared with
262 million
pounds of copper and
20 million
pounds of cobalt for the year
2010
.
Unit net cash costs (net of cobalt credits) for Africa of
$1.12
per pound of copper were higher than unit net
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
                            
8
cash costs of
$0.86
per pound in
third-quarter
2010
, primarily reflecting lower cobalt credits and higher site production and delivery costs from increased mining and milling activity and higher input costs.
FCX estimates Africa's average unit net cash costs would approximate
$1.03
per pound of copper for the year
2011
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average cobalt price of
$14
per pound for
fourth-quarter
2011
. Africa's unit net cash costs for
2011
would change by approximately
$0.03
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of cobalt during
fourth-quarter
2011
.
Molybdenum.
FCX is the world's largest producer of molybdenum. FCX conducts molybdenum mining operations at its wholly owned Henderson underground mine in Colorado, is developing the Climax molybdenum mine and sells molybdenum produced from its North and South America copper mines.
Development Activities.
Construction activities at the Climax molybdenum mine are approximately 80 percent complete. FCX plans to commence production during 2012. Production from the Climax molybdenum mine is expected to ramp up to a rate of 20 million pounds per year during 2013 and, depending on market conditions, may be increased to 30 million pounds per year. FCX intends to operate the Climax and Henderson molybdenum mines in a flexible manner to meet market requirements. FCX believes that Climax is one of the most attractive primary molybdenum development projects in the world, with large-scale production capacity, attractive cash costs and future growth options. Estimated remaining costs for the initial phase of the project approximate $135 million.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Molybdenum operations for the
third quarters
and
first nine months of
2011 and 2010:
Consolidated molybdenum sales of
19 million
pounds in
third-quarter
2011
were higher than
third-quarter
2010
sales of
17 million
pounds.
For the year
2011
, FCX expects molybdenum sales to approximate
78 million
pounds (including production of approximately
45 million
pounds from the North and South America copper mines), compared with
67 million
pounds in 2010 (including production of
32 million
pounds from the North and South America copper mines).
Unit net cash costs at the Henderson mine of
$6.24
per pound of molybdenum in
third-quarter
2011
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$5.94
per pound in
third-quarter
2010
, primarily reflecting higher input costs, including labor and materials.
Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, FCX expects average unit net cash costs for the Henderson mine to approximate
$6.50
per pound of molybdenum for the year
2011
.

EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES
FCX is conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves that will support the development of additional future production capacity in the large minerals districts where it currently operates. Favorable exploration results indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North and South America and in the Tenke Fungurume minerals district. The drilling data in North America continue to indicate the potential for expanded sulfide production.
Exploration spending for the year
2011
is expected to approximate
$250 million
, compared with
$113 million
in
2010
. Exploration activities will continue to focus primarily on the potential for future reserve additions in FCX's existing minerals districts.
PROVISIONAL PRICING AND OTHER
For the
first nine months of
2011
,
55 percent
of FCX's mined copper was sold in concentrate,
22 percent
as rod from North America operations and
23 percent
as cathode. Under the long-established structure of sales agreements prevalent in the industry, substantially all of FCX's copper concentrate and cathode sales are provisionally priced at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalized in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted London Metal Exchange (LME) monthly average spot prices. Because a significant portion of FCX's concentrate and cathode sales in any quarterly period usually remain subject to final pricing, the quarter-end forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenues and the average recorded copper price for the period. LME spot copper prices averaged
$4.07
per pound during
third-quarter
2011
, compared to FCX's recorded average price of
$3.60
per pound.
At
June 30, 2011
, FCX had provisionally priced copper sales at its copper mining operations, primarily South America and Indonesia, totaling
435 million
pounds (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average of
$4.27
per pound. Lower prices during
third-quarter
2011
resulted in adjustments to these provisionally priced copper sales and unfavorably impacted
third-quarter
2011
consolidated revenues by
$213 million
(
$100 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.11
per share), compared with adjustments to the
June 30, 2010
, provisionally priced copper sales that favorably impacted
third-quarter
2010
consolidated revenues by
$191 million
(
$85 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.09
per share). Adjustments to the
December 31, 2010
, provisionally priced copper sales unfavorably impacted consolidated revenues by
$12 million
(
$5 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.01
per share) for the
first nine months of
2011
, compared with adjustments to the
December 31, 2009
, provisionally priced copper sales that unfavorably impacted consolidated revenues by
$23 million
(
$9 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.01
per share) for the
first nine months of
2010
.
At
September 30, 2011
, FCX had provisionally priced copper sales at its copper mining operations, primarily South America and Indonesia, totaling
406 million
pounds of copper (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average of
$3.18
per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. FCX estimates that each $0.05 change in the price realized from the
September 30, 2011
, provisional price recorded would have an approximate
$13 million
effect on its
2011
net income attributable to common stock. The LME spot copper price on
October 18, 2011
, was
$3.30
per pound.
FCX defers recognizing profits on its sales from its Indonesia and South America mining operations to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of Indonesia's mining sales to PT Smelting (PT-FI's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit) until final sales to third parties occur. FCX's net deferred profits on its Indonesia and South America concentrate inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods' net income attributable to common stock totaled
$101 million
at
September 30, 2011
. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices will result in variability in FCX's net deferred profits and quarterly earnings.

CASH FLOWS
FCX generated operating cash flows of
$1.8 billion
for
third-quarter
2011
and
$5.9 billion
for the
first nine months of
2011
. These amounts are net of working capital sources (uses) of
$256 million
for the third quarter and
$(126) million
for the nine-month period.
Based on current
2011
sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of
$3.25
per pound of copper,
$1,600
per ounce of gold and
$14
per pound of molybdenum for
fourth-quarter
2011
, FCX's consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to approximate
$7 billion
for the year
2011
. The impact of price changes during fourth-quarter 2011 on operating cash flows would approximate
$75 million
for each
$0.10
per pound change in the average price of copper,
$10 million
for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold and
$10 million
for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.
Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled
$717 million
for
third-quarter
2011
and
$1.7 billion
for the
first nine months of
2011
. FCX's capital expenditures are currently estimated to approximate
$2.6 billion
for the year
2011
, including
$1.4 billion
for major projects and
$1.2 billion
for sustaining capital. Major projects for
2011
primarily include underground development activities at Grasberg, construction activities at the Climax molybdenum mine and completion of the initial phase of the sulfide ore project at El Abra. FCX is also considering additional investments at several of its sites. Capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted in response to changes in market conditions and other factors.
CASH AND DEBT
At September 30,
2011
, FCX had consolidated cash of
$5.1 billion
. Net of noncontrolling interests' share, taxes and other costs, cash available to the parent company totaled
$4.2 billion
as shown below (in billions):
a. Includes cash at FCX's parent company and North America operations.
At September 30,
2011
, FCX had
$3.5 billion
in debt. FCX had no borrowings and
$44 million
of letters of credit issued under its revolving credit facility resulting in total availability of approximately
$1.5 billion
at September 30,
2011
. Since January 1, 2009, FCX has repaid
$3.8 billion
in debt resulting in estimated annual interest savings of approximately
$260 million
based on current interest rates.
FCX does not have significant debt maturities in the near term (a total of $4 million through 2016); however, FCX may consider opportunities to prepay debt in advance of scheduled maturities. FCX has $3.0 billion in debt that is redeemable in whole or in part, at its option, at make-whole redemption prices prior to April 2012, and afterwards at stated redemption prices.
FINANCIAL POLICY
FCX has a long-standing tradition of seeking to build shareholder value through investing in projects with attractive rates of return and returning cash to shareholders through common stock dividends and share purchases. In addition to FCX's current annual common stock dividend of $1.00 per share (
$0.25
per share quarterly), on June 1, 2011, FCX paid a supplemental common stock dividend of $0.50 per share. For the
first nine months of
2011
, FCX has paid common stock dividends of
$1.2 billion
, which includes
$474 million
for the supplemental dividend paid on June 1,
2011
. FCX intends to continue to maintain a strong financial position, invest aggressively in attractive growth projects and provide cash returns to shareholders. The Board will continue to review FCX's financial policy on an ongoing basis.

PRODUCT REVENUES AND PRODUCTION COSTS
PRODUCT REVENUES AND UNIT NET CASH COSTS
Unit net cash costs per pound of copper and molybdenum are measures intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of FCX's mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for the respective operations. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although FCX's measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
FCX presents gross profit per pound of copper in the following tables using both a by-product method and a co-product method. FCX uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (i) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (ii) it mines ore, which contains copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals, (iii) it is not possible to specifically assign all of FCX's costs to revenues from the copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals it produces, (iv) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (v) it is the method used by FCX's management and Board of Directors to monitor operations. In the co-product method presentations, shared costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent FCX's metals sales volumes and realized prices change.
FCX shows revenue adjustments for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because these adjustments do not result from current period sales, FCX has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and other costs consist of items such as stock-based compensation costs, write-offs of equipment and/or unusual charges. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs. As discussed above, gold, molybdenum and other metal revenues at copper mines are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. Following are presentations under both the by-product and co-product methods together with reconciliations to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.

FREEPORT-McMoRan COPPER & GOLD INC.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
FCX has organized its operations into five primary divisions - North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining, Africa mining and Molybdenum operations. Notwithstanding this structure, FCX internally reports information on a mine-by-mine basis. Therefore, FCX concluded that its operating segments include individual mines. Operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments, which are separately disclosed in the following table.
Intersegment Sales.
Intersegment sales between FCX's operations are based on similar arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums.
Allocations.
FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to the operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to a mine or operation are allocated. All U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level, whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country. In addition, most exploration and research activities are managed at the corporate level, and those costs along with some selling, general and administrative costs are not allocated to the operating divisions or segments. Accordingly, the following segment information reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity.
