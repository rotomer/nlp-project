Section 1503(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose the receipt of certain orders and notices from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), including the receipt of any imminent danger order issued under Section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act).
On January 10, 2012, Freeport-McMoRan Tyrone Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and operator of the Tyrone mine in New Mexico, received an oral imminent danger order from a MSHA inspector alleging that a Tyrone employee was observed working in the open pit at the toe of a highwall that contained loose unconsolidated material. The employee was moved from the area, which immediately terminated the order. No accident or injury occurred.
