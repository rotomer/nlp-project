James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "FCX's fourth-quarter results reflect strong operating performance in the Americas and in Africa, and were unfavorably impacted by disruptions at our Grasberg operations in Indonesia. Despite the fourth-quarter disruptions, we achieved record financial results in 2011. We are pleased to have reached agreement with the union at the Grasberg mine and with the accomplishments of our team in completing pipeline repairs. We are taking steps to restore full operations. We are continuing to advance our growth projects which are expected to result in meaningful increases to copper and molybdenum production in future periods. Our exploration programs continue to identify opportunities to grow our reserve base. We ended the year with significantly more cash than debt and have a positive outlook for the future prospects of our business."

OPERATIONS
Consolidated.
Fourth-quarter
2011
consolidated copper sales of
823 million
pounds of copper and
133 thousand
ounces of gold were lower than October 2011 estimates of 915 million pounds of copper and 305 thousand ounces of gold and the fourth-quarter 2010 sales of
941 million
pounds of copper and
590 thousand
ounces of gold, primarily because of labor disruptions and the temporary suspension of milling operations at PT Freeport Indonesia as a result of damage to the concentrate and fuel pipelines. Copper and gold sales were higher than the revised December 2011 estimates of 800 million pounds of copper and 105 thousand ounces of gold, primarily because of higher Grasberg production and timing of shipments, principally in North America. The estimated impact of the labor and pipeline disruptions, net to PT Freeport Indonesia, totaled 165 million pounds of copper and 170 thousand ounces of gold for fourth-quarter 2011, and 235 million pounds of copper and 275 thousand ounces of gold for the year 2011.
Fourth-quarter
2011
consolidated molybdenum sales of
19 million
pounds were higher than the October
2011
estimate of
18 million
pounds and
fourth-quarter
2010
sales of
17 million
pounds.
PT Freeport Indonesia's milling operations were temporarily suspended during fourth-quarter 2011 because of damage to concentrate and fuel pipelines resulting from civil unrest that occurred during the course of the strike. The financial terms of a new two-year labor agreement for PT Freeport Indonesia were reached in mid-December 2011. Repairs to the damaged pipelines are substantially complete and PT Freeport Indonesia has begun ramping up production. PT Freeport Indonesia is working cooperatively with the Government of Indonesia to address security issues. Maintaining security is a requirement of returning to normal operations. Mobilization of the workforce is in progress and full operations are expected to be restored during first-quarter 2012.
Consolidated sales from mines for the year
2012
are expected to approximate
3.8 billion
pounds of copper,
1.2 million
ounces of gold and
80 million
pounds of molybdenum, including
875 million
pounds of copper,
425 thousand
ounces of gold and
20 million
pounds of molybdenum in
first-quarter
2012
. FCX's projected 2012 copper sales volumes are expected to be higher, compared to 2011, primarily because of higher production from North America and Indonesia, partly offset by slightly lower production in South America. Gold sales in 2012 are projected to be lower than 2011 sales because of mine sequencing in Indonesia. Molybdenum sales in 2012 are expected to be similar to 2011, with higher production from primary molybdenum mines offset by lower production from FCX's North and South America copper mines. The achievement of projected 2012 sales volumes depends on a number of factors, including the timing of restoring normal operations at Grasberg following the extended disruption.
As anticipated, consolidated average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) of
$1.57
per pound of copper in
fourth-quarter
2011
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$0.53
per pound in
fourth-quarter
2010
primarily because of lower copper and gold volumes in Indonesia. Fourth-quarter 2011 consolidated unit net cash costs include
$116 million
($0.14 per pound) primarily related to signing bonuses for new labor agreements and other employee costs in Indonesia and South America. Higher unit net cash costs also reflected higher mining and input costs in North and South America.
Assuming average prices of
$1,600
per ounce of gold and
$13
per pound of molybdenum and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for FCX's copper mining operations are expected to average approximately
$1.38
per pound of copper for the year
2012
. Consolidated unit net cash costs for 2012 are expected to be higher than in 2011 because of higher site production
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold

and delivery costs associated with labor, energy and other inputs, and lower by-product credits, partly offset by higher copper volumes. Quarterly unit net cash costs vary with fluctuations in sales volumes and average realized prices for gold and molybdenum. The impact of price changes on consolidated unit net cash costs would approximate
$0.015
per pound for each
$50
per ounce change in the average price of gold and
$0.02
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.
North America Copper Mines.
FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America - Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Tyrone and Chino in New Mexico. All of the North America mining operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci. FCX records its 85 percent joint venture interest in Morenci using the proportionate consolidation method. In addition to copper, certain of FCX's North America copper mines (primarily Sierrita, Bagdad and Morenci) also produce molybdenum concentrates.
Operating and Development Activities.
During 2010, FCX initiated plans to increase production at its North America copper mines, which had been curtailed in late 2008 because of weak market conditions. Projects included restarting milling operations and increasing mining rates at Morenci and Chino, and restarting the Miami mine. The project at Morenci is complete with an incremental impact of 125 million pounds of copper per year, and the ramp-up activities at Miami and Chino are continuing. Production at Miami totaled
66 million
pounds of copper in 2011 and is expected to be similar in 2012. Production at Chino, which produced
69 million
pounds of copper in 2011, is expected to increase to approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year by 2014.
FCX also has a number of opportunities to invest in additional production capacity at several of its North America copper mines. Positive exploration results in recent years indicate the potential for additional sulfide development in North America.
At Morenci, FCX is advancing a feasibility study to expand mining and milling capacity to process additional sulfide ores identified through positive exploratory drilling. This project, which would require significant investment, would increase milling rates from the current level of 50,000 metric tons of ore per day to approximately 115,000 metric tons of ore per day and target incremental annual copper production of approximately 225 million pounds within a three-year timeframe. Completion of the feasibility study is expected in the first half of 2012.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the North America copper mines for the
fourth quarters
and
years ended
2011
and
2010
:

Consolidated copper sales volumes from North America of
333 million
pounds in
fourth-quarter
2011
were higher than
fourth-quarter
2010
sales of
238 million
pounds primarily reflecting increased mining rates and timing of shipments.
FCX expects sales from the North America copper mines to approximate
1.3 billion
pounds of copper for the year
2012
, compared with
1.2 billion
pounds of copper in
2011
.
As anticipated, average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines of
$1.48
per pound of copper in
fourth-quarter
2011
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$1.33
per pound in
fourth-quarter
2010
, primarily reflecting higher site production and delivery costs associated with increased mining and milling activities and higher input costs. Higher unit net cash costs also reflected lower molybdenum credits.
FCX estimates that average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines would approximate
$1.67
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average molybdenum price of
$13
per pound. North America's average unit net cash costs for
2012
would change by approximately
$0.04
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. Higher projected unit net cash costs in 2012, compared to 2011, primarily reflect higher mining and milling rates and lower by-product credits associated with lower molybdenum grades and prices, partly offset by higher projected copper volumes.
South America Mining.
FCX operates four copper mines in South America - Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra, Candelaria and Ojos del Salado in Chile. FCX owns a 53.56 percent interest in Cerro Verde, a 51 percent interest in El Abra, and 80 percent of the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mining complexes. All operations in South America are consolidated in FCX's financial statements. South America mining includes open-pit and underground mining. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine produces molybdenum concentrates, and the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mines produce gold and silver.
Operating and Development Activities.
During 2011, FCX commenced production from El Abra's newly commissioned stacking and leaching facilities to transition from production of oxide to sulfide ores. Production from the sulfide ore approximates 300 million pounds of copper per year, replacing the depleting oxide copper production. The aggregate capital investment for this project is expected to total $725 million through 2015, including $580 million for the initial phase of the project that is expected to be completed in first-quarter 2012.
FCX is also engaged in pre-feasibility studies for a potential large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. Positive exploration results at El Abra indicate the potential for a significant sulfide resource. Exploration activities are continuing.
At Cerro Verde, plans for a large-scale concentrator expansion continue to be advanced. The approximate $4.0 billion project would expand the concentrator facilities from 120,000 metric tons of ore per day to 360,000 metric tons of ore per day and provide incremental annual production of approximately 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum beginning in 2016. An environmental impact assessment was filed in fourth-quarter 2011.

Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the South America mining operations for the
fourth quarters
and
years ended
2011
and
2010
:
Copper sales from South America mining of
357 million
pounds in
fourth-quarter
2011
were higher than
fourth-quarter
2010
sales of
340 million
pounds primarily reflecting higher production at El Abra and timing of shipments, partly offset by lower volumes at Cerro Verde.
In fourth-quarter 2011, there was an approximate two-month labor strike at Cerro Verde during the negotiation of a new labor agreement. The strike did not have a significant impact on production, and a new three-year agreement with the union was reached in late December 2011. Also during fourth-quarter 2011, El Abra negotiated a new four-year labor agreement with its union, which will replace the agreement scheduled to expire in July 2012.
FCX expects South America's sales to approximate
1.3 billion
pounds of copper and
100 thousand
ounces of gold for the year
2012
, similar to
2011
sales of
1.3 billion
pounds of copper and
101 thousand
ounces of gold. Lower projected ore grades at Cerro Verde and Candelaria in 2012 are expected to be partly offset by higher production at El Abra.
Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America of
$1.44
per pound of copper in
fourth-quarter
2011
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$1.16
per pound in
fourth-quarter
2010
, primarily reflecting higher site production and delivery costs associated with increased mining costs and the impact of the signing bonuses paid pursuant to new labor agreements.
FCX estimates that average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America mining would approximate
$1.41
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of
$1,600
per ounce of gold and
$13
per pound of molybdenum. Higher projected unit net cash costs in 2012, compared to 2011, primarily reflect increases in input costs, including labor and energy, lower by-product credits and slightly lower projected volumes.

Indonesia Mining.
Through its 90.64 percent owned and wholly consolidated subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia, FCX operates the world's largest copper and gold mine in terms of reserves at its Grasberg operations in Papua, Indonesia.
Operating and Development Activities.
FCX has several projects in process in the Grasberg minerals district, primarily related to the development of the large-scale, high-grade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the Grasberg open pit. In aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to ramp up to approximately 240,000 metric tons of ore per day following the currently anticipated transition from the Grasberg open pit in 2016.
The Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) mine, one of the world's largest underground mines, has been expanded to a capacity of 80,000 metric tons of ore per day and a feasibility study for the Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) has been completed. The high-grade Big Gossan mine, which began producing in fourth-quarter 2010, is expected to reach full rates of 7,000 metric tons of ore per day by mid-2013. Substantial progress has been made in developing infrastructure and underground workings that will enable access to the underground ore bodies. Development of the terminal infrastructure and mine access for the Grasberg Block Cave and DMLZ ore bodies is in progress. Over the next five years, estimated aggregate capital spending is expected to average approximately $700 million ($550 million net to PT Freeport Indonesia) per year on underground development activities.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Indonesia mining operations for the
fourth quarters
and
years ended
2011
and
2010
:
Indonesia's
fourth-quarter
2011
copper sales of
50 million
pounds and gold sales of
102 thousand
ounces were lower than
fourth-quarter
2010
copper sales of
295 million
pounds and gold sales of
565 thousand
ounces, reflecting the impact of labor-related disruptions and the temporary suspension of milling operations because of damage to the concentrate and fuel pipelines.    
The estimated impact of the labor and pipeline disruptions (net to PT Freeport Indonesia), including the eight-day work stoppage in July 2011, totaled 165 million pounds of copper and 170 thousand ounces of gold in fourth-quarter 2011, and 235 million pounds of copper and 275 thousand ounces of gold for the year 2011.

In December 2011, PT Freeport Indonesia reached an agreement with union officials to end the three-month strike that commenced on September 15, 2011. Pursuant to the terms, PT Freeport Indonesia agreed to increase base wages by 24 percent in the first year and by 13 percent in the second year (equivalent to a 40 percent increase over two-years on a compounded basis). PT Freeport Indonesia also paid a bonus equivalent to three months of base wages and agreed to provide other benefits, including enhancements to housing allowances, educational assistance and retirement savings plans. The parties also agreed that future wage negotiations would be based on living costs and the competitiveness of wages within Indonesia.
FCX expects sales from Indonesia to approximate
930 million
pounds of copper and
1.1 million
ounces of gold for the year
2012
, compared to 2011 sales of
846 million
pounds of copper and
1.3 million
ounces of gold. Gold sales in 2012 are projected to be lower than in 2011 because of mining in a lower grade section of the Grasberg mine in 2012. At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing of mining areas with varying ore grades also causes fluctuations in the timing of ore production resulting in varying quarterly and annual sales of copper and gold. The achievement of projected 2012 sales volumes depends on a number of factors, including the timing of restoring full operations at Grasberg following the extended disruption.
Unit net cash costs (including gold and silver credits) for Indonesia averaged
$3.57
per pound of copper in
fourth-quarter
2011
, compared to a net credit of
$0.91
per pound in
fourth-quarter
2010
, primarily reflecting lower copper and gold sales volumes and the impact of signing bonuses and other strike-related costs.
FCX estimates Indonesia's average unit net cash costs (net of gold and silver credits) would approximate
$0.98
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average gold price of
$1,600
per ounce. Indonesia's unit net cash costs for
2012
would change by approximately
$0.06
per pound for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold. Higher projected unit net cash costs in 2012, compared to 2011, primarily reflect higher input costs, including labor and energy, and lower by-product credits, partly offset by higher projected copper volumes. Quarterly unit net cash costs are expected to vary significantly with variations in quarterly metal sales volumes.
Africa Mining.
FCX currently holds an effective 57.75 percent interest in the Tenke Fungurume (Tenke) copper and cobalt mining concessions in the Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is the operator of Tenke. In addition to copper, the Tenke mine produces cobalt hydroxide. Tenke's operations are consolidated in FCX's financial statements. FCX's interest in Tenke will be reduced to 56 percent after receiving the required government approval of the modifications to Tenke Fungurume Mining's bylaws that reflect the agreement reached in December 2010 with the DRC government.
Operating and Development Activities.
The milling facilities at Tenke, which were designed to produce at a rate of 8,000 metric tons of ore per day, continue to perform above capacity, with throughput averaging
11,900
metric tons of ore per day in
fourth-quarter
2011
and
11,100
metric tons of ore per day for the year
2011
. Mining rates have been increased to enable additional copper production from the initial project capacity of 250 million pounds per year to approximately 290 million pounds per year.
FCX is undertaking a second phase of the project, which would include optimizing the current plant and increasing capacity. As part of the second phase, FCX is expanding the mill rate to 14,000 metric tons of ore per day and is constructing related processing facilities that would target the addition of approximately 150 million pounds of copper per year. Construction activities for the approximate $850 million project, which includes mill upgrades, additional mining equipment, a new tankhouse and sulphuric acid plant expansion, are underway and are targeted for completion in 2013.
FCX continues to engage in drilling activities, exploration analyses and metallurgical testing to evaluate the potential of the highly prospective minerals district at Tenke. These analyses are being incorporated in future plans to evaluate opportunities for expansion.

Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Africa mining operations for the
fourth quarters
and
years ended
2011
and
2010
:
Copper sales from Africa of
83 million
pounds in
fourth-quarter
2011
were higher than
fourth-quarter
2010
copper sales of
68 million
pounds primarily reflecting the timing of shipments and higher production.
FCX expects Africa's sales to approximate
290 million
pounds of copper and
25 million
pounds of cobalt for the year
2012
, compared with
283 million
pounds of copper and
25 million
pounds of cobalt for the year
2011
.
Unit net cash costs (net of cobalt credits) for Africa of
$1.30
per pound of copper were higher than unit net cash costs of
$0.89
per pound in
fourth-quarter
2010
, primarily reflecting higher site production and delivery costs related to higher input costs. Higher unit net cash costs also reflected lower cobalt credits.
FCX estimates Africa's average unit net cash costs would approximate
$1.13
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average cobalt price of
$12
per pound. Higher projected unit net cash costs in 2012, compared to 2011, primarily reflect lower cobalt credits, partly offset by higher projected copper volumes. Africa's unit net cash costs for
2012
would change by approximately
$0.11
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of cobalt.
Molybdenum.
FCX is the world's largest producer of molybdenum. FCX conducts molybdenum mining operations at its wholly owned Henderson underground mine in Colorado, is developing the Climax molybdenum mine and sells molybdenum produced from its North and South America copper mines.
Development Activities.
Construction activities at the Climax molybdenum mine are substantially complete, and FCX plans to commence production during 2012. Production from the Climax molybdenum mine is expected to ramp up to a rate of 20 million pounds per year during 2013 and, depending on market conditions, may be increased to 30 million pounds per year. FCX intends to operate the Climax and Henderson molybdenum mines in a flexible manner to meet market requirements. FCX believes that Climax is one of the most attractive primary molybdenum development projects in the world, with large-scale production capacity, attractive cash costs and future growth options. The costs of the initial phase of the project, most of which have been incurred, approximate $700 million.

Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Molybdenum operations for the
fourth quarters
and
years ended
2011
and
2010
:
Consolidated molybdenum sales of
19 million
pounds in
fourth-quarter
2011
were higher than
fourth-quarter
2010
sales of
17 million
pounds.
For the year
2012
, FCX expects molybdenum sales to approximate
80 million
pounds (including production of approximately
40 million
pounds from the North and South America copper mines), compared with
79 million
pounds in
2011
(including production of
45 million
pounds from the North and South America copper mines).
Unit net cash costs at the Henderson mine of
$6.87
per pound of molybdenum in
fourth-quarter
2011
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$6.36
per pound in
fourth-quarter
2010
, primarily reflecting higher input costs, including labor and materials.
Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, FCX expects average unit net cash costs for the Henderson mine to approximate
$7.00
per pound of molybdenum for the year
2012
.
RECOVERABLE PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES
FCX has significant reserves, resources and future development opportunities within its portfolio of assets. FCX's preliminary estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves at
December 31, 2011
, include
119.7 billion
pounds of copper,
33.9 million
ounces of gold and
3.42 billion
pounds of molybdenum, which were determined using long-term average prices of
$2.00
per pound for copper,
$750
per ounce for gold and
$10.00
per pound for molybdenum. FCX has added significant reserves in recent years and drilling activities conducted at its existing mines during 2011 indicated the potential for significant reserve additions in future periods.

Morenci mine in North America and the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia. Excluded from the table above are FCX's estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves of
0.86 billion
pounds for cobalt at Tenke Fungurume and
330.3 million
ounces for silver in Indonesia, South America and North America.
The following table summarizes changes in FCX's estimated preliminary consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper, gold and molybdenum reserves during 2011:
At
December 31, 2011
, in addition to preliminary consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves, FCX's preliminary estimated mineralized material (assessed using a long-term average copper price of
$2.20
per pound for copper) totals
115 billion
pounds of incremental contained copper. FCX continues to pursue aggressively opportunities to convert this mineralized material into reserves, future production volumes and cash flow.
EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES
FCX is conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves that will support the development of additional future production capacity in the large minerals districts where it currently operates. Favorable exploration results indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North and South America and in the Tenke Fungurume minerals district. The drilling data in North America continue to indicate the potential for expanded sulfide production.
Exploration spending for the year
2012
is expected to approximate
$275 million
, compared with
$221 million
in
2011
. Exploration activities will continue to focus primarily on the potential for future reserve additions in FCX's existing minerals districts.
PROVISIONAL PRICING AND OTHER
For the year
2011
,
51 percent
of FCX's mined copper was sold in concentrate,
26 percent
as cathode and
23 percent
as rod from North America operations. Under the long-established structure of sales agreements prevalent in the industry, substantially all of FCX's copper concentrate and cathode sales are provisionally priced at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalized in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted London Metal Exchange (LME) monthly average spot prices. Because a significant portion of FCX's concentrate and cathode sales in any quarterly period usually remain subject to final pricing, the quarter-end forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenues and the average recorded copper price for the period. During fourth-quarter 2011, LME spot copper prices averaged $3.40 per pound, compared to FCX's recorded average price of $3.42 per pound.
At
September 30, 2011
, FCX had provisionally priced copper sales at its copper mining operations, primarily South America and Indonesia, totaling
406 million
pounds (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average of
$3.18
per pound. Higher prices resulted in adjustments to these provisionally priced copper sales that favorably impacted
fourth-quarter
2011
consolidated revenues by
$125 million
(
$56 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.06
per share), compared with adjustments to the

, provisionally priced copper sales that favorably impacted

.
At
December 31, 2011
, FCX had provisionally priced copper sales at its copper mining operations, primarily South America and Indonesia, totaling
252 million
pounds of copper (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average of
$3.44
per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. FCX estimates that each $0.05 change in the price realized from the
December 31, 2011
, provisional price recorded would have an approximate
$9 million
effect on
2012
net income attributable to common stock. The LME spot copper price on
January 18, 2012
, was $3.70 per pound.
FCX defers recognizing profits on its sales from its Indonesia and South America mining operations to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of Indonesia's mining sales to PT Smelting (PT Freeport Indonesia's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit) until final sales to third parties occur. FCX's net deferred profits on its Indonesia and South America concentrate inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods' net income attributable to common stock totaled
$42 million
at
December 31, 2011
. Refer to the "Consolidated Statements of Income" on page IV for a summary of net impacts from changes in these deferrals. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices will result in variability in FCX's net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. Additionally, as PT Freeport Indonesia's operations return to full operating rates, FCX expects to defer a significant amount of PT Freeport Indonesia's profit on intercompany sales until final sales to third parties occur.
CASH FLOWS
FCX generated operating cash flows of
$746 million
for
fourth-quarter
2011
and
$6.6 billion
for the year
2011
. These amounts are net of working capital uses of
$335 million
for fourth-quarter
2011
and
$461 million
for the year
2011
.
Based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of
$3.50
per pound of copper,
$1,600
per ounce of gold and
$13
per pound of molybdenum, FCX's consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to approximate
$4.7 billion
for the year
2012
, net of working capital uses of $0.8 billion. The impact of price changes on operating cash flows would approximate
$150 million
for each
$0.05
per pound change in the average price of copper,
$50 million
for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold and
$90 million
for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.
Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled
$785 million
for
fourth-quarter
2011
and
$2.5 billion
for the year
2011
. FCX's capital expenditures are currently estimated to approximate
$4.0 billion
for the year
2012
, including
$2.4 billion
for major projects and
$1.6 billion
for sustaining capital. Major projects for
2012
primarily include underground development activities at Grasberg, the expansion at Tenke Fungurume and the concentrator expansion at Cerro Verde. FCX is also considering additional investments at several of its sites. Capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted in response to changes in market conditions and other factors.
CASH AND DEBT
At
December 31, 2011
, FCX had consolidated cash of
$4.8 billion
. Net of noncontrolling interests' share, taxes and other costs, cash available to the parent company totaled
$3.9 billion
as shown below (in billions):
a. Includes cash at FCX's parent company and North America operations.
    
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
                            
12
At
December 31, 2011
, FCX had
$3.5 billion
in debt. FCX had no borrowings and
$44 million
of letters of credit issued under its revolving credit facility resulting in total availability of
$1.5 billion
at
December 31, 2011
. Since January 1, 2009, FCX has repaid
$3.8 billion
in debt resulting in estimated annual interest savings of approximately
$260 million
based on current interest rates.
FCX does not have significant debt maturities in the near term (a total of $4 million through 2016); however, FCX may consider opportunities to prepay debt in advance of scheduled maturities. FCX has $3.0 billion in debt that is redeemable in whole or in part, at its option, at make-whole redemption prices prior to April 2012, and afterwards at stated redemption prices.
FINANCIAL POLICY
FCX has a long-standing tradition of seeking to build shareholder value through investing in projects with attractive rates of return and returning cash to shareholders through common stock dividends and share purchases. In addition to FCX's current annual common stock dividend of $1.00 per share ($0.25 per share quarterly), on June 1, 2011, FCX paid a supplemental common stock dividend of $0.50 per share. For the year
2011
, FCX paid common stock dividends of
$1.4 billion
, which includes $474 million for the supplemental dividend paid on June 1,
2011
. FCX intends to continue to maintain a strong financial position, invest aggressively in attractive growth projects and provide cash returns to shareholders. The Board will continue to review FCX's financial policy on an ongoing basis.

PRODUCT REVENUES AND PRODUCTION COSTS
PRODUCT REVENUES AND UNIT NET CASH COSTS
Unit net cash costs per pound of copper and molybdenum are measures intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of FCX's mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for the respective operations. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although FCX's measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
FCX presents gross profit per pound of copper in the following tables using both a by-product method and a co-product method. FCX uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (i) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (ii) it mines ore, which contains copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals, (iii) it is not possible to specifically assign all of FCX's costs to revenues from the copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals it produces, (iv) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (v) it is the method used by FCX's management and Board of Directors to monitor operations. In the co-product method presentations, shared costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent FCX's metals sales volumes and realized prices change.
FCX shows revenue adjustments for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because these adjustments do not result from current period sales, FCX has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and other costs consist of items such as stock-based compensation costs, write-offs of equipment and/or unusual charges. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs. As discussed above, gold, molybdenum and other metal revenues at copper mines are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. Following are presentations under both the by-product and co-product methods together with reconciliations to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.

FREEPORT-McMoRan COPPER & GOLD INC.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
FCX has organized its operations into five primary divisions - North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining, Africa mining and Molybdenum operations. Notwithstanding this structure, FCX internally reports information on a mine-by-mine basis. Therefore, FCX concluded that its operating segments include individual mines. Operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments, which are separately disclosed in the following table.
Intersegment Sales.
Intersegment sales between FCX's operations are based on similar arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums.
Allocations.
FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to the operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to a mine or operation are allocated. All U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level, whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country. In addition, most exploration and research activities are managed at the corporate level, and those costs along with some selling, general and administrative costs are not allocated to the operating divisions or segments. Accordingly, the following segment information reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity.
