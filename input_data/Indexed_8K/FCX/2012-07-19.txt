OPERATIONS
Consolidated.
Second-quarter
2012
consolidated sales of
927 million
pounds of copper and
266 thousand
ounces of gold were higher than the April
2012
estimates of
895 million
pounds of copper and
235 thousand
ounces of gold primarily reflecting higher copper sales volumes in North America and higher gold sales volumes in Indonesia, principally timing related.
Second-quarter
2012
consolidated sales were lower than second-quarter 2011 sales of
1.0 billion
pounds of copper and
356 thousand
ounces of gold primarily reflecting lower ore grades and production rates in Indonesia. Lower copper sales volumes also reflected lower ore grades in South America, partly offset by increased production in North America and Africa.
Operations and productivity at PT Freeport Indonesia have continued to improve following the first-quarter 2012 work interruptions in connection with efforts to resume normal operations. PT Freeport Indonesia's milling rates averaged
179,500
metric tons of ore per day in
second-quarter
2012
, compared with the first-quarter 2012 average of 114,800 metric tons of ore per day. Mining operations in the Grasberg open pit are approaching normal levels and underground mining operations at the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine continue to be ramped up following the 2011 work stoppages. Mining rates at the DOZ underground mine averaged 45,400 metric tons per day in second-quarter 2012 and are expected to reach 80,000 metric tons per day in fourth-quarter 2012.
Second-quarter
2012
consolidated molybdenum sales of
20 million
pounds approximated the April
2012
estimate of
20 million
pounds and
second-quarter
2011
sales of
21 million
pounds.
Consolidated sales from mines for the year
2012
are expected to approximate
3.6 billion
pounds of copper,
1.1 million
ounces of gold and
81 million
pounds of molybdenum, including
885 million
pounds of copper,
225 thousand
ounces of gold and
20 million
pounds of molybdenum in
third-quarter
2012
. FCX's revised 2012 estimates are lower than previous estimates reported in April by approximately 85 million pounds of copper and 60 thousand ounces of gold primarily because of mine sequencing changes and slower underground ramp-up at PT Freeport Indonesia and revisions to El Abra production.
As anticipated, consolidated average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) of
$1.49
per pound of copper in
second-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$0.93
per pound in
second-quarter
2011
primarily because of lower volumes in Indonesia, higher mining rates in North America and lower by-product credits.
Quarterly unit net cash costs will vary with fluctuations in sales volumes and average realized prices for gold and molybdenum. Assuming average prices of
$1,600
per ounce of gold and
$13
per pound of molybdenum
for the second half of
2012
and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for FCX's copper mining operations are expected to average approximately
$1.47
per pound of copper for the year
2012
. Projected unit net cash costs for 2012 are slightly higher than previous estimates reported in April primarily because of lower by-product credits. The impact of price changes
for the second half of
2012
on consolidated unit net cash costs would approximate
$0.01
per pound for each
$50
per ounce change in the average price of gold and
$0.01
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. Assuming consistent commodity price assumptions, unit net cash costs for 2013 are expected to be lower than 2012 because of projected increased copper and gold volumes at Grasberg.

North America Copper Mines.
FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America - Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Tyrone and Chino in New Mexico. All of the North America mining operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci. FCX records its 85 percent joint venture interest in Morenci using the proportionate consolidation method. In addition to copper, certain of FCX's North America copper mines (Sierrita, Bagdad, Morenci and Chino) also produce molybdenum concentrates.
Operating and Development Activities.
FCX has completed projects to increase production at its North America copper mines, including restarting milling operations and increasing mining rates at Morenci and Chino, and restarting the Miami mine. Ramp up activities at Chino are continuing, with annual production of approximately 250 million pounds of copper targeted in 2014. FCX continues to evaluate a number of opportunities to invest in additional production capacity at several of its North America copper mines. Exploration results in recent years indicate the potential for significant additional sulfide development in North America.
At Morenci, FCX completed a feasibility study to expand mining and milling capacity to process additional sulfide ores identified through exploratory drilling. The approximate $1.4 billion project would target incremental annual production of approximately 225 million pounds of copper in 2014 through an increase in milling rates from the current level of 50,000 metric tons of ore per day to approximately 115,000 metric tons of ore per day, and mining rates from the current level of 700,000 short tons per day to 900,000 short tons per day. FCX has commenced initial construction and engineering, and procurement activities are in progress.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the North America copper mines for the
second quarters
and
first six months of
2012
and
2011
:
Consolidated copper sales volumes from North America of
361 million
pounds in
second-quarter
2012
were higher than
second-quarter
2011
sales of
331 million
pounds primarily reflecting increased production at Chino and Safford.
FCX expects sales from the North America copper mines to approximate
1.3 billion
pounds of copper for the year
2012
, compared with
1.2 billion
pounds of copper in
2011
.
As anticipated, average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines of
$1.62
per pound of copper in
second-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$1.36
per pound in
second-quarter
2011
reflecting increased mining rates and lower molybdenum credits, partly offset by higher volumes.

FCX estimates that average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines would approximate
$1.65
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average molybdenum price of
$13
per pound
for the second half of
2012
. North America's average unit net cash costs for
2012
would change by approximately
$0.02
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of molybdenum
for the second half of
2012
.
South America Mining.
FCX operates four copper mines in South America - Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra, Candelaria and Ojos del Salado in Chile. FCX owns a 53.56 percent interest in Cerro Verde, a 51 percent interest in El Abra, and an 80 percent interest in both the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mining complexes. All operations in South America are consolidated in FCX's financial statements. South America mining includes open-pit and underground mining. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine produces molybdenum concentrates, and the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mines produce gold and silver.
    
Operating and Development Activities.
During 2011, FCX commenced production from El Abra's sulfide ores. Production from the sulfide ore is expected to approximate 300 million pounds of copper per year, replacing the currently depleting oxide copper production.
FCX is also engaged in pre-feasibility studies for a potential large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. Exploration results at El Abra indicate the potential for a significant sulfide resource. Exploration activities are continuing.
At Cerro Verde, plans for a large-scale concentrator expansion continue to be advanced. The approximate $4 billion project would expand the concentrator facilities from 120,000 metric tons of ore per day to 360,000 metric tons of ore per day and provide incremental annual production of approximately 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum beginning in 2016. An environmental impact assessment was filed in fourth-quarter 2011. Permitting is being advanced and engineering and procurement of long-lead items are in progress.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the South America mining operations for the
second quarters
and
first six months of
2012
and
2011
:

Copper sales from South America mining of
301 million
pounds in
second-quarter
2012
were lower than
second-quarter
2011
sales of
331 million
pounds primarily reflecting anticipated lower ore grades at Cerro Verde and Candelaria, partly offset by increased production at El Abra.
FCX expects South America's sales to approximate of
1.2 billion
pounds of copper and
100 thousand
ounces of gold for the year
2012
, compared with
2011
sales of
1.3 billion
pounds of copper and
101 thousand
ounces of gold. Copper sales estimates for South America are approximately 35 million pounds lower than previous estimates reported in April because of revisions to El Abra production.
As anticipated, average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America of
$1.49
per pound of copper in
second-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$1.08
per pound in
second-quarter
2011
, primarily reflecting lower copper sales volumes, lower by-product credits and increased mining costs.     
FCX estimates that average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America mining would approximate
$1.48
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of
$1,600
per ounce of gold and
$13
per pound of molybdenum
for the second half of
2012
.
Indonesia Mining.
Through its 90.64 percent owned and wholly consolidated subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia, FCX operates the world's largest copper and gold mine in terms of reserves at its Grasberg operations in Papua, Indonesia. PT Freeport Indonesia produces copper concentrates, which contain significant quantities of gold and also silver.
Operating and Development Activities.
FCX has several projects in progress in the Grasberg minerals district, primarily related to the development of the large-scale, high-grade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the Grasberg open pit. In aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to ramp up over several years to approximately 240,000 metric tons of ore per day following the currently anticipated transition from the Grasberg open pit in 2016. Over the next five years, estimated aggregate capital spending on these projects is expected to average $700 million per year ($550 million per year net to PT Freeport Indonesia). Considering the long-term nature and large size of these projects, actual costs could differ materially from these estimates.
    
The high-grade Big Gossan underground mine, which began producing in fourth-quarter 2010, is expected to reach full rates of 7,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2013. Substantial progress has been made in developing infrastructure and underground workings that will enable access to the underground ore bodies. Development of both the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep Mill Level Zone spurs is advancing, and the tunneling required to reach these underground ore bodies is complete.

Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Indonesia mining operations for the
second quarters
and
first six months of
2012
and
2011
:
Indonesia's
second-quarter
2012
copper sales of
183 million
pounds and gold sales of
247 thousand
ounces were significantly lower than
second-quarter
2011
copper sales of
265 million
pounds and gold sales of
330 thousand
ounces, primarily reflecting anticipated lower ore grades and production rates.
Operations and productivity at PT Freeport Indonesia have continued to improve following the first-quarter 2012 work interruptions in connection with efforts to resume normal operations. PT Freeport Indonesia's milling rates averaged
179,500
metric tons of ore per day in
second-quarter
2012
, compared with the first-quarter 2012 average of 114,800 metric tons of ore per day. Mining operations in the Grasberg open pit are approaching normal levels and underground mining operations at the DOZ underground mine continue to be ramped up following the 2011 work stoppages. Mining rates at the DOZ underground mine averaged 45,400 metric tons per day in second-quarter 2012 and are expected to reach 80,000 metric tons per day in fourth-quarter 2012.
At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing of mining areas with varying ore grades also causes fluctuations in the timing of ore production resulting in varying quarterly and annual sales of copper and gold. FCX expects sales from Indonesia to approximate
750 million
pounds of copper and
960 thousand
ounces of gold for the year
2012
, compared with
846 million
pounds of copper and
1.3 million
ounces of gold for the year
2011
. PT Freeport Indonesia's revised sales estimates for 2012 are lower than previous estimates reported in April by approximately 50 million pounds of copper and 60 thousand ounces of gold because of a deferral of access to high-grade material in the open pit to future periods and a slower than expected ramp-up of the DOZ underground mine. FCX expects sales from Indonesia to increase in 2013 as PT Freeport Indonesia gains access to higher ore grades.
Indonesia's unit net cash costs (including gold and silver credits) of
$1.37
per pound of copper in
second-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$0.22
per pound in
second-quarter
2011
primarily reflecting lower sales volumes.
Because of the fixed nature of a large portion of Indonesia's costs, unit costs vary from quarter to quarter depending on volumes of copper and gold sold, as well as average realized gold prices during the period. FCX estimates Indonesia's average unit net cash costs (net of gold and silver credits) would approximate
$1.24
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average gold price of
$1,600
per ounce
for the second half of
2012
. Projected unit net cash costs for 2012 are higher than
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
                            
7
previous estimates reported in April primarily because of lower copper sales volumes and lower by-product credits. Indonesia's unit net cash costs for
2012
would change by approximately
$0.04
per pound for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold
for the second half of
2012
. FCX expects Indonesia's unit net cash costs to decline significantly in future years, compared to the year 2012, because of higher projected copper and gold volumes.
Africa Mining.
Through its 56 percent owned and wholly consolidated subsidiary Tenke Fungurume Mining S.A.R.L (TFM), FCX operates the Tenke Fungurume (Tenke) mine in the Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In addition to copper, the Tenke mine produces cobalt hydroxide.
Operating and Development Activities.
The milling facilities at Tenke, which were designed to produce at a rate of 8,000 metric tons of ore per day, continue to perform above capacity, with throughput averaging
12,900
metric tons of ore per day in
second-quarter
2012
and
12,500
metric tons of ore per day for the
first six months of
2012
. Higher mining rates have increased copper production from the initial project capacity of 250 million pounds per year to approximately 290 million pounds per year.
FCX is constructing a second phase of the project, which would include optimizing the current plant and increasing capacity. FCX plans to expand the mill rate to 14,000 metric tons of ore per day and is constructing related processing facilities that would target the addition of approximately 150 million pounds of copper per year in 2013. The approximate $850 million project includes mill upgrades, additional mining equipment, a new tankhouse and a sulphuric acid plant expansion. Construction activities are progressing well and are expected to be completed by year-end 2012.
FCX continues to engage in drilling activities, exploration analyses and metallurgical testing to evaluate the potential of the highly prospective minerals district at Tenke. These analyses are being incorporated in future plans to evaluate opportunities for expansion. Future expansions are subject to a number of factors, including economic and market conditions, and the business and investment climate in the DRC.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Africa mining operations for the
second quarters
and
first six months of
2012
and
2011
:

Copper sales from Africa of
82 million
pounds in
second-quarter
2012
were higher than
second-quarter
2011
copper sales of
75 million
pounds primarily reflecting higher mining and milling rates.
FCX expects Africa's sales to approximate
310 million
pounds of copper and
25 million
pounds of cobalt for the year
2012
, compared with
283 million
pounds of copper and
25 million
pounds of cobalt for the year
2011
.    
Africa's unit net cash costs (net of cobalt credits) of
$1.22
per pound of copper in
second-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$0.94
per pound in
second-quarter
2011
primarily reflecting lower cobalt credits, partly offset by higher copper volumes.
FCX estimates Africa's average unit net cash costs would approximate
$1.16
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average cobalt price of
$12
per pound
for the second half of
2012
. Africa's unit net cash costs for
2012
would change by approximately
$0.06
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of cobalt
for the second half of
2012
.
Molybdenum.
FCX is the world's largest producer of molybdenum. FCX conducts molybdenum mining operations at its wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit mine in Colorado, and also sells molybdenum produced from its North and South America copper mines.
Development Activities.
Construction activities at the Climax molybdenum mine, which included the installation of a 25,400 metric ton per day mill facility, mining equipment and environmental management systems, is substantially complete. During second-quarter 2012, the operation began commercial production. Production from Climax is expected to ramp up to a rate of 20 million pounds of molybdenum per year during 2013 and, depending on market conditions, may be increased to 30 million pounds of molybdenum per year. FCX intends to operate the Climax and Henderson mines in a flexible manner to meet market requirements. FCX believes that Climax is one of the most attractive primary molybdenum mines in the world, with large-scale production capacity, attractive cash costs and future growth options.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Molybdenum operations for the
second quarters
and
first six months of
2012
and
2011
:
Consolidated molybdenum sales of
20 million
pounds in
second-quarter
2012
were slightly lower than
second-quarter
2011
sales of
21 million
pounds. For the year
2012
, FCX expects molybdenum sales to approximate
81 million
pounds (including production of approximately
42 million
pounds from the North and South America copper mines), compared with
79 million
pounds in
2011
(including production of
45 million
pounds from the North and South America copper mines).
Unit net cash costs at the Henderson mine of
$6.83
per pound of molybdenum in
second-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$6.21
per pound in
second-quarter
2011
primarily reflecting lower volumes.

Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, FCX expects average unit net cash costs for the Henderson mine to approximate
$7.00
per pound of molybdenum for the year
2012
.
EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES
FCX is actively conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves that will support the development of additional future production capacity in the large minerals districts where it currently operates. Exploration results indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North and South America and in the Tenke Fungurume minerals district. The drilling data in North America continue to indicate the potential for expanded sulfide production.
Exploration spending for the year
2012
is expected to approximate
$275 million
, compared to
$221 million
in
2011
. Exploration activities will continue to focus primarily on the potential for future reserve additions in FCX's existing minerals districts.
PROVISIONAL PRICING AND OTHER
For the
first six months of
2012
,
43 percent
of FCX's mined copper was sold in concentrate,
29 percent
as rod from North America operations and
28 percent
as cathode. Under the long-established structure of sales agreements prevalent in the industry, copper contained in concentrates and cathodes is provisionally priced at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalized in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted monthly average spot copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Because a significant portion of FCX's concentrate and cathode sales in any quarterly period usually remain subject to final pricing, the quarter-end forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenues and the average recorded copper price for the period. LME spot copper prices averaged
$3.57
per pound during
second-quarter
2012
, compared to FCX's average realized price of
$3.53
per pound.     
At
March 31, 2012
, FCX had provisionally priced copper sales at its copper mining operations, primarily South America and Indonesia, totaling
214 million
pounds (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average price of
$3.83
per pound. Lower prices during
second-quarter
2012
resulted in adjustments to these provisionally priced copper sales and unfavorably impacted
second-quarter
2012
consolidated revenues by
$75 million
(
$31 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.03
per share), compared with adjustments to the
March 31, 2011
, provisionally priced copper sales that unfavorably impacted
second-quarter
2011
consolidated revenues by
$47 million
(
$23 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.02
per share). Adjustments to the December 31, 2011, provisionally priced copper sales favorably impacted consolidated revenues by
$101 million
(
$43 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.05
per share) for the
first six months of
2012
, compared with adjustments to the December 31, 2010, provisionally priced copper sales that unfavorably impacted consolidated revenues by
$12 million
(
$5 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.01
per share) for the
first six months of
of
2011
.
At
June 30, 2012
, FCX had provisionally priced copper sales at its copper mining operations, primarily South America and Indonesia, totaling
329 million
pounds of copper (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average of
$3.49
per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. FCX estimates that each $0.05 change in the price realized from the
June 30, 2012
, provisional price recorded would have an approximate
$22 million
effect on its
2012
consolidated revenues (
$11 million
to net income attributable to common stock). The LME spot copper price closed at $3.45 per pound on

FCX defers recognizing profits on its sales from its Indonesia, South America, North America and Africa mining operations to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of Indonesia's mining sales to PT Smelting (PT Freeport Indonesia's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit) until final sales to third parties occur. FCX's net deferred profits on its Indonesia, South America and North America concentrate inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods' net income attributable to common stock totaled
$52 million
at
June 30, 2012
. Refer to the "Consolidated Statements of Income" on page IV for a summary of net impacts from changes in these deferrals. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices will result in variability in FCX's net deferred profits and quarterly earnings. As PT Freeport Indonesia's sales volumes increase in the second half of 2012, FCX expects to defer a significant amount of PT Freeport Indonesia's profit on intercompany sales until final sales to third parties occur.

CASH FLOWS
FCX generated operating cash flows of
$1.2 billion
for
second-quarter
2012
and
$2.0 billion
for the
first six months of
2012
. These amounts were net of working capital uses and other tax payments of
$54 million
for the
second quarter
and
$774 million
for the
six-month
period.
Based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of
$3.50
per pound of copper,
$1,600
per ounce of gold and
$13
per pound of molybdenum
for the second half of
2012
, FCX's consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to approximate
$4.0 billion
for the year
2012
(net of an estimated
$1.2 billion
in working capital uses and other tax payments). The impact of price changes
for the second half of
2012
on operating cash flows would approximate
$80 million
for each
$0.05
per pound change in the average price of copper,
$25 million
for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold and
$40 million
for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.
Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled
$840 million
for
second-quarter
2012
and
$1.5 billion
for the
first six months of
2012
. FCX's capital expenditures are currently estimated to approximate
$4.0 billion
for the year
2012
(including
$2.5 billion
for major projects and
$1.5 billion
for sustaining capital). Major projects for
2012
primarily include underground development activities at Grasberg and the expansion projects at Tenke, Cerro Verde and Morenci. FCX is also considering additional investments at several of its sites. Capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted in response to changes in market conditions and other factors.
CASH AND DEBT
At
June 30, 2012
, FCX had consolidated cash of
$4.5 billion
. Net of noncontrolling interests' share, taxes and other costs, cash available to the parent company totaled
$3.4 billion
as shown below (in billions):
a. Includes cash at FCX's parent company and North America operations.
At
June 30, 2012
, FCX had
$3.5 billion
in debt. FCX had no borrowings and
$44 million
of letters of credit issued under its revolving credit facility, resulting in total availability of approximately
$1.5 billion
at
June 30, 2012
.
In first-quarter 2012, FCX sold $3.0 billion of senior notes in three tranches with a weighted average interest rate of approximately three percent. FCX used the proceeds from this offering (plus cash on hand), to redeem the remaining $3.0 billion of its 8.375% Senior Notes. Annual interest cost savings associated with this refinancing approximates $160 million. Annual interest cost savings associated with this transaction and debt repayments since January 1, 2009, approximate $420 million per year, based on current interest rates.     
FINANCIAL POLICY
FCX has a long-standing tradition of seeking to build shareholder value through investing in projects with attractive rates of return and returning cash to shareholders through common stock dividends and share purchases. FCX's current annual dividend rate is $1.25 per share ($0.3125 per share quarterly). FCX paid common stock dividends of
$535 million
for the first six months of 2012. FCX intends to continue to maintain a strong financial position, invest aggressively in attractive growth projects and provide cash returns to shareholders. The Board will continue to review FCX's financial policy on an ongoing basis.

FCX cautions readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and its actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause FCX's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include commodity prices, mine sequencing, production rates, industry risks, regulatory changes, political risks, the outcome of ongoing discussions with the Indonesian government, the potential effects of violence in Indonesia, the resolution of administrative disputes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, weather- and climate-related risks, labor relations, environmental risks, litigation results, currency translation risks and other factors described in more detail under the heading "Risk Factors" in FCX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as updated by FCX's subsequent filings with the SEC.
Investors are cautioned that many of the assumptions on which FCX's forward-looking statements are based are likely to change after its forward-looking statements are made, including for example commodity prices, which FCX cannot control, and production volumes and costs, some aspects of which FCX may or may not be able to control. Further, FCX may make changes to its business plans that could or will affect its results. FCX cautions investors that it does not intend to update forward-looking statements more frequently than quarterly notwithstanding any changes in assumptions, changes in business plans, actual experience or other changes, and FCX undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
This press release also contains certain financial measures such as unit net cash costs per pound of copper and per pound of molybdenum.

PRODUCT REVENUES AND PRODUCTION COSTS
PRODUCT REVENUES AND UNIT NET CASH COSTS
Unit net cash costs per pound of copper and molybdenum are measures intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of FCX's mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for the respective operations. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although FCX's measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
FCX presents gross profit per pound of copper in the following tables using both a by-product method and a co-product method. FCX uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (i) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (ii) it mines ore, which contains copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals, (iii) it is not possible to specifically assign all of FCX's costs to revenues from the copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals it produces, (iv) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (v) it is the method used by FCX's management and Board of Directors to monitor operations. In the co-product method presentations, shared costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent FCX's metals sales volumes and realized prices change.
FCX shows revenue adjustments for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because these adjustments do not result from current period sales, FCX has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and other costs consist of items such as stock-based compensation costs, write-offs of equipment and/or unusual charges. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs. As discussed above, gold, molybdenum and other metal revenues at copper mines are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. Following are presentations under both the by-product and co-product methods together with reconciliations to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
FCX has organized its operations into five primary divisions - North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining, Africa mining and Molybdenum operations. Notwithstanding this structure, FCX internally reports information on a mine-by-mine basis. Therefore, FCX concluded that its operating segments include individual mines or operations. Operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments, which are separately disclosed in the following table.
Intersegment Sales.
Intersegment sales between FCX's operations are based on similar arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums.
Allocations.
FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to the operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to a mine or operation are allocated. All U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level, whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country. In addition, most exploration and research activities are managed at the corporate level, and those costs along with some selling, general and administrative costs are not allocated to the operating divisions or segments. Accordingly, the following segment information reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity.
