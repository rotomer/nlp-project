James R. Moffett, Chairman of the Board, and Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our global team continues to focus on execution of our plans to achieve efficient and safe production, effective cost management, investment in financially attractive projects and identification of additional reserves and resources. Our third quarter results reflect production growth in North America and Africa, offset by anticipated lower ore grades in Indonesia. As we look forward, we are on track to achieve meaningful increases in our production of copper as we return to higher grade ores at Grasberg and through the execution of brownfield expansions in the Americas and Africa, expected to add one billion pounds of copper annually over the next three years. We are positive about the long-term fundamentals of the metals we produce, our geographically diverse portfolio of large-scale operations with long-lived reserves and mineral resources and the strong track record of our team to execute our plans."
SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold

OPERATIONS
Consolidated.
Third-quarter
2012
consolidated copper sales of
922 million
pounds were higher than the July
2012
estimate of
885 million
pounds primarily reflecting higher production from North America and Africa and the timing of sales in South America.
Third-quarter
2012
consolidated gold sales of
202 thousand
ounces were lower than the July
2012
estimate of
225 thousand
ounces primarily because of changes to mine plans at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, which delayed access to higher grade material, and a slower than expected ramp-up at the Deep Ore Zone (DOZ) underground mine.
Third-quarter
2012
consolidated copper and gold sales were lower than third-quarter 2011 sales of
947 million
pounds of copper and
409 thousand
ounces of gold primarily reflecting lower ore grades in Indonesia, partly offset by increased sales in North America and Africa.
Third-quarter
2012
consolidated molybdenum sales of
21 million
pounds were higher than the July
2012
estimate of
20 million
pounds and
third-quarter
2011
sales of
19 million
pounds.
Consolidated sales from mines for the year
2012
are expected to approximate
3.6 billion
pounds of copper,
1.0 million
ounces of gold and
82 million
pounds of molybdenum, including
930 million
pounds of copper,
255 thousand
ounces of gold and
20 million
pounds of molybdenum for
fourth-quarter
2012
. Expected gold sales for
2012
are approximately 50,000 ounces less than the July 2012 estimates because of lower gold production at Grasberg.
As anticipated, consolidated average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) of
$1.62
per pound of copper in
third-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$0.80
per pound in
third-quarter
2011
primarily because of lower volumes in Indonesia (Indonesia unit net cash costs were
$1.65
per pound in
third-quarter
2012
, compared with a net credit of
$0.48
per pound in
third-quarter
2011
), lower by-product credits and higher mining costs.
Quarterly unit net cash costs will vary with fluctuations in sales volumes and average realized prices for gold and molybdenum. Assuming average prices of
$1,700
per ounce of gold and
$11
per pound of molybdenum
for fourth-quarter
2012
and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for FCX's copper mining operations are expected to average approximately
$1.50
per pound of copper for the year
2012
. The impact of price changes
for fourth-quarter
2012
on consolidated unit net cash costs would approximate
$0.004
per pound for each
$50
per ounce change in the average price of gold and
$0.004
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. Assuming consistent commodity price assumptions, unit net cash costs for 2013 are expected to be lower than 2012 because of projected increased copper and gold volumes at Grasberg.

North America Copper Mines.
FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America - Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Tyrone and Chino in New Mexico. All of the North America mining operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci. FCX records its 85 percent joint venture interest in Morenci using the proportionate consolidation method. In addition to copper, certain of FCX's North America copper mines (Sierrita, Bagdad, Morenci and Chino) also produce molybdenum concentrates.
Operating and Development Activities.
FCX has completed projects to increase production at its North America copper mines, including restarting certain mining and milling operations and increasing mining rates at Morenci and Chino. Ramp up activities at Chino are continuing, with annual production of approximately 250 million pounds of copper targeted in 2014. FCX continues to evaluate a number of opportunities to invest in additional production capacity at several of its North America copper mines. Exploration results in recent years indicate the potential for significant additional sulfide development in North America.
At Morenci, FCX is engaged in a project to expand mining and milling capacity to process additional sulfide ores identified through exploratory drilling. The approximate $1.4 billion project is targeting incremental annual production of approximately 225 million pounds of copper in 2014 through an increase in milling rates from the current level of 50,000 metric tons of ore per day to approximately 115,000 metric tons of ore per day and mining rates from the current level of 700,000 short tons per day to 900,000 short tons per day. FCX has received material permits and has commenced engineering and initial construction, and procurement activities are in progress.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the North America copper mines for the
third quarters
and
first nine months of
2012
and
2011
:
Consolidated copper sales volumes from North America of
331 million
pounds in
third-quarter
2012
were higher than
third-quarter
2011
sales of
307 million
pounds primarily reflecting increased production at the Chino mine.
FCX expects sales from the North America copper mines to approximate
1.3 billion
pounds of copper for the year
2012
, compared with
1.2 billion
pounds of copper in
2011
.
Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines of
$1.77
per pound of copper in
third-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$1.42
per pound in
third-quarter
2011
reflecting lower molybdenum credits and increased mining rates, partly offset by higher copper volumes.

FCX estimates that average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines would approximate
$1.67
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average molybdenum price of
$11
per pound
for fourth-quarter
2012
. North America's average unit net cash costs for
2012
would change by approximately
$0.01
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of molybdenum
for fourth-quarter
2012
.
South America Mining.
FCX operates four copper mines in South America - Cerro Verde in Peru and El Abra, Candelaria and Ojos del Salado in Chile. FCX owns a 53.56 percent interest in Cerro Verde, a 51 percent interest in El Abra, and an 80 percent interest in both the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mining complexes. All operations in South America are consolidated in FCX's financial statements. South America mining includes open-pit and underground mining. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine produces molybdenum concentrates, and the Candelaria and Ojos del Salado mines produce gold and silver.
    
Operating and Development Activities.
During 2011, FCX commenced production from El Abra's sulfide ores. Production from the sulfide ore is expected to approximate 300 million pounds of copper per year, replacing the currently depleting oxide copper production.
At Cerro Verde, FCX is engaged in a large-scale concentrator expansion. The approximate $4.4 billion project would expand the concentrator facilities from 120,000 metric tons of ore per day to 360,000 metric tons of ore per day and provide incremental annual production of approximately 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum beginning in 2016. An environmental impact assessment was filed in fourth-quarter 2011. Permitting is in an advanced stage and engineering and procurement of long-lead items is in progress. FCX expects to commence construction in 2013.
FCX is also engaged in pre-feasibility studies for a potential large-scale milling operation at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. Exploration results at El Abra indicate the potential for a significant sulfide resource.

Copper sales from South America mining of
308 million
pounds in
third-quarter
2012
were lower than
third-quarter
2011
sales of
322 million
pounds, primarily reflecting lower ore grades at Candelaria and timing of shipments.
FCX expects South America's sales to approximate
1.2 billion
pounds of copper and
95 thousand
ounces of gold for the year
2012
, compared with
2011
sales of
1.3 billion
pounds of copper and
101 thousand
ounces of gold.
Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America of
$1.55
per pound of copper in
third-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$1.15
per pound in
third-quarter
2011
, primarily reflecting higher mining and input costs, including energy, lower by-product credits and the timing of profit sharing.
FCX estimates that average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America mining would approximate
$1.50
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of
$1,700
per ounce of gold and
$11
per pound of molybdenum
for fourth-quarter
2012
.
Indonesia Mining.
Through its 90.64 percent owned and wholly consolidated subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia, FCX operates the world's largest copper and gold mine in terms of reserves at its Grasberg operations in Papua, Indonesia. PT Freeport Indonesia produces copper concentrates, which contain significant quantities of gold and also silver.
Operating and Development Activities.
FCX has several projects in progress in the Grasberg minerals district, primarily related to the development of the large-scale, high-grade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the Grasberg open pit. In aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to ramp up over several years to approximately 240,000 metric tons of ore per day following the currently anticipated transition from the Grasberg open pit in 2016. Substantial progress is being achieved to establish underground mine development and infrastructure required for large-scale underground operations. Development of both the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep Mill Level Zone is advancing. Access to these underground ore bodies is complete. Over the next five years, estimated aggregate capital spending on these projects is currently expected to average $700 million per year ($550 million per year net to PT Freeport Indonesia).
The high-grade Big Gossan underground mine, which began producing in fourth-quarter 2010, averaged
1,900
metric tons of ore per day in third-quarter 2012. Full rates of 7,000 metric tons of ore per day are expected in 2014.

Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Indonesia mining operations for the
third quarters
and
first nine months of
2012
and
2011
:
Indonesia's
third-quarter
2012
copper sales of
195 million
pounds and gold sales of
178 thousand
ounces were lower than
third-quarter
2011
copper sales of
253 million
pounds and gold sales of
384 thousand
ounces, primarily reflecting anticipated lower ore grades. Third-quarter 2012 sales volumes for copper were similar to the July estimates, but gold volumes were approximately 10 percent below the July estimates because of changes to mine plans that delayed access to higher grade material, and a slower than expected ramp-up at the DOZ underground mine. The DOZ mine averaged
48,300
metric tons of ore per day in
third-quarter
2012
and is expected to ramp up to 80,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2013. The slower than anticipated ramp-up reflects more extensive repairs required following the 2011 suspension of operations.
At the Grasberg mine, the sequencing of mining areas with varying ore grades also causes fluctuations in the timing of ore production resulting in varying quarterly and annual sales of copper and gold. FCX expects sales from Indonesia to approximate
0.7 billion
pounds of copper and
0.9 million
ounces of gold for the year
2012
, compared with
846 million
pounds of copper and
1.3 million
ounces of gold for the year
2011
. Indonesia's current sales estimates for 2012 are approximately 40 million pounds of copper and 45,000 ounces of gold lower than the July estimates because of mine plan changes in the Grasberg open pit, which delayed access to higher grade material, and a slower ramp-up of the DOZ mine. FCX expects sales from Indonesia to increase in the second half of 2013 as PT Freeport Indonesia gains access to higher ore grades.
Indonesia's unit net cash costs (including gold and silver credits) of
$1.65
per pound of copper in
third-quarter
2012
were significantly higher than unit net cash credits of
$0.48
per pound in
third-quarter
2011
primarily reflecting lower sales volumes.
Because of the fixed nature of a large portion of Indonesia's costs, unit costs vary from quarter to quarter depending on volumes of copper and gold sold, as well as average realized gold prices during the period. FCX estimates Indonesia's average unit net cash costs (net of gold and silver credits) would approximate
$1.34
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average gold price of
$1,700
per ounce
for fourth-quarter
2012
. Indonesia's unit net cash costs for
2012
would change by approximately
$0.02
per pound for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold
for fourth-quarter
2012
. Assuming consistent commodity price assumptions, Indonesia's unit net cash costs for future periods are expected to be lower than 2012, as PT Freeport Indonesia accesses higher grade ore beginning in the second half of 2013.

Africa Mining.
Through its 56 percent owned and wholly consolidated subsidiary Tenke Fungurume Mining S.A.R.L (TFM), FCX operates the Tenke Fungurume (Tenke) mine in the Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In addition to copper, the Tenke mine produces cobalt hydroxide.
Operating and Development Activities.
FCX is nearing completion of a second phase of the project, which includes optimizing the current plant and increasing capacity. FCX is expanding the mill rate to 14,000 metric tons of ore per day and is completing construction of the related processing facilities that target the addition of approximately 150 million pounds of copper per year in 2013. The approximate $850 million project includes mill upgrades, additional mining equipment, a new tankhouse and a sulphuric acid plant expansion. Construction activities are progressing well and are expected to be substantially complete by year-end 2012. The addition of a second sulphuric acid plant is expected to be completed in 2015.
During
third-quarter
2012
, Tenke achieved record mining, milling and copper production rates. Improved performance and the second phase expansion are expected to enable copper production to exceed
400 million
pounds for the year 2013, compared with initial design capacity of 250 million pounds per year.
FCX continues to engage in drilling activities, exploration analyses and metallurgical testing to evaluate the potential of the highly prospective minerals district at Tenke. These analyses are being incorporated in future plans to evaluate opportunities for expansion. Future expansions are subject to a number of factors, including economic and market conditions, and the business and investment climate in the DRC.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Africa mining operations for the
third quarters
and
first nine months of
2012
and
2011
:
Copper sales from Africa of
88 million
pounds in
third-quarter
2012
were higher than
third-quarter
2011
copper sales of
65 million
pounds primarily reflecting higher mining and milling rates principally related to the ramp-up of the second phase expansion.
FCX expects Africa's sales to approximate
330 million
pounds of copper and
25 million
pounds of cobalt for the year
2012
, compared with
283 million
pounds of copper and
25 million
pounds of cobalt for the year
2011
.

Africa's unit net cash costs (net of cobalt credits) of
$1.23
per pound of copper in
third-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$1.12
per pound in
third-quarter
2011
, primarily reflecting higher mining and input costs, including sulphuric acid and energy.
FCX estimates Africa's average unit net cash costs would approximate
$1.25
per pound of copper for the year
2012
, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average cobalt price of
$12
per pound
for fourth-quarter
2012
. Africa's unit net cash costs for
2012
would change by approximately
$0.025
per pound for each
$2
per pound change in the average price of cobalt
for fourth-quarter
2012
.
Molybdenum.
FCX is the world's largest producer of molybdenum. FCX conducts molybdenum mining operations at its wholly owned Henderson underground mine and Climax open-pit mine in Colorado, and also sells molybdenum produced from its North and South America copper mines.
Operating and Development Activities.
The newly commissioned Climax molybdenum mine, which includes a new 25,000 metric ton per day mill facility, began commercial production in May 2012. Depending on market conditions, production from Climax may ramp up to a rate of 20 million pounds of molybdenum per year during 2013, with potential to produce 30 million pounds of molybdenum per year. FCX intends to operate the Climax and Henderson mines in a flexible manner to meet market requirements. FCX believes that Climax is one of the most attractive primary molybdenum mines in the world, with large-scale production capacity, attractive cash costs and future growth options.
Operating Data.
Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Molybdenum operations for the
third quarters
and
first nine months of
2012
and
2011
:
Consolidated molybdenum sales of
21 million
pounds in
third-quarter
2012
were higher than
third-quarter
2011
sales of
19 million
pounds. For the year
2012
, FCX expects molybdenum sales to approximate
82 million
pounds (including production of approximately
43 million
pounds from the North and South America copper mines), compared with
79 million
pounds in
2011
(including production of
45 million
pounds from the North and South America copper mines).
Unit net cash costs at the Henderson mine of
$7.11
per pound of molybdenum in
third-quarter
2012
were higher than unit net cash costs of
$6.24
per pound in
third-quarter
2011
primarily reflecting lower volumes.     
Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, FCX expects average unit net cash costs for the Henderson mine to approximate
$7.00
per pound of molybdenum for the year
2012
.

EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES
FCX is actively conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves that will support the development of additional future production capacity in the large minerals districts where it currently operates. Exploration results indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North and South America and in the Tenke Fungurume minerals district. The drilling data in North America continue to indicate the potential for expanded sulfide production.
Exploration spending for the year
2012
is expected to approximate
$255 million
, compared to
$221 million
in
2011
. Exploration activities will continue to focus primarily on the potential for future reserve additions in FCX's existing minerals districts.
PROVISIONAL PRICING AND OTHER
For the
first nine months of
2012
,
45 percent
of FCX's mined copper was sold in concentrate,
28 percent
as cathode and
27 percent
as rod from North America operations. Under the long-established structure of sales agreements prevalent in the industry, copper contained in concentrates and cathodes is provisionally priced at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalized in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted monthly average spot copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Because a significant portion of FCX's concentrate and cathode sales in any quarterly period usually remain subject to final pricing, the quarter-end forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenues and the average recorded copper price for the period. LME spot copper prices averaged
$3.50
per pound during
third-quarter
2012
, compared to FCX's average realized price of
$3.64
per pound.     
At
June 30, 2012
, FCX had provisionally priced copper sales at its copper mining operations, primarily South America and Indonesia, totaling
329 million
pounds (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average price of
$3.49
per pound. Adjustments to these provisionally priced copper sales favorably impacted
third-quarter
2012
consolidated revenues by
$24 million
(
$12 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.01
per share), compared with adjustments to the
June 30, 2011
, provisionally priced copper sales that unfavorably impacted
third-quarter
2011
consolidated revenues by
$213 million
(
$100 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.11
per share). Adjustments to the December 31, 2011, provisionally priced copper sales favorably impacted consolidated revenues by
$101 million
(
$43 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.05
per share) for the
first nine months of
2012
, compared with adjustments to the December 31, 2010, provisionally priced copper sales that unfavorably impacted consolidated revenues by
$12 million
(
$5 million
to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.01
per share) for the
first nine months of
2011
.
At
September 30, 2012
, FCX had provisionally priced copper sales at its copper mining operations, primarily South America and Indonesia, totaling
325 million
pounds of copper (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average of
$3.72
per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. FCX estimates that each $0.05 change in the price realized from the
September 30, 2012
, provisional price recorded would have an approximate
$23 million
effect on its
2012
consolidated revenues (
$11 million
to net income attributable to common stock). The LME spot copper price closed at $3.68 per pound on
October 19, 2012
.
FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mining operations to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of Indonesia mining's sales to PT Smelting (PT Freeport Indonesia's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit) until final sales to third parties occur. FCX's net deferred profits on its inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods' net income attributable to common stock totaled
$105 million
at
September 30, 2012
. Refer to the "Consolidated Statements of Income" on page IV for a summary of net impacts from changes in these deferrals. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices will result in variability in FCX's net deferred profits and quarterly earnings.

CASH FLOWS
FCX generated operating cash flows of
$526 million
for
third-quarter
2012
and
$2.5 billion
for the
first nine months of
2012
. These amounts were net of working capital uses and other tax payments of
$765 million
for the
third quarter
and
$1.5 billion
for the
nine-month
period.
Based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of
$3.70
per pound of copper,
$1,700
per ounce of gold and
$11
per pound of molybdenum
for fourth-quarter
2012
, FCX's consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to approximate
$4.0 billion
for the year
2012
(net of an estimated
$1.4 billion
in working capital uses and other tax payments). The impact of price changes
for fourth-quarter
2012
on operating cash flows would approximate
$80 million
for each
$0.10
per pound change in the average price of copper,
$20 million
for each
$100
per ounce change in the average price of gold and
$10 million
for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.
Capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled
$971 million
for
third-quarter
2012
and
$2.5 billion
for the
first nine months of
2012
. FCX's capital expenditures are currently estimated to approximate
$3.6 billion
for the year
2012
(including
$2.2 billion
for major projects and
$1.4 billion
for sustaining capital). Major projects for
2012
primarily include underground development activities at Grasberg and the expansion projects at Tenke, Cerro Verde and Morenci. FCX is also considering additional investments at several of its sites. Capital spending plans will continue to be reviewed and adjusted in response to changes in market conditions and other factors.
CASH AND DEBT
At
September 30, 2012
, FCX had consolidated cash of
$3.7 billion
. Net of noncontrolling interests' share, taxes and other costs, cash available to the parent company totaled
$2.7 billion
as shown below (in billions):
a. Includes cash at FCX's parent company and North America operations.
At
September 30, 2012
, FCX had
$3.5 billion
in debt. FCX had no borrowings and
$44 million
of letters of credit issued under its revolving credit facility, resulting in total availability of approximately
$1.5 billion
at
September 30, 2012
.
Annual interest cost savings associated with debt repayments since January 1, 2009, including the first-quarter 2012 refinancing, approximates
$415 million
per year (based on current interest rates).     
FINANCIAL POLICY
FCX has a long-standing tradition of seeking to build shareholder value through investing in projects with attractive rates of return and returning cash to shareholders through common stock dividends and share purchases. FCX paid common stock dividends of
$832 million
during the
first nine months of
2012. FCX's current annual dividend rate for its common stock is $1.25 per share. On September 26, 2012, FCX's Board of Directors (the Board) declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.3125 per share, which will be paid on November 1, 2012. FCX intends to continue to maintain a strong financial position, invest aggressively in attractive growth projects and provide cash returns to shareholders. The Board will continue to review FCX's financial policy on an ongoing basis.

Cautionary Statement and Regulation G Disclosure:
This press release contains forward-looking statements in which FCX discusses its potential future performance. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as those statements regarding projected ore grades and milling rates, projected production and sales volumes, projected unit net cash costs, projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditures, exploration efforts and results, mine production and development plans, the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings, liquidity, other financial commitments and tax rates, the impact of copper, gold, molybdenum and cobalt price changes, future dividend payments and potential share purchases. The words "anticipates," "may," "can," "plans," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "intends," "likely," "will," "should," "to be," and any similar expressions are intended to identify those assertions as forward-looking statements. The declaration of dividends is at the discretion of FCX's Board of Directors (the Board) and will depend on FCX's financial results, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.
FCX cautions readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and its actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause FCX's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include commodity prices, mine sequencing, production rates, industry risks, regulatory changes, political risks, the outcome of ongoing discussions with the Indonesian government, the potential effects of violence in Indonesia, the resolution of administrative disputes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, weather- and climate-related risks, labor relations, environmental risks, litigation results, currency translation risks and other factors described in more detail under the heading "Risk Factors" in FCX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2011
, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as updated by FCX's subsequent filings with the SEC.
Investors are cautioned that many of the assumptions on which FCX's forward-looking statements are based are likely to change after its forward-looking statements are made, including for example commodity prices, which FCX cannot control, and production volumes and costs, some aspects of which FCX may or may not be able to control. Further, FCX may make changes to its business plans that could or will affect its results. FCX cautions investors that it does not intend to update forward-looking statements more frequently than quarterly notwithstanding any changes in assumptions, changes in business plans, actual experience or other changes, and FCX undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
This press release also contains certain financial measures such as unit net cash costs per pound of copper and per pound of molybdenum. As required by SEC Regulation G, reconciliations of these measures to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements are in the supplemental schedule, "Product Revenues and Production Costs," beginning on page VII, which is available on FCX's website, "www.fcx.com."

PRODUCT REVENUES AND PRODUCTION COSTS
PRODUCT REVENUES AND UNIT NET CASH COSTS
Unit net cash costs per pound of copper and molybdenum are measures intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of FCX's mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for the respective operations. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although FCX's measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
FCX presents gross profit per pound of copper in the following tables using both a by-product method and a co-product method. FCX uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (i) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (ii) it mines ore, which contains copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals, (iii) it is not possible to specifically assign all of FCX's costs to revenues from the copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals it produces, (iv) it is the method used to compare mining operations in certain industry publications and (v) it is the method used by FCX's management and Board of Directors to monitor operations. In the co-product method presentations, shared costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent FCX's metals sales volumes and realized prices change.
FCX shows revenue adjustments for prior period open sales as separate line items. Because these adjustments do not result from current period sales, FCX has reflected these separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and other costs consist of items such as stock-based compensation costs, start-up costs, write-offs of equipment and/or unusual charges. They are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash costs. As discussed above, gold, molybdenum and other metal revenues at copper mines are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. Following are presentations under both the by-product and co-product methods together with reconciliations to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
FCX has organized its operations into five primary divisions - North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining, Africa mining and Molybdenum operations. Notwithstanding this structure, FCX internally reports information on a mine-by-mine basis. Therefore, FCX concluded that its operating segments include individual mines or operations. Operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments, which are separately disclosed in the following table.
Intersegment Sales.
Intersegment sales between FCX's operations are based on similar arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums.
Allocations.
FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to the operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to a mine or operation are allocated. All U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level, whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country. In addition, most exploration and research activities are managed at the corporate level, and those costs along with some selling, general and administrative costs are not allocated to the operating divisions or segments. Accordingly, the following segment information reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity.
