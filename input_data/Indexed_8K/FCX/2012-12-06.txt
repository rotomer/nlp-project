PXP Merger Agreement
On December 5, 2012, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ("FCX") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "PXP Merger Agreement"), by and among Plains Exploration & Production Company, a Delaware corporation ("PXP"), FCX and IMONC LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of FCX ("PXP Merger Sub"), pursuant to which PXP will merge with and into PXP Merger Sub, with PXP Merger Sub surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of FCX (the "PXP Merger"). The PXP Merger Agreement has been approved by the board of directors of each of FCX and PXP, and was recommended to the board of directors of FCX by a special committee of independent directors.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the PXP Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the PXP Merger, PXP stockholders will have the right to receive, for each share of PXP common stock they own, 0.6531 shares of FCX common stock and $25.00 in cash, equivalent to total consideration of $50.00 per PXP share, based on the closing price of FCX common stock on December 4, 2012. PXP stockholders may elect to receive cash or stock consideration, subject to proration in the event of oversubscription, with the value of the cash and stock per-share consideration to be equalized at closing. No fractional shares of FCX common stock will be issued in the PXP Merger, and PXP stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of FCX common stock.
Pursuant to the terms of the PXP Merger Agreement, each restricted share of PXP common stock outstanding and each stock-settled PXP restricted stock unit outstanding and granted or contractually promised as of the date of the PXP Merger Agreement (the "PXP RSUs") (except for certain PXP RSUs held by each of PXP's named executive officers identified below) will become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder, cash consideration or stock consideration, subject to proration as described above. Certain stock-settled PXP RSUs held by each of PXP's named executive officers as of the date of the PXP Merger Agreement will become fully vested and will be converted into the right to receive cash consideration or stock consideration, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in certain letter agreements among each such named executive officer, FCX and PXP, which are described in further detail below. Each cash-settled PXP RSU will become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive cash consideration. Each stock appreciation right relating to shares of PXP common stock outstanding and unexercised will become fully vested and be converted into a stock appreciation right relating to shares of FCX common stock as described in the PXP Merger Agreement. Each compensatory equity award granted or issued by PXP after the date of the PXP Merger Agreement and prior to the effective time of the PXP Merger will be converted into the same type of award covering shares of FCX common stock as described in the PXP Merger Agreement, with the same terms and conditions as prior to the effective time.
Consummation of the PXP Merger is subject to the approval of PXP's stockholders. In addition, the PXP Merger is subject to other customary closing conditions, including expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Each party's obligations to complete the PXP Merger is also subject to the accuracy of representations and warranties of, and compliance with covenants by, the other party, in each case as set forth in the PXP Merger Agreement.
FCX and PXP have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the PXP Merger Agreement, including, among other things, covenants by PXP (i) with respect to the conduct of its business during the interim period between the execution of the PXP Merger Agreement and consummation of the PXP Merger and (ii) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period. PXP has also agreed not to directly or indirectly solicit competing acquisition proposals or, subject to certain exceptions with respect to unsolicited proposals, to enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, any alternative business combinations.
The PXP Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both FCX and PXP, including, but not limited to, in the event that (i) the PXP Merger is not consummated by June 5, 2013 (subject to extension by either party up to September 5, 2013 if all conditions other than those related to regulatory approvals and the absence of injunctions have been satisfied), (ii) PXP's stockholders do not adopt the PXP Merger Agreement, (iii) an injunction permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the PXP Merger becomes final and nonappealable, (iv) either party breaches its obligations or representations in a manner that cannot be cured by the termination date of the PXP Merger Agreement, or (v) PXP changes its recommendation to stockholders to adopt the PXP Merger Agreement or breaches its agreement not to solicit alternative transactions. The PXP Merger Agreement further provides that, upon termination of the PXP Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, PXP would be required to pay FCX a termination fee of $207 million or up to $69 million in reimbursement of FCX's transaction expenses.
MMR Merger Agreement
On December 5, 2012, FCX entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "MMR Merger Agreement"), by and among McMoRan Exploration Co., a Delaware corporation ("MMR"), FCX and INAVN Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of FCX ("MMR Merger Sub"), pursuant to which MMR Merger Sub will merge with and into MMR, with MMR surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of FCX (the "MMR Merger"). The MMR Merger Agreement has been approved by the board of directors of each of FCX and MMR, and was recommended to the respective board of directors of each of MMR and FCX by a special committee of independent directors.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the MMR Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the MMR Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of MMR will be converted into the right to receive $14.75 in cash, without interest, and 1.15 units of a royalty trust to be created prior to the closing of the MMR Merger that will be entitled to a 5% gross overriding royalty interest in hydrocarbons produced from certain MMR shallow water, ultra deep Gulf of Mexico prospects. No fractional royalty trust units will be issued in the MMR Merger, and MMR stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional units, if any.
Pursuant to the terms of the MMR Merger Agreement, each outstanding and unexercised MMR stock option as of the closing of the MMR Merger will convert into a stock option relating to shares of FCX common stock on the same terms and conditions as the MMR stock option immediately prior to closing , adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio between the trading price of MMR common stock and FCX common stock. Each outstanding restricted stock unit of MMR as of the closing of the MMR Merger will convert into an RSU relating to FCX common stock, adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio between the trading price of MMR common stock and FCX common stock, with each adjusted RSU subject to the same terms and conditions as the MMR RSU prior to closing. Each other equity-based right, whether contingent or accrued, to receive shares of MMR common stock (or cash based on the value of a number of shares granted under a MMR deferred compensation plan outstanding immediately prior to the closing), other than options or RSUs outstanding at the closing of the MMR Merger will, as
of closing, be converted into the right to receive (or to be credited with) such number of shares of, or other payments based on, FCX common stock, adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio between the trading price of MMR common stock and FCX common stock and subject to the same terms and conditions as the MMR award prior to closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, concurrently with the execution of the MMR Merger Agreement, each of the executive officers of MMR waived his or her contractual right to accelerated vesting as a result of the MMR Merger.
Consummation of the MMR Merger is subject to the approval of the MMR Merger Agreement by MMR's stockholders, both by (i) a majority of the outstanding shares of MMR common stock (the "MMR Merger Approval") and (ii) a majority of the outstanding shares of MMR common stock, excluding shares owned by FCX and its subsidiaries, PXP and its subsidiaries, and certain officers and/or directors of MMR and FCX (the "Disinterested Stockholder Approval"), and the approval by a majority of the outstanding shares of MMR common stock of an amendment to MMR's certificate of incorporation to exempt FCX from certain interested stockholder provisions (the "Charter Amendment Approval" and together with the MMR Merger Approval and the Disinterested Stockholder Approval, the "MMR Stockholder Approval"). In addition, the MMR Merger is subject to other customary closing conditions, including expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Each party's obligation to complete the MMR Merger is also subject to the accuracy of representations and warranties of, and compliance with covenants by, the other party, in each case as set forth in the MMR Merger Agreement.
FCX and MMR have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the MMR Merger Agreement, including, among other things, covenants by MMR (i) with respect to the conduct of its business during the interim period between the execution of the MMR Merger Agreement and consummation of the MMR Merger and (ii) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period. MMR has also agreed not to directly or indirectly solicit competing acquisition proposals or, subject to certain exceptions with respect to unsolicited proposals, to enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, any alternative business combinations.
The MMR Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both FCX and MMR, including, but not limited to, in the event that (i) the MMR Merger is not consummated by June 5, 2013 (subject to extension by either party up to September 5, 2013 if all conditions other than those related to regulatory approvals and the absence of injunctions have been satisfied), (ii) the MMR Stockholder Approval is not obtained, (iii) an injunction permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the MMR Merger becomes final and nonappealable, (iv) either party breaches its obligations or representations in a manner that cannot be cured by the termination date of the MMR Merger Agreement, or (v) MMR changes its recommendation to stockholders to adopt the MMR Merger Agreement. The MMR Merger Agreement further provides that, upon termination of the MMR Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, MMR would be required to pay FCX a termination fee of $98 million or up to $19.5 million in reimbursement of FCX's transaction expenses.
Each of the above merger agreements contains representations and warranties that the parties have made to each other as of specific dates. Except for their status as contractual documents that establish and govern the legal relations among the parties to the respective merger agreements described therein, the merger agreements are not intended to be a source of factual, business or operational information about any of the parties thereto. The representations and warranties contained in each merger agreement were made only for purposes of those agreements and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such merger agreements, and may be subject to limitations agreed between those parties, including being qualified by disclosures between those parties. The representations and warranties in each merger agreement may have been made to allocate risks among
the parties thereto, including where the parties do not have complete knowledge of all facts, instead of establishing matters as facts. Furthermore, those representations and warranties may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. The assertions embodied in such representations and warranties are qualified by information contained in disclosure schedules to each of the merger agreements that the parties exchanged in connection with the execution of the merger agreements. Accordingly, investors and security holders should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances, since they were only made as of the date of each of the merger agreements and are modified in important part by the underlying disclosure letters. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of such representations and warranties may change after the date of each respective merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in FCX's, PXP's or MMR's public disclosures.
Voting and Support Agreement
On December 5, 2012, FCX, MMR and PXP entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the "Support Agreement") with respect to the MMR Merger, which generally requires that PXP, in its capacity as a stockholder of MMR, vote all of its shares of MMR common stock in favor of the MMR Merger and the related amendment to the MMR certificate of incorporation and against alternative transactions and generally prohibits PXP from transferring its shares of MMR common stock prior to the consummation of the MMR Merger. The Support Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the consummation of the MMR Merger, (ii) the termination of the MMR Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, or (iii) any breach by FCX of its obligations under the PXP Merger Agreement not to change the merger consideration or materially amend any material provision of the MMR Merger Agreement or terminate the MMR Merger Agreement, without the prior written consent of PXP.
The PXP Merger Agreement, the MMR Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1, Exhibit 2.2 and Exhibit 10.1, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. The descriptions of the PXP Merger Agreement, the MMR Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement set forth above do not purport to be complete and each is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the PXP Merger Agreement, the MMR Merger Agreement, and the Support Agreement as applicable.
 
On December 5, 2012, each of PXP's named executive officers, including James C. Flores (Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer), Doss R. Bourgeois (Executive Vice President, Exploration & Production), Winston M. Talbert (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) and John F. Wombwell (Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary) (collectively, the "PXP NEOs") entered into a letter agreement with PXP and FCX (collectively, the "Letter Agreements") which generally provides that FCX will assume the current employment agreement between each of the PXP NEOs and PXP, subject to the amendment and the executive's waiver of certain provisions thereof and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Letter Agreement. Except as provided in the applicable Letter Agreement, the terms of the current employment agreement between PXP and each of Messrs. Flores, Bourgeois, Talbert and Wombwell otherwise remain unchanged.
Mr. Flores' Letter Agreement provides that he will serve as the Vice-Chairman of FCX and Chief Executive Officer of the oil and gas business of FCX and as a member of the board of directors of
FCX. Mr. Flores' annual base salary will be no less than the annual base salary applicable to each of the current Chairman of FCX and the current President and Chief Executive Officer of FCX, as in effect from time to time. Mr. Flores is eligible for an annual incentive award based on an annual target incentive opportunity that is the same as applicable to peer executives of FCX, and participation in incentive compensation and benefit plans applicable to the peer executives of FCX. Mr. Flores' Letter Agreement provides that he will waive his right to resign from employment with PXP and receive severance payments or benefits as a result of or in connection with the PXP Merger (including changes to existing employment arrangements) under his current employment agreement with PXP and for purposes of all arrangements which contain any such right or commitments. In addition, Mr. Flores has agreed to take 100% stock consideration in settlement of the stock-settled RSUs that accelerate as a result of the PXP Merger.
The Letter Agreements with each of Messrs. Bourgeois, Talbert and Wombwell provide that the executive will serve as Executive Vice President, oil and gas business of FCX. These Letter Agreements provide each of Messrs. Bourgeois, Talbert and Wombwell with the annual base salary to which such individual is currently entitled, eligibility for an annual incentive award as determined by the compensation committee of FCX, and participation in incentive compensation and benefit plans of FCX that are applicable to similarly situated executives of FCX. These Letter Agreements provide that each of Messrs. Bourgeois, Talbert and Wombwell will waive his right to resign from employment with PXP and receive severance payments or benefits in connection with or as a result of the PXP Merger (including changes to existing employment arrangements) under the executive's current employment agreement with PXP and for purposes of all arrangements which contain any similar right or commitments. In addition, Messrs. Bourgeois, Talbert and Wombwell have each agreed to take no less than 75% stock consideration in settlement of the stock-settled RSUs that accelerate as a result of the PXP Merger.
Pursuant to the Letter Agreements, Shares of FCX common stock delivered to each of the PXP NEOs in settlement of certain accelerated restricted stock units will be subject to a holding requirement from the closing date of the Merger through the third anniversary thereof, subject to certain permitted transfers and termination of such holding requirement upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth therein.
The foregoing summary of the Letter Agreements does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, reference to the full text of the Letter Agreements, which are filed as Exhibit 10.2, Exhibit 10.3, Exhibit 10.4 and Exhibit 10.5 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
 
On December 5, 2012, FCX entered into commitment letters ("Commitment Letters") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (together, "JP Morgan"). JP Morgan has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters, to provide FCX with senior unsecured 364-day bridge facilities (collectively, "Facilities") under which an aggregate principal amount of up to $9.5 billion will be made available to FCX to finance the transactions contemplated by the PXP Merger Agreement and the MMR Merger Agreement upon the closings thereof. Each of the Facilities will mature 364 days from the date of the first borrowing thereunder. Borrowings under each of the Facilities will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin based on FCX's credit rating. JP Morgan's financing commitments under the Commitment Letter are subject to certain customary conditions.

Houston, Texas 77002
Dear Jim:
Reference is made to the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ("Freeport"), Plains Exploration & Production Company ("Plains") and IMONC LLC ("Merger Sub"), to be executed concurrently with this letter agreement (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Plains will merge into Merger Sub and become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Freeport (the "Merger"). The parties acknowledge that in the event that the Merger is not consummated, this letter agreement will become null and void and of no further force and effect.
ab initio
Following the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement), you will be appointed the Vice-Chairman of Freeport and Chief Executive Officer of the oil and gas business of Freeport, with sole oversight of the oil and gas businesses and operations of Freeport, with the duties, authorities and responsibilities commensurate with such titles and offices and such other duties and responsibilities as reasonably may be assigned to you by the Chairman of Freeport commensurate with that position, and you will initially be appointed (and thereafter be nominated) to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of Freeport. During your employment with Freeport, you will report directly to the Chairman of Freeport, you will receive an annual base salary that is no less than the annual base salary applicable to each of the current Chairman of Freeport and the current President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport (the "peer executives"), as in effect from time to time (currently $2,500,000), you will be eligible for an annual incentive award based on an annual target incentive opportunity that is the same as the annual target incentive opportunity applicable to the peer executives as determined by the Compensation Committee of Freeport, and you will be eligible to participate in all incentive compensation, savings, welfare benefit and fringe benefit plans and arrangements and any retirement plan or arrangement adopted in the future (which in all cases excludes the current supplemental executive retirement plan in which the peer executives participate), in each case applicable to the peer executives, as in effect from time to time.
In consideration for the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, including the payment of the Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for your wholly owned shares of Plains common stock as of the Closing Date, you agree to waive your right to resign from Plains (or any successor entity, including Freeport) for Good Reason (as defined in your amended and restated employment agreement with Plains, dated as of June 9, 2004, as amended on October 30, 2007 (the "Employment Agreement")) or otherwise claim breach of the Employment Agreement solely (A) as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 6(e)(vi) of the Employment Agreement, (B) pursuant to clause (iv) of Section 6(e) of the Employment Agreement due to the principal executive offices of Freeport being outside the greater Houston, Texas metropolitan area or your being located somewhere other than Freeport's principal executive offices, it being agreed that your principal office shall be located in Houston, Texas or (C) pursuant to Section 3 and/or clauses (i) and (v) (with respect to committee membership) of Section 6(e) of the Employment Agreement due to your not being the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of Freeport or serving in any other position at Plains or its affiliates or on any committee existing at Plains or its affiliates,
which waivers shall apply to all arrangements and agreements which contain any such right or commitments, including, without limitation, any Company Stock Plans (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (and the related award agreements), the Amended and Restated Long-Term Retention and Deferral Agreement and the Plains Executives' Long-Term Retention & Deferred Compensation Plan (and any successor or predecessor plans or agreements). For the avoidance of doubt, you shall retain the Good Reason protections set forth in the Employment Agreement; ; , that none of the changes to your employment arrangements contemplated by the waivers or other terms or arrangements set forth in this letter agreement shall contribute to or constitute Good Reason.
provided
however
Furthermore, the parties agree that the Merger will constitute a Change in Control (as defined in the Company Stock Plans) for purposes of the Company Stock Plans (and related award agreements), the Amended and Restated Long-Term Retention and Deferral Agreement, the Plains Executives' Long-Term Retention & Deferred Compensation Plan and your Employment Agreement, and pursuant to such plans and agreements, subject to the occurrence of the Closing Date, the stock-settled equity-based awards set forth on to this letter agreement (the "Vesting Equity Awards") will immediately vest (including the deferred restricted stock unit awards for which Plains has a contractual commitment to credit in the future) and for the purposes of the Merger Agreement such Vesting Equity Awards will be "Company Non-Electing RSUs" and will be paid in shares of Freeport common stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement. You agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Company Stock Plan, award agreement or any other agreement or arrangement, the shares of Freeport common stock delivered to you in settlement of the Vesting Equity Awards will be subject to a holding requirement from the Closing Date through the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Holding Period"); , , that, at your election, the number of shares delivered in settlement of your Vesting Equity Awards will be reduced as necessary in order to satisfy your income and employment tax liabilities with respect to such delivery at an individual Federal income tax withholding rate based on a reasonable estimate of the tax rate applicable to you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) during the Holding Period you will have the right to transfer shares of Freeport common stock for estate or charitable planning purposes to any person who would be a permitted transferee of Freeport equity awards if they were to be registered on Form S-8 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission; that the transfer restrictions on such shares will continue to apply to such permitted transferees through the end of the Holding Period and (ii) the Holding Period will immediately terminate upon a "Change of Control" of Freeport as defined in Freeport's Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer dated as of December 2, 2008 or if your employment with Freeport is terminated (A) by you for Good Reason (as defined in your Employment Agreement taking into account the waivers set forth above and other terms and arrangements of this letter agreement), (B) by Freeport without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or (C) due to your death or disability.

You and Freeport agree that so long as you and each of Plains' three current executive vice presidents are employed by Plains or any affiliate of Freeport, each of them shall report directly and exclusively to you, except if you determine that any such executive vice president shall cease reporting to you.

("Freeport"), Plains Exploration & Production Company ("Plains") and IMONC LLC ("Merger Sub"), to be executed concurrently with this letter agreement (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Plains will merge into Merger Sub and become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Freeport (the "Merger"). The parties acknowledge that in the event that the Merger is not consummated, this letter agreement will become null and void and of no further force and effect.

Following the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement), you will be Executive Vice President of the oil and gas business of Freeport, with such customary duties and responsibilities as may be assigned to you by James C. Flores commensurate with such position and you will report directly to Mr. Flores. During your employment with Freeport you will receive an annual base salary that is no less than $750,000 and you will be eligible for an annual incentive award determined by the Compensation Committee of Freeport. Following the Closing Date, you will be eligible to participate in incentive compensation, savings, welfare benefit and fringe benefit plans and arrangements applicable to similarly situated executives of Freeport, as in effect from time to time.
In consideration for the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, including the payment of the Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for your wholly owned shares of Plains common stock as of the Closing Date, you agree to waive your right to resign from your employment with Plains (or any successor entity, including Freeport) and receive payments or benefits under your amended and restated employment agreement with Plains, dated as of November 8, 2006, as amended on November 20, 2007 (the "Employment Agreement")) or otherwise claim breach of the Employment Agreement (A) for any reason as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii) and Section 6(c)(iv) of the Employment Agreement, (B) for any reason because (x) James C. Flores ceases to be the Chief Executive Officer or (y) you are no longer reporting directly to Mr. Flores, in each case pursuant to Section 6(c)(ii) of the Employment Agreement or (C) pursuant to clause (iv) of Section 6(j) of the Employment Agreement due to the principal executive offices of Freeport being outside the greater Houston, Texas metropolitan area or your being located somewhere other than Freeport's principal executive offices, it being agreed that your principal office shall be located in Houston, Texas, which waivers shall apply to all arrangements and agreements which contain any similar rights or commitments, including, without limitation, any Company Stock Plans (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (and the related award agreements). If, following the Closing Date, (A) your employment is terminated by Freeport other than for Cause or Disability (each as defined in the Employment Agreement), (B) you terminate your employment for Good Reason (within the meaning of Section 6(j) of the Employment Agreement; , , that none of the terms and conditions of your employment arrangement contemplated by, or the waivers set forth in, this letter agreement shall contribute to or constitute Good Reason) or (C) you terminate

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) during the Holding Period you will have the right to transfer shares of Freeport common stock for estate or charitable planning purposes to any person who would be a permitted transferee of Freeport equity awards if they were to be registered on Form S-8 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission; that the transfer restrictions on such shares will continue to apply to such permitted transferees through the end of the Holding Period and (ii) the Holding Period will immediately terminate upon a "Change of Control" of Freeport as defined in Freeport's Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement with its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer dated as of December 2, 2008 or if your employment with Freeport is terminated (A) by you for Good Reason (as defined in your Employment Agreement taking into account the waivers and other terms and arrangements of this letter agreement), (B) by Freeport without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or (C) due to your death or disability.
