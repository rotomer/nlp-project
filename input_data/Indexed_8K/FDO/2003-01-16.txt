(b)
The Board shall add such conditions and limitations to any Award to any Participant who is subject to Section 16(a) and 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as is necessary to comply with Section 16(a) or 16(b) and the rules and regulations thereunder or to obtain any exemption therefrom.

Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), announced that Howard R. Levine, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, has been named Chairman of the Board. He succeeds his father, Leon Levine, the founder of the Company who is retiring at age 65.
        Howard R. Levine, age 44, initially was employed by the Company from 1981 to 1987. He rejoined the Company in April 1996 and was named President and Chief Operating Officer in April 1997 and President and Chief Executive Officer in August 1998. In making the announcement, Leon Levine, who will hold the title of "Founder and Chairman Emeritus", stated that: "Howard has been involved with Family Dollar from his early years and the experience he has gained makes him uniquely qualified to succeed me as Chairman of the Board. With this experience the transition is now complete, and I am confident that he, together with the outstanding management team we have in place and more than 39,000 dedicated Associates, will continue to build upon our Company's record of profitable growth. When I opened the first Family Dollar store more than 43 years ago, I never could have imagined that all of us would achieve so much together. I have had a full and rewarding career with Family Dollar. It has been an extraordinary journey, and now as Founder and Chairman Emeritus I look forward to following what I know will be continued success for our Company."
        Howard R. Levine stated that: "Leon Levine is one of the giants of the retail discount industry. Since he opened the first Family Dollar store in 1959, he has been our leader in building one of the fastest growing and most profitable retail chains in the country. He also is my Dad. From the time I was old enough to remember he took me on many business trips and he gave me invaluable life lessons that I carry today. All of us at Family Dollar will be forever grateful to him for his vision, his leadership and his dedication to the success of our Company."

During this period, David has assumed increasing responsibilities, and his efforts have been instrumental in producing such outstanding results. David's leadership ability is a great asset to our Company, and I am delighted that he is succeeding me as President."
