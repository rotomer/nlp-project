MATTHEWS, NC, March 19, 2003 - Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), a discount store chain operating 4,758 stores in 42 states, reported the highest sales and earnings for any second quarter and first half in the Company's history.  For the second quarter ended March 1, 2003, sales were $1,256.2 million, or 13.7% above sales of $1,105.2 million for the second quarter ended March 2, 2002.  Net income was $ 72.7 million, or 14.0% above net income of $63.8 million for the second quarter of the prior fiscal year, and net income per diluted share increased to $.42 from $.37.
 
For the two quarters ended March 1, 2003, sales were $2,364.8 million, or 13.6% above sales of $2,082.3 million for the two quarters ended March 2, 2002. Net income for the two quarters ended March 1, 2003, was $130.2 million, or
14.2% above net income of $114.0 million for the two quarters ended March 2, 2002, and net income per diluted share increased to $.75 from $.66.
 
The sales gains are attributable to increased sales in existing stores and to sales recorded in new stores opened in the Company's store expansion program.  Sales in existing stores in the second quarter ended March 1, 2003, increased approximately 2.9% above the second quarter last year, including increases of approximately 3.5% in sales of hardlines and approximately 0.8% in sales of softlines.  The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in existing stores, was at approximately the same level and the average transaction increased approximately 2.6% to $9.42.  During the second

quarter ended March 1, 2003, the Company opened 88 stores and closed 13 stores, compared to the opening of 76 stores and the closing of 14 stores during the second quarter last year.
 
Sales in existing stores in the two quarters ended March 1, 2003, increased approximately 3.0% above the comparable period last year, including increases of approximately 3.4% in sales of hardlines and approximately 1.8% in sales of softlines.  The customer count increased approximately 0.2% and the average transaction increased approximately 2.6% to $9.07.  During the two quarters ended March 1, 2003, the Company opened 179 stores and closed 42 stores, compared to the opening of 201 and closing of 43 stores during the first two quarters last year.
 
In commenting on the operating results, Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, noted that the 14.0% increase in net income in the second quarter ended March 1, 2003, was the 28 consecutive quarter in which net income had increased above the prior comparable quarter.  The earnings increase in the second quarter was achieved in a retail sales environment that was impacted by concerns about the economy, war and terrorism, and severe winter weather.  In the second quarter sales of core basic consumable goods continued to be strong.  Expenses as a percent to sales increased from 23.9% in the second quarter last year to 24.1% in the second quarter this year.  The increase in expenses, including rising energy and insurance costs, was offset in the second quarter by an increase from 33.0% to 33.2% in the gross profit margin as a percent to sales.  The favorable impact of supply chain initiatives contributed to this increase.  The Company's inventories at the end of the second quarter this year were in a good position, with per store inventories at about the same level as at the end of the second quarter last year.  With the current economic uncertainties, the Company continues to plan its sales of seasonal goods conservatively.
th
The Company also announced that it has revised its store expansion plans for the fiscal year ending August 30, 2003.  Originally the plan was to open approximately 575 stores and close approximately 50 stores.  The current plan is to open 475 to 500 stores and close approximately 65 stores.  In the last two years, the Company's traditional opportunistic approach to locating potential new sites has become more strategic with the objective of improving new store performance.  With this approach and better site selection processes, approximately 60% of new stores are targeted to open in urban markets in fiscal 2003.  The time it is taking to open new stores in urban markets, including time for the permitting process and the completion of leasehold improvements and new construction, is substantially longer than the time for opening stores in non-urban markets.  With the large number of approved locations currently being processed, by this summer the Company expects to be opening stores at a run rate that will again support its targeted 10% to 12% net new store growth.
 
For the second half of the fiscal year ending August 30, 2003, the Company confirmed that its plan is for net income per diluted share of Common Stock to increase approximately 14% to 16%.  The adverse impact of the reduction in new stores in fiscal 2003 is expected to be offset by benefits from supply chain initiatives, cost controls and the stronger than planned sales performance of new stores opening this fiscal year.  The Company is realizing its objective of improving new store performance as for the first half of fiscal 2003, the sales performance of new stores was equal to more than 90% of the chain average store sales.
 
The Company also continues to plan for sales in existing stores in the second half of fiscal 2003 to increase in the 3% to 5% range.  As previously reported with Easter in April rather than March this year, the plan is for
sales in existing stores to increase in the 1% to 3% range in the March reporting period and to increase in the 6% to 8% range in the April reporting period.
 
The Company also announced that in the second quarter ended March 1, 2003, it had purchased in the open market 278,800 shares of the Company's Common Stock at a cost of $7,950,000.  As previously reported, the Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to five million shares of Common Stock from time to time as market conditions warrant, and in the first quarter ended November 30, 2002, the Company purchased 1,503,400 shares of Common Stock at a cost of $44,709,000.
