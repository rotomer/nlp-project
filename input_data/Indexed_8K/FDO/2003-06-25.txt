For Immediate Release
        Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), a discount store chain operating 4,856 stores in 43 states, reported the highest sales and earnings for any third quarter and first three quarters in the Company's history. For the third quarter ended May 31, 2003, sales were $1,176.9 million, or 15.1% above sales of $1,022.1 million for the third quarter ended June 1, 2002. Net income was $69.6 million, or 14.0% above net income of $61.1 million for the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, and net income per diluted share increased to $.40 from $.35.
MATTHEWS, NC, June 25, 2003
        For the three quarters ended May 31, 2003, sales were $3,541.7 million, or 14.1% above sales of $3,104.4 million for the three quarters ended June 1, 2002. Net income for the three quarters ended May 31, 2003, was $199.8 million, or 14.2% above net income of $175.0 million for the three quarters ended June 1, 2002, and net income per diluted share increased to $1.15 from $1.01.
        The sales gains are attributable to increased sales in existing stores and to sales in new stores opened as part of the Company's store expansion program. Sales in existing stores increased approximately 4.6% in the third quarter ended May 31, 2003, above the third quarter last fiscal year, including increases of approximately 5.4% in sales of hardlines and 2.2% in sales of softlines. The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in existing stores, increased approximately 3.6% and the average transaction increased approximately 0.8% to $8.72.
        Sales in existing stores increased approximately 3.5% in the three quarters ended May 31, 2003, above the comparable period last fiscal year, including increases of approximately 4.0% in sales of hardlines and 1.9% in sales of softlines. The customer count increased approximately 1.3% and the average transaction increased approximately 2.0% to $8.95.
        During the first three quarters ended May 31, 2003, 285 new stores opened and 62 stores closed, compared to the opening of 336 new stores and the closing of 46 stores in the first three quarters last year. The openings in the third quarter this year included the first store in Wyoming, and Family Dollar now operates in 43 states. The Company plans to open 475 stores and close 65 stores during the current fiscal year ending August 30, 2003. The Company is realizing its objective of improving new store performance as for the first three quarters of fiscal 2003, the sales performance of new stores was equal to more than 90% of the chain average store sales.
        The operating results of the third quarter ended May 31, 2003, extend Family Dollar's record of consistent strong performance in a difficult retail sales environment. With the 14.0% increase in net income in the third quarter, the Company has now reported 29 consecutive quarters of earnings increases on a comparable quarter basis. Expenses as a percent to sales remained constant at 25.4% in both the third quarter last year and this year. Increased insurance and utility costs offset expense leverage in other categories. The gross profit margin as a percent to sales decreased slightly from 34.8% in the third quarter last year to 34.7% in the third quarter this year. Markdowns taken in the home fashions, domestics and housewares areas contributed to this decrease as the Company is introducing new assortments in these areas. Increased transportation fuel costs also impacted the gross profit margin. Inventories on a per store basis are at approximately the same level as last year. The Company also continues to have no long-term or short-term debt.
        As previously announced, the Company's plan is for sales in existing stores in the fourth quarter ending August 30, 2003, to increase in the 3% to 5% range. The Company also confirmed that its plan is for net income per diluted share of Common Stock in the fourth quarter ending August 30, 2003, to increase approximately 14% to 16%.
        With respect to next fiscal year, the Company announced that it will continue its aggressive store opening program. Preliminary plans are to add approximately 10% net new stores and 11% net square footage growth in the fiscal year beginning August 31, 2003. With large numbers of new stores planned to open in urban markets, the Company expects that its new stores sales performance will continue to improve. Assuming the sluggish retail sales environment continues, the Company's preliminary estimate is for net income per diluted share of Common Stock in fiscal 2004 to continue to increase in the 14% to 16% range.
        To serve the growing number of stores, a 907,000 square foot distribution facility in Odessa, Texas, will begin shipping goods next month. The Company has begun planning for construction of an eighth distribution center which is expected to be in operation by December 2004.
        The Company also announced that in the third quarter ended May 31, 2003, it had purchased in the open market 420,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at a cost of $13,192,000. As previously reported, the Board of Directors in October 2002 authorized the purchase of up to five million shares of Common Stock from time to time as market conditions warrant, and through the third quarter ended May 31, 2003, the Company has purchased 2,202,200 shares of Common Stock at a cost of $65,851,000.
