For Immediate Release
 
 
 
- Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), a discount store chain operating 5,034 stores in 43 states, reported that sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2003, were the highest in the Company's history.  For the fourth quarter ended August 30, 2003, sales were $1,208.5 million, or 14.2% above sales of $1,058.3 million for the fourth quarter ended August 31, 2002.  Net income was $47.7 million, or 13.8% above net income of $41.9 million for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year, and net income per diluted share increased to $.28 from $.24.
MATTHEWS, NC, October 1, 2003
 
Sales for the fifty-two weeks in the fiscal year ended August 30, 2003, were $4,750.2 million, or 14.1% above sales of $4,162.7 million for the fifty-two weeks in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2002.  Net income was $247.5 million for fiscal 2003, or 14.1% above net income of $216.9 million for fiscal 2002, and net income per diluted share increased to $1.43 from $1.25.
 
The sales gains in the fourth quarter are attributable to increased sales in existing stores and to sales from new stores opened as part of the Company's store expansion program.  Sales in existing stores increased approximately 4.6% in the fourth quarter ended August 30, 2003, above the comparable period last year, including increases of approximately 5.1% in sales of hardlines and approximately 2.8% in sales of softlines.  The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in existing stores, increased approximately 3.9%, and the average transaction increased approximately 0.5% to $8.66.
 
Sales in existing stores for comparable fifty-two week periods increased approximately 3.8%.  This included increases of approximately 4.3% in sales of
hardlines and approximately 2.1% in sales of softlines.  In fiscal 2003, the customer count increased approximately 1.9% and the average transaction increased approximately 1.6% to $8.87.
 
The increase in total sales also is attributable to sales from new stores.  During the fourth quarter ended August 30, 2003, 190 new stores opened and 2 stores closed.  During the fiscal year, the Company opened 475 stores and closed 64 stores.  At the end of the fiscal year on August 30, 2003, 5,027 stores were operating in 43 states.  New store performance continues to improve, with sales in fiscal 2003 in new stores equal to approximately 96% of the chain average store sales.
 
The operating results of the fourth quarter ended August 30, 2003, extend Family Dollar's record of consistent strong performance in a difficult retail sales environment.  With the 13.8% increase in net income in the fourth quarter, the Company has now reported 30 consecutive quarters of earnings increases on a comparable quarter basis.  The gross profit margin as a percent to sales increased from 32.3% in the fourth quarter last year to 32.9% in the fourth quarter this year.  Improved margins on apparel and other seasonal goods contributed to this increase.  Expenses as a percent to sales increased from 26.0% in the fourth quarter last year to 26.7% in the fourth quarter this year.  Above plan workers' compensation costs were the major cause of this increase.
 
Approximately 30 basis points of the increase in the fourth quarter this year in both the gross profit margin as a percent to sales and expenses as a percent to sales is attributable to a change in the treatment of certain vendor allowances in conformity with a recent accounting pronouncement.  Some allowances treated as a reduction of expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 were treated as a reduction in the cost of merchandise in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.  This change had no significant impact on net income in the fourth quarter and is not expected to significantly impact net income in subsequent quarters.
 
As previously reported the Company's plan is for sales in existing stores in the five week period ending October 4, 2003, to increase in the 3% to 5%
range.  Through September 30, sales in existing stores are at the upper-end of this range.  The Company's plan for the first quarter ending November 29, 2003, and the fiscal year ending August 28, 2004, is for sales in existing stores to increase in the 4% to 6% range.
 
Assuming existing store sales increases in the 4% to 6% range, and with additional sales being generated by the opening of new stores, the Company's plan is for net income per share of Common Stock to increase approximately 14% to 16% in fiscal 2004.  The Company's plan also assumes that both the gross profit margin and expenses as a percent to sales this fiscal year will increase slightly from last fiscal year due primarily to the change in the treatment of certain vendor allowances.
 
In commenting on fiscal 2003 and the Company's plans for fiscal 2004, Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated that: "In fiscal 2003, Family Dollar reported record operating results while continuing to reinvest in the business.  The milestone opening of the 5,000 store was but one of 475 new store openings.  Supply chain enhancements included the opening in Odessa, Texas, of our seventh Distribution Center and the continued implementation of merchandise software systems to improve inventory productivity.  Cash dividends declared per share of Common Stock increased by 15%  the 27 consecutive year of cash dividend increases.  We also repurchased 2.2 million shares of Common Stock at a cost of $65.9 million."
th
th
 
Mr. Levine concluded that: "Family Dollar's financial strength permits us to make substantial investments in our Company's future.  In fiscal 2004, with expected capital expenditures of about $275 million, we plan to open approximately 565 new stores, expand or relocate about 125 stores, close about 60 stores, begin construction of an eighth distribution center and continue to make investments in our Associates and in technology.  Initiatives in fiscal 2004 include store focused technology infrastructure investments to bring more value and convenience to our customers.  One immediate result is that customers will be able to use debit cards in most stores by November 2003.  Through sound investments with a focus on customers our Company will continue to gain market share and build upon its record of profitable growth."
