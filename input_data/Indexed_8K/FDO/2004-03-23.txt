MATTHEWS, NC, March 23, 2004
 
For the two quarters ended February 28, 2004, sales were $2,647.5 million, or 12.0% above sales of $2,364.8 million for the two quarters ended March 1, 2003.  Net income for the two quarters ended February 28, 2004, was $145.9 million, or 12.1% above net income of $130.2 million for the two quarters ended March 1, 2003, and net income per diluted share increased to $.84 from $.75.
 
The sales gains are attributable to increased sales in existing stores and to sales recorded in new stores opened in the Company's store expansion program.  Sales in existing stores in the second quarter ended February 28, 2004, increased approximately 2.2% above the second quarter last year, including an increase of approximately 3.2% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 1.2% in sales of softlines.  The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in existing stores, increased approximately 1.0% and the average transaction increased approximately 1.0% to
$9.52.  During the second quarter ended February 28, 2004, the Company opened 95 stores and closed 22 stores, compared to the opening of 88 stores and the closing of 13 stores during the second quarter last year.
 
Sales in existing stores in the two quarters ended February 28, 2004, increased approximately 2.4% above the comparable period last year, including an increase of approximately 3.1% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 0.1% in sales of softlines.  The customer count increased approximately 1.6% and the average transaction increased approximately 0.7% to $9.13.  During the two quarters ended February 28, 2004, the Company opened 196 stores and closed 48 stores, compared to the opening of 179 stores and closing of 42 stores during the first two quarters last year.
 
In commenting on the operating results, Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, noted that the 12.0% increase in net income in the second quarter ended February 28, 2004, was the 32 consecutive quarter in which net income had increased above the prior comparable quarter.  The earnings increase in the second quarter was achieved despite the fact that sales in existing stores increased only 0.7% in the December reporting period. When consumers began to focus again on basic consumable merchandise in January and February, as opposed to the focus on seasonal goods in December, sales in existing stores increased 3.0% in the January reporting period and 4.3% in the February reporting period.  While sales in existing stores improved in January and February, the 2.2% increase in such sales in the second quarter ended February 28, 2004, was below the Company's plan.  The below plan sales and continued increases in workers' compensation costs contributed to the deleveraging of expenses.  Expenses as a percent to sales increased from 24.1% in the second quarter last year to 24.6% in the second quarter this year.  The increase in expenses was offset in the second quarter by an increase in the
nd
gross profit margin as a percent to sales from 33.2% in the second quarter last year to 33.8% in the second quarter this year.  This improvement is attributable, in part, to improved initial margins on merchandise through better sourcing of goods and to lower levels of markdowns as a result of purchasing seasonal goods on a conservative basis and better allocation of those goods to the stores.  A change in the treatment of certain vendor allowances in conformity with a recent accounting pronouncement also contributed to the increase in the second quarter this year in both expenses as a percent to sales and gross profit margin as a percent to sales.  The Company's inventories at the end of the second quarter this year were in a good position, with more basic consumable merchandise in the stores resulting in per store inventories being slightly above the inventory level as at the end of the second quarter last year.  Fall apparel inventories at the end of the second quarter this year were about 20% below such inventories on a per store basis at the end of the second quarter last year.
 
The Company also announced that during the fiscal year ending August 28, 2004, it expects to open approximately 525 to 565 stores.  Originally the plan was to open approximately 565 stores.  Approximately 30 fewer stores than planned were opened during the six months ended February 28, 2004.  The Company's focus on urban markets has contributed to the strong sales performance of new stores, but the lead times for the opening of urban stores continue to be less predictable.  While urban markets continue to be a focus, the Company plans to allocate some additional resources to small and mid-sized towns, where new stores can often be opened more quickly and predictably.  Operating results in small and mid-sized towns have been improving as the Company has raised store standards and improved merchandise quality.
 
For the second half of the fiscal year ending August 28, 2004, the Company confirmed its previous guidance that its plan is for net income per diluted
share of Common Stock to increase approximately 14% to 16%.  This guidance is based on the assumption that sales in existing stores in the second half of the fiscal year will increase in the 3% to 5% range.
 
The Company also announced that in the second quarter ended February 28, 2004, it had purchased in the open market 956,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at a cost of $33.5 million.  No shares were purchased in the first quarter ended November 29, 2003.  As previously reported, in October 2002 the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to five million shares of Common Stock from time to time as market conditions warrant, and in the fiscal year ended August 30, 2003, the Company purchased 2.2 million shares of Common Stock at a cost of $65.9 million.
