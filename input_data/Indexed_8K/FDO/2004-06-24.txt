Net income was $73.8 million, or 6.0% above net income of $69.6 million for the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, and net income per diluted share increased to $.43 from $.40.
MATTHEWS, NC, June 24, 2004
 
For the three quarters ended May 29, 2004, sales were $3,957.6 million, or 11.7% above sales of $3,541.7 million for the three quarters ended May 31, 2003. Net income for the three quarters ended May 29, 2004, was $219.7 million, or 10.0% above net income of $199.8 million for the three quarters ended May 31, 2003, and net income per diluted share increased to $1.27 from $1.15.
 
The sales gains are attributable to increased sales in existing stores and to sales in new stores opened as part of the Company's store expansion program.  Sales in existing stores increased approximately 1.9% in the third quarter ended May 29, 2004, above the third quarter last fiscal year, including an increase of approximately 3.4% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 3.4% in sales of softlines.  The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in existing stores, was at the same level in both quarters and the average transaction increased approximately 1.7% to $8.87.
 
Sales in existing stores increased approximately 2.2% in the three quarters ended May 29, 2004, above the comparable period last fiscal year,
including an increase of approximately 3.2% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 1.2% in sales of softlines.  The customer count
increased approximately 1.1% and the average transaction increased approximately 1.0% to $9.04.
 
During the first three quarters ended May 29, 2004, 297 stores opened and 55 stores closed, compared to the opening of 285 stores and the closing of 62 stores in the first three quarters last year.  The Company's current plan is to open about 500 stores and close 64 stores during the current fiscal year ending August 28, 2004.
 
The 6% increase in net income in the third quarter ended May 29, 2004, was achieved in a difficult economic environment, marked by rising energy prices, for the Company's low to low-middle income customer base.  Sales of basic consumable merchandise, such as household chemicals, paper products and food, continued to be satisfactory.  However, sales of more discretionary merchandise, including hanging apparel, domestics, giftwear and seasonal goods were below the Company's plan.  The below plan sales and continued increases in insurance costs, including workers' compensation, contributed to the deleveraging of expenses.  Expenses as a percent to sales increased from 25.4% in the third quarter last year to 26.0% in the third quarter this year.  The increase in expenses was partially offset in the third quarter by an increase in the gross profit margin as a percent to sales from 34.7% in the third quarter last year to 34.9% in the third quarter this year.  This improvement is attributable to a change in the treatment of certain vendor allowances in conformity with a recent accounting pronouncement which also contributed to the increase in the third quarter this year in expenses as a percent to sales.  The gross profit margin as a percent to sales in the third quarter was positively impacted by lower levels of markdowns as a result of purchasing seasonal goods on a conservative basis and better allocation of those goods to the stores, and adversely impacted by increased shrinkage and freight costs.
 
The Company's inventories at the end of the third quarter this year were approximately 8.5% higher on a per store basis than at the end of the third quarter last year.  In a difficult sales environment, the Company became more aggressive in assuring that the stores were amply stocked with the basic
consumable goods customers need day-in and day-out.  The additional inventories in the stores are primarily these consumable goods, as apparel inventories were only approximately 1.5% higher on a per store basis.  The Company expects consumables inventories to be at more normal levels at the end of the fourth quarter.
 
As previously announced, the Company's plan is for sales in existing stores in the fourth quarter ending August 28, 2004, to increase in the 2% to 4% range.  The Company also confirmed that its plan is for net income per diluted share of Common Stock in the fourth quarter ending August 28, 2004, to increase approximately 8% to 12%.
 
The Company also announced that it will continue its aggressive store opening program in fiscal 2005.  Preliminary plans are to open about 500 to 560 stores and close 60 to 70 stores resulting in about 8% to 9% net new store growth and 9% to 10% net square footage growth in the fiscal year beginning August 29, 2004.  To achieve this target, the Company is retaining real estate brokers in certain major metropolitan areas and also is adding personnel to its Real Estate Department.  Urban markets will continue to be the focus, but additional resources also are being allocated to small and mid-sized towns, where new stores can often be opened more quickly and predictably.
 
To support the focus on urban markets, new and expanded initiatives are being planned and implemented to enhance operating performance.  The Company believes that investments in process changes, technology, training and people offer significant opportunities to improve consumers' shopping experience in these underserved markets.  Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, concluded that:  "While we are achieving good results in urban markets, these markets offer the greatest opportunities for improvement in our store operations.  Based on what we have learned from operating stores in urban areas for many years, during the next twelve months initiatives will be implemented in about thirty of our largest metropolitan markets covering more than 1,000 stores.  These initiatives will result in better execution of our merchandising concept in urban markets and lead to increased sales and earnings for our Company."
The Company also announced that in the third quarter ended May 29, 2004, it had purchased in the open market 3,075,800 shares of the Company's Common Stock at a cost of $95,828,000.  An additional 460,000 shares of Common Stock have been purchased in the open market in June 2004 at a cost of $15,367,000.  Under the current authorization from the Board of Directors, the Company may purchase up to an additional 3.3 million shares of Common Stock.
