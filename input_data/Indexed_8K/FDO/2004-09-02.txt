For Immediate Release
 
 
- Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), a discount store chain operating 5,468 stores in 44 states, reported sales for the four week period ended August 28, 2004, of approximately $406.1 million, or 8.6% above sales of $374.0 million for the similar period in the prior fiscal year.  Sales in existing stores for the four week period ended August 28, 2004, decreased approximately 0.1% below existing store sales for the similar period in the prior fiscal year, including an increase of approximately 2.5% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 8.9% in sales of softlines.
MATTHEWS, NC, September 2, 2004
 
For the thirteen week period ended August 28, 2004, sales were approximately $1,324.2 million, or 9.6% above sales of $1,208.5 million for the similar period in the prior fiscal year.  Sales in existing stores for the thirteen week period ended August 28, 2004, increased approximately 0.7% above existing store sales for the similar period in the prior fiscal year, including an increase of approximately 2.9% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 7.2% in sales of softlines. 
Sales of basic consumable merchandise continued to be satisfactory.  However, sales of more discretionary merchandise, such as hanging apparel and domestics, were below the Company's plan.  As a result, the gross profit margin for the thirteen week period ended August 28, 2004, will be adversely impacted by additional markdowns and lower sales of higher margin merchandise.  The Company currently expects that net income per diluted share of Common Stock will be in the range of $.25 to $.26 in the thirteen week period ended August 28, 2004, compared to $.28 in the similar period in the prior fiscal year.
 
For the fifty-two week period ended August 28, 2004, sales were approximately $5,281.9 million, or 11.2% above sales of $4,750.2 million for the

similar period in the prior fiscal year.  Sales in existing stores for comparable fifty-two week periods increased approximately 1.9%, including an increase of approximately 3.2% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 2.5% in sales of softlines.
 
The Company's plan is for sales in existing stores in the five week period ending October 2, 2004, to be in a range from approximately the same level to up 2% from the similar period in the prior fiscal year.
 
The Company also reported the opening of 203 stores and the closing of 6 stores in the thirteen week period ended August 28, 2004.  For the fiscal year ended August 28, 2004, Family Dollar opened 500 stores and closed 61 stores.
