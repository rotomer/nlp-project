MATTHEWS, NC, November 4, 2004
- Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), a discount store chain operating 5,502 stores in 44 states, reported sales for the four-week period ended October 30, 2004, of approximately $411.7 million, or 8.8% above sales of $378.4 million for the similar period in the prior fiscal year.  Sales in existing stores for the four-week period ended October 30, 2004, increased approximately 0.9% above existing store sales for the similar period in the prior fiscal year, including an increase of approximately 2.1% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 3.1% in sales of softlines.
     For the nine-week period ended October 30, 2004, sales were approximately $922.3 million, or 9.5% above sales of $842.1 million for the similar period in the prior fiscal year.  Sales in existing stores for the nine-week period ended October 30, 2004, increased approximately 1.2% above existing store sales for the similar period in the prior fiscal year, including an increase of approximately 3.4% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 6.2% in sales of softlines.
     During the nine-week period ended October 30, 2004, sales of more discretionary merchandise, such as hanging apparel and domestics, were below the Company's plan.  The continuing shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin consumables and less higher margin discretionary goods and the continuing impact of shrinkage will adversely impact the gross profit margin in the first quarter ending November 27, 2004.  In the first quarter, the Company also is incurring expenses as planned in connection with the urban initiative and other previously discussed initiatives which are expected to positively impact sales later in the fiscal year.
 
                                                                          Continued . . .

     As of October 30, 2004, there were 5,496 stores in operation, including 19 stores that were opened during the four-week period ended October 30, 2004.
     The Company's current plan is for sales in existing stores in the four-week period ending November 27, 2004, to increase in the 3% to 5% range.  Sales in this period are expected to be aided by the distribution of an advertising circular in the first week of November.
