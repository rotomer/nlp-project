For Immediate Release
 
AND SALES AND GUIDANCE FOR EARNINGS
- Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), a discount store chain operating 5,558 stores in 44 states, reported sales for the four-week period ended November 27, 2004, of approximately $457.9 million, or 13.7% above sales of $402.6 million for the similar period in the prior fiscal year.  Sales in existing stores for the four-week period ended November 27, 2004, increased approximately 5.2% above existing store sales for the similar period in the prior fiscal year, including an increase of approximately 7.1% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 1.2% in sales of softlines.  While it is difficult to quantify the impact of the circular, of the approximate 5.2% increase in sales in existing stores, the Company attributes approximately 2% to 3% to the distribution of an advertising circular in the first week of November.
MATTHEWS, NC, December 2, 2004
 
For the thirteen-week period ended November 27, 2004, sales were approximately $1,380.2 million, or 10.9% above sales of $1,244.7 million for the similar period in the prior fiscal year.  Sales in existing stores for the thirteen-week period ended November 27, 2004, increased approximately 2.5% above existing store sales for the similar period in the prior fiscal year, including an increase of approximately 4.5% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 4.6% in sales of softlines.
 
During the thirteen-week period ended November 27, 2004, sales of more discretionary merchandise, such as hanging apparel and home decor, were below the Company's plan.  The continuing shift in the merchandise mix to more lower margin consumables and less higher margin discretionary goods and the continuing impact of shrinkage will adversely impact the gross profit margin in the period.  The substantial additional sales of sharply priced merchandise in the advertising circular in the first week of November also will adversely impact the gross profit margin.  The Company also is incurring expenses as planned in connection with the urban initiative and other previously discussed initiatives which are expected to positively impact
 
 
sales later in the fiscal year.  The Company currently expects that net income per diluted share of Common Stock will be in the range of $.32 to $.33 in the thirteen-week period ended November 27, 2004, compared to $.37 in the similar period in the prior fiscal year.
 
As of November 27, 2004, there were 5,555 stores in operation, including 98 stores that were opened during the thirteen-week period ended on that date.
 
The Company's plan is for sales in existing stores in the five-week period ending January 1, 2005, to increase in the 2% to 3% range.
