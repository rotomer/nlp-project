MATTHEWS, NC, March 3, 2005
- Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), a discount store chain operating 5,601 stores in 44 states, reported sales for the four week period ended February 26, 2005, of approximately $458.1 million, or 13.3% above sales of $404.3 million for the similar period in the prior fiscal year.  Sales in existing stores for the four week period ended February 26, 2005, increased approximately 4.9% above existing store sales for the similar period in the prior fiscal year, including increases of approximately 5.3% in sales of hardlines and approximately 3.8% in sales of softlines.
For the thirteen week period ended February 26, 2005, sales were approximately $1.587 billion, or 13.1% above sales of $1.403 billion for the similar period in the prior fiscal year.  Sales in existing stores for the thirteen week period ended February 26, 2005, increased approximately 4.5% above existing store sales for the similar period in the prior fiscal year, including an increase
of approximately 5.8% in sales of hardlines and no change in sales of softlines.
While the Company is pleased with the recent sales improvement, sales of lower margin consumables continue to outpace sales growth.  As in the last two quarters, this ongoing shift of the merchandise mix and the continuing adverse impact of shrinkage will negatively impact the gross profit margin in the second quarter ended February 26, 2005.  In the second quarter, the Company also incurred expenses as planned in connection with the urban initiative and the start of the installation in stores of coolers for the sale of perishable goods.

For the twenty-six week period ended February 26, 2005, sales were approximately $2.967 billion, or 12.0% above sales of $2.648 billion for  the similar period in the prior fiscal year.  Sales in existing stores for the twenty-six week period ended February 26, 2005, increased approximately 3.6% above existing store sales for the similar period in the prior fiscal year, including an increase of approximately 5.2% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 2.0% in sales of softlines.
In response to clarifying guidance recently provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company is reviewing and expects to correct its lease accounting practices related to store locations.  The Company expects to complete the review by the March 22, 2005, date of the release of its financial results for the second quarter ended February 26, 2005.  This change in accounting practice will not impact historical or future cash flows.
As of February 26, 2005, the Company had 5,600 stores in operation, including 90 stores that were opened during the thirteen week period ended on that date.
The Company's plan is for sales in existing stores in the five week period ending April 2, 2005, to increase in the 3% to 5% range.  Sales are expected to be aided by the distribution of an advertising circular in the last week of
the period.
