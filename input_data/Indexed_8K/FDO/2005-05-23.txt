Fortunately, I will be able to continue to rely on his insights in his role as a member of our Board of Directors."

Today, Family Dollar operates more than 5,600 stores in 44 states.  I will be forever grateful to the Company's founder, Leon Levine, for the opportunity to learn from such a talented entrepreneur and for providing strong leadership through his son, Howard.  I have enjoyed working with this highly talented management team and all Associates, and I look forward to continuing to serve as a member of the Board of Directors."
 
Janet G. Kelley, Senior Vice President and Senior Counsel, will succeed Mr. Mahoney as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.  Kiley F. Rawlins, Divisional Vice President  Communications, will assume Investor Relations, Financial Communications and Media Relations responsibilities.
