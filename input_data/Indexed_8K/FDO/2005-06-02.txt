FAMILY DOLLAR REPORTS SALES AND PROVIDES EARNINGS GUIDANCE
FOR THE THIRD QUARTER
 
- - Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that sales for the four weeks ended May 28, 2005, increased 7.5% to approximately $442.5 million from $411.5 million for the four weeks ended May 29, 2004.  For the four week period ended May 28, 2005, compared with the four week period ended May 29, 2004, comparable store sales increased approximately 0.2%.  As of May 28, 2005, there were 5,681 stores in operation, including 34 stores that were opened in fiscal May 2005.
MATTHEWS, NC, June 2, 2005
 
For the four week period ended May 28, 2005, compared with the four week period ended May 29, 2004, hardline sales in comparable stores increased approximately 1.5% and softline sales in comparable stores decreased approximately 4.3%.  Sales of apparel and other seasonal merchandise continued to be below the Company's plan.  Unseasonably cool weather and the difficult economy, including higher energy prices, for the Company's low and low-middle income customer base have impacted spending on apparel and other more discretionary merchandise.
 
For the thirteen weeks ended May 28, 2005, sales increased 9.0% to approximately $1.428 billion, from $1.310 billion in the thirteen weeks ended May 29, 2004.  For the thirteen week period ended May 28, 2005, compared with the thirteen week period ended May 29, 2004, comparable store sales increased approximately 1.3% above comparable store sales last year, including an increase of approximately 2.4% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 2.6% in sales of softlines.  Comparable store sales increases in the June reporting period are planned to increase in the 2% to 3% range.
 
Previously, the Company's plan had been for net income per diluted share of Common Stock in the third quarter to be between $.33 and $.37, compared to $.42 in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year.  This plan reflected an expectation that comparable store sales in the third quarter would increase approximately 2%.  As actual comparable store sales for the third quarter were below this expectation, the Company believes that earnings per share for the third quarter will also be slightly below the range of previous guidance.
 
The Company also advised that it has accelerated its program for the installation of coolers for the sale of perishable food.  The Company currently anticipates that it will have coolers installed in approximately 1,000 stores by the end of the fiscal year.
