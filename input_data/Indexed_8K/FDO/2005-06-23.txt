For Immediate Release
 
 
MATTHEWS, NC, June 23, 2005 - Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), reported that net income per diluted share decreased 23.8% to $0.32 from $0.42, and that net income was $53.8 million, or 25.7% below net income of $72.4 million for the third quarter of the prior fiscal year.  The Company's current plan is for net income per diluted share of Common Stock for the fourth quarter ended August 27, 2005, to be between $0.21 and $0.24, compared to $0.25 in the prior fiscal year.
 
"As we indicated in our comments at the beginning of this fiscal year, we expected the third quarter to be our most challenging quarter of the year as a result of anticipated gross profit margin pressure and planned investments in our key initiatives.  Unfortunately, the challenging sales environment this Spring, resulting from unseasonably cool weather and a difficult economy for the Company's low and low-middle income customer, aggravated the operating profit margin pressures in the quarter," said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "However, we continue to be pleased with the early results of our major initiatives.
 
"At the end of the third quarter, we had initiated investments in process changes, technology and people in approximately 800 stores in major urban markets, and we expect to expand this initiative to approximately 1,300 stores by September.  While these stores are also affected by macro-economic factors, they have had consistently higher comparable store sales than the rest of the chain, and we are encouraged by the early operating results of these stores.
 
"We are also excited about the preliminary results from the installation of refrigerated coolers in selected stores.  The customer response has been strong, and we have decided to accelerate the implementation from 500 stores to 1,000 stores by the end of the fiscal year.  At the end of the third quarter, coolers had been installed and fully stocked with perishable food in approximately 650 stores."
 
Mr. Levine concluded, "The third quarter was difficult for our customers and our Company.  However, we remain confident that these initiatives will position Family Dollar for long-term profitable growth."
 
Sales for the third quarter ended May 28, 2005, were approximately $1.428billion, or 9.0% above sales of approximately $1.310 billion for the third quarter ended May 29, 2004.  Sales in comparable stores in the third quarter of 2005 increased approximately 1.3% above the third quarter 2004, including an increase of approximately 2.4% in sales of hardlines and a decrease of approximately 2.6% in sales of softlines.  The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, decreased approximately 1.5% and the average transaction increased approximately 2.6% to $9.10.  The Company expects comparable store sales in the fourth quarter to increase 2 to 4%.
During the third quarter of 2005, the Company opened 90 stores and closed 9 stores.  In the first three quarters of 2005, the Company opened 278 new stores and closed 63 stores.  For the full year, the Company expects to open approximately 500 new stores and close 65 to70 stores.
 
The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 34.9% in the third quarter last year to 33.6% in the third quarter this year.  This decline was a result of the impact of higher markdowns, higher inventory shrinkage and higher freight costs, all as a percentage of sales.  In addition, sales of lower-margin basic consumables continued to be stronger than sales of higher-margin discretionary goods, reflecting unseasonably cool weather and the difficult economy, including higher energy prices, for the Company's low and low-middle income customer base.
 
Expenses, as percentage of sales, increased from 26.2% in the third quarter last year to 27.6% in the third quarter this year.  Lower than expected sales in the third quarter and the planned expenses incurred in connection with the urban initiative and the installation in stores of coolers for the sale of perishable goods contributed to the increase in expenses, as a percentage of sales.
 
The Company's effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 36.7% compared to 36.5% in the third quarter last year.
 
The Company's inventories at the end of the third quarter this year were $990.8 million, or 8.6% above inventories of $912.5 million last year.  Inventory on a per store basis at the end of the third quarter was 1.5% lower than last year, excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers.  The majority of this decrease was in softline merchandise.
 
For the first three quarters of 2005, capital expenditures were $147.7 million compared with $131.4 last year.  The Company also announced that in the first three quarters of 2005, the Company had purchased 2.9 million shares of the Company's Common Stock in the open market at a cost of $80.6 million.
