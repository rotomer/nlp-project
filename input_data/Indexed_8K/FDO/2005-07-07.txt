FAMILY DOLLAR REPORTS JUNE SALES
 
- Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that sales for the five weeks ended July 2, 2005, increased 8.6% to approximately $566.9 million from $521.9 million for the five weeks ended July 3, 2004.  For the five week period ended July 2, 2005, compared with the five week period ended July 3, 2004, comparable store sales increased approximately 1.4%.  As of July 2, 2005, there were 5,732 stores in operation, including 54 stores that were opened in fiscal June 2005.
MATTHEWS, NC, July 7, 2005
 
For the five week period ended July 2, 2005, compared with the five week period ended July 3, 2004, hardline merchandise sales in comparable stores increased approximately 2.2% and softline merchandise sales in comparable stores decreased approximately 1.3%.  Sales of seasonal merchandise and hanging apparel responded well to the warming trend experienced in several markets.  However, overall customer response to recent schematic changes in some core consumable categories has not been as strong as expected.  The Company has evaluated sales in these categories and is making assortment changes where appropriate. Sales from the refrigerated cooler installation continue to be encouraging, and stores in the Urban Initiative program continue to produce higher sales increases than the rest of the chain.
 
For the forty-four week period ended July 2, 2005, sales increased 10.8% to approximately $4.962 billion from $4.480 billion for the forty-four week period ended July 3, 2004.  Sales in existing stores for the comparable forty-four week periods increased approximately 2.6%, including an increase of approximately 3.9% in sales of hardline merchandise and a decrease of approximately 2.2% in sales of softline merchandise.
 
The Company plans for sales in existing stores in the July reporting period to increase in the 2% to 3% range.
