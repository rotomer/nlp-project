1.
                                      
Stock Option Acceleration Program.
 
On August 18, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the acceleration of the vesting date of certain previously issued and outstanding options under the 1989 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), effective as of August 26, 2005.  The accelerated vesting program applies to: (i) all unvested options that currently have an exercise price in excess of $40.00/share (the "$40 options"), including options held by named executive officers of the Company, as described below; and (ii) all unvested options that are "underwater" (i.e. the options have an exercise price in excess of the market value of the stock, determined as of August 26, 2005) and are held by employees at the level of manager or below (the "employee options"). The exact number and identification of the employee options subject to the accelerated vesting program will be determined by the management of the Company in connection with the development of certain changes in the Company's compensation programs prior to the Company's 2005 fiscal year-end.
 
Because most of these options are significantly underwater, the Company believes that these options no longer provide a retention incentive for employees at the level of manager or below and that the acceleration program will have a positive effect on employee morale.  For employees over the level of manager, the Company believes that, with the exception of the $40 options, outstanding options continue to provide an appropriate retention incentive. The Company also implemented the acceleration program for the purpose of reducing the compensation expense the Company would otherwise be required to recognize as a result of the Company's adoption, effective for its fiscal year commencing August 28, 2005 (the "2006 fiscal year"), of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("FAS 123R"), which, under the modified prospective transition method, requires the expensing of unvested stock options in the first fiscal year of a company beginning after June 15, 2005.  Currently, the Company accounts for options using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and provides footnote disclosure of the compensation expense associated with stock options.  The future expense that will be eliminated as a result of the option acceleration program is currently estimated to be approximately $12.8 million, or $8.1 million net of taxes (of which approximately $2.5 million, or $1.6 million net of taxes, is attributable to $40 options held by named executive officers) over a period of four years during which the options would have vested, subject to determination of the exact number of options subject to the acceleration program and the impact of additional adjustments related to cancellation of certain options.  The elimination of this future expense will be substantially offset by additional compensation expense the Company expects to incur in connection with new compensation programs being developed for implementation during the 2006 fiscal year, which are designed to improve the linkage between pay and performance.
 
The following $40 options are held by the current named executive officers of the Company: Howard R. Levine - 200,000 shares and R. James Kelly  110,000 shares.  In addition, 95,000 $40 options are held by George R. Mahoney, who was a named executive officer of the Company prior to his retirement in May 2005.  The $40 options held by the named executive officers were granted on September 29, 2003, and have an exercise price of $40.75. Absent this acceleration program these $40 options would have vested as follows:  40% in September 2005 and 30% in each of September 2006 and 2007.  These $40 options will expire on September 28, 2008. As a condition to such acceleration, Messrs. Levine and Kelly may not sell shares acquired upon the exercise of the $40 options (other than shares to cover the exercise price and satisfy withholding taxes) until the occurrence of the date on which such
options would have vested under the original vesting schedule, or, if earlier, the termination of such executive's employment with the Company.

Modification of Lead Director Compensation.
 
On August 18, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), upon the recommendation of the Board's Compensation Committee, approved a change in the compensation of the Company's Lead Director.  Effective as of July 1, 2005, the Lead Director will receive an annual cash retainer in the amount of $12,000 (payable quarterly in arrears), in addition to all other non-employee director compensation, which remains unchanged from the amounts set forth in the Company's Form 8-K report filed January 21, 2005.
 
There is no written agreement with respect to compensation payable to the Lead Director.  A copy of the resolution approving the terms of the compensation described above is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
3.
                                      
Employment Agreements with Howard R. Levine and R. James Kelly.
 
On August 18, 2005, with the unanimous approval of the independent directors of the Board, upon the recommendation of the Board's Compensation Committee, the Company entered into new employment agreements with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Howard R. Levine, (the "Levine Agreement"), and Vice-Chairman and Chief Administrative and Financial Officer, R. James Kelly (the "Kelly Agreement," and together with the Levine Agreement, the "Employment Agreements").   Following a report from HayGroup, Inc., the Compensation Committee of the Board reviewed the terms and conditions of the Employment Agreements and recommended to the Board that they be approved.  The Employment Agreements (which are substantially identical) replace the prior employment agreements between the Company and each of Messrs. Levine and Kelly.
 
The Employment Agreements provide for a one year rolling term, which automatically extends each month for an additional month; provided, however, that either party may terminate the extensions by providing written notice to the other party.  The Employment Agreements also provide that Messrs. Levine and Kelly will be paid a weekly base salary, as established by the Board.  The base salary will be reviewed each year by the Board when it conducts its annual review of executive compensation.  Messrs. Levine and Kelly will also be eligible to participate in the Company's Incentive Profit Sharing Plan (as may be amended or modified from time-to-time).  Subject to certain terms and conditions contained therein, the Employment Agreements state that the Company will pay severance of one year's base salary to Messrs. Levine and Kelly if the Company terminates either Agreement prior to its expiration; provided that such termination is not for Cause or a result of Medical Disability (as defined in the Employment Agreements). The Employment Agreements also provide for payments of pro rata bonus amounts under the Company's Incentive Profit Sharing Plan upon a termination of the employee that is not for Cause.  The Employment Agreements prohibit Messrs. Levine and Kelly from engaging in activities that compete with the Company and from soliciting employees of the Company for one year after the termination of their respective agreements, regardless of the reason for termination.
 
The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Employment Agreements, and reference is made to the complete text of each Agreement which in the case of the Levine Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, and in the case of the Kelly Agreement, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3.
Item 1.02   Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
The entry into the Employment Agreements by Messrs. Levine and Kelly, as described in Item 1.01, terminates the prior employment agreements (and all amendments thereto) entered into between the Company and Mr. Levine, and the Company and Mr. Kelly, respectively.
 
The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this current report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 1.02.
 
Item 7.01   Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On August 19, 2005, the Company issued a news release announcing that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the Company's stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Company's common stock in addition to previously announced authorizations.  The funds for such repurchase program will be derived from the Company's cash from operations and borrowings.
 
A copy of the news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(a) Participate in the Company's Target Bonus Plan, as it may be amended or modified in any respect, including achievement of established goals, as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.

Nothing contained herein shall limit the Company's right to alter, amend or terminate the Target Bonus Plan at any time for any reason.  The Employee further acknowledges that, except as provided in Section 6.03, pursuant to the terms of the Target Bonus Plan, in the event the Employee is not employed by the Company, for whatever reason, at the time the bonus for the fiscal year is actually paid to participants in the Target Bonus Plan following the end of the fiscal year, the Employee will not be entitled to receive the bonus.

Termination
                            
 
6.01.
 
Death.  In the event of Employee's death, Employee's employment shall be deemed to have terminated effective as of the date of Employee's death.  Upon the death of the Employee, the Company shall pay to his widow if he is married or his estate if he is not married or his wife predeceases him only such amount as was due and payable to the Employee at the time of his death.
(a)
                                 
 
Disability.  The Company may also terminate this Agreement should the Employee experience a Medical Disability, which termination shall be effective upon the Company's giving written notice to the Employee following the expiration of the Medical Disability period.
(b)
                                
 
By Company for Cause.  The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time, without notice, for Cause.
(c)
                                 
 
For Other Reasons.  It is agreed that the Company, or Employee, may terminate this Agreement for any reason at any time upon written notice to the other party.  Except as provided in Paragraph 4, this Agreement shall no longer be
(d)
                                
of any force and effect as of the date of such notice or such other date as may be agreed by the Company and the Employee (herein called the "Termination Date").  If either party terminates this Agreement, the Company may relieve the Employee of all duties and responsibilities effective on the date of notice.
 
Upon termination of this Agreement by the Company, except for the provisions of Paragraph 4, the Employee's employment under the terms of this Agreement and all other agreements and contracts between the Employee, the Company and the Company's Affiliate and subsidiary corporations, shall be terminated effective on the Termination Date.  Should the Company terminate this Agreement prior to the end of the term of this Agreement, for reasons other than for Cause or Medical Disability, it shall pay to the Employee, one year of the base salary set forth in Paragraph 5.01 above in effect on the date of the notice (which shall constitute payment in full of the compensation due to the Employee hereunder).  Any such payments shall be made in twelve (12) equal monthly installments with the first such installment due and payable not later than thirty (30) days after the Termination Date.  Such payments made by the Company to the Employee are herein called "Termination Compensation."  In the event the Employee accepts or begins other employment as an employee, consultant or in any other capacity prior to the date on which the twelfth monthly installment of Termination Compensation is due and payable, the monthly payments of any unpaid balance of the Termination Compensation as of the date of such new employment shall be (i) eliminated if the monthly base salary and all other monthly remuneration and compensation from the new employment exceeds the monthly base salary of the Employee in effect on the date of the notice, or (ii) reduced to the amount by which the monthly base salary of the Employee in effect on the date of the notice exceeds the monthly base salary and all other monthly remuneration and compensation from the new employment.  The Employee agrees to pursue reasonable, good faith efforts to obtain other employment in a position suitable to his background and experience.  Moreover, the Employee agrees to notify the Company within three business days of obtaining other employment during the time period in which he is receiving Termination Compensation.
6.02.
                       
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Company terminates this Agreement for reasons other than for Cause, or if the
6.03.
                       
Agreement is terminated as a result of the Employee's Death or Medical Disability, the Employee shall be entitled to receive as additional Termination Compensation an amount equal to the pro rata share of the bonus, or the full bonus, as the case may be, if any, under and subject to the terms and conditions of the Target Bonus Plan referred to in Section 5.02(a).  This payment is equal to the amount, if any, the Employee would have received following the end of the fiscal year if the Target Bonus Plan did not have a requirement that the Employee be employed by the Company at the time the bonus is customarily paid.  Such payment shall be made to the Employee at the same time the Company makes payments to other participants in the Target Bonus Plan.
 
On the Termination Date or at the end of the term of this Agreement, the Employee agrees that he will resign as an officer and director of the Company, its Affiliate and subsidiary corporations (if and when elected), and from any other positions, which resignations shall become effective on the Termination Date.
6.04.
                       
 
After the Termination Date or the end of the term of this Agreement, the Employee covenants to render further advice and assistance to the Company as may be required from time to time, and to provide all information available to him on matters handled by and through him while employed by the Company or of which he has personal knowledge, and by making available to the Company at reasonable times and circumstances, upon request by the Company, information pertinent to its operations in his possession; and, to the extent that it is necessary, to cooperate with and assist the Company to conclude any matters that are pending and which may require his assistance; provided, that he shall be paid reasonable compensation by the Company in the event he is required to expend time in the performance of such services; and provided further, that the Employee may perform such services in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with other employment obtained by the Employee.  The Employee shall be reimbursed for any expenses incurred by him in the performance of the covenants herein set forth in this Section 6.05.
6.05.
                       
 
In addition, the Employee agrees to cooperate with and provide assistance to the Company and its legal counsel in connection with any litigation (including arbitration or administrative hearings) or investigation affecting the Company, in which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company's counsel, the Employee's
assistance or cooperation is needed.  The Employee shall, when requested by the Company, provide testimony or other assistance and shall travel at the Company's request in order to fulfill this obligation.  In connection with such litigation or investigation, the Company shall attempt to accommodate the Employee's schedule, shall reimburse the Employee (unless prohibited by law) for any actual loss wages in connection therewith, shall provide the Employee with reasonable notice in advance of the times in which the Employee's cooperation or assistance is needed, and shall reimburse the Employee for any reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such matters.
 
After the Termination Date or the end of the term of this Agreement, the Employee agrees not to make any statements to the Company's employees, customers or suppliers or to any public or media source, whether written or oral, regarding the Employee's employment or termination from the Company's employment, except as may be approved in writing by an executive officer of the Company in advance.  The Employee further agrees not to make any statement (including to any media source, or to the Company's suppliers, customers or employees) or take any action that would disrupt, impair, embarrass, harm or affect adversely the Group or any of their employees, officers, directors, or customers, or place the Group or such individuals in any negative light.
6.06.
                       
 
.     This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of any successor to or assignee of the Company, and the Employee specifically agrees on demand to execute any and all necessary documents in connection with the performance of this Agreement.  No waiver by either party of any breach by the other of any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any such or other provision of this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid or unenforceable as a matter of law, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement or of the remainder of this Agreement as a whole.
7.
                                      
Special Provisions
 
This Agreement sets forth all of the terms of the understanding between the parties with reference to the subject matter set forth herein and may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties,
but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
 
.     Because the Employee's services are unique and because the Employee has access to Confidential Information, the parties agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any breach by the Employee of any of the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Agreement.  In the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Agreement, the Company or its successors or assigns may, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive relief or other equitable relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of any such provision (without posting a bond or other security).  In addition to the foregoing and not in any way in limitation thereof, or in limitation of any right or remedy otherwise available to the Company, if the Employee violates any provision of paragraph 4 of this Agreement, any compensation, benefits and/or Termination Compensation then or thereafter due from the Company to the Employee shall be terminated forthwith and the Company's obligation to pay or provide and the Employee's right to receive such compensation, benefits and/or Termination Compensation shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, in each case without limiting or affecting the Employee's obligations under such paragraphs 4 or the Company's other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.
8.
                                      
Enforcement
 
.  The Employee agrees that any claim against the Company or any of its Affiliates or their employees arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or to the Employee's employment with the Company, shall be brought exclusively in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina or the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, and in no other forum.  Employee hereby irrevocably consents to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of these courts for the purpose of adjudicating any claims subject to this forum selection clause.  Employee also agrees that any dispute of any kind arising out of or relating to this Agreement or to the Employee's employment shall at the Company's sole election or demand be submitted to final, conclusive and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator and according to the rules then prevailing of the

The base salary shall be reviewed annually by the Board in connection with its annual review of executive compensation, unless Employee's employment shall have been terminated earlier pursuant to this Agreement, to determine if such base salary should be increased for the following year in recognition of services to the Company and shall initially be set at a rate not less than the Employee's current annual salary. The salary shall be payable at such intervals in conformity with the Company's prevailing practice as such practice shall be established or modified from time to time.
5.01.

(a) Participate in the Company's Target Bonus Plan, as it may be amended or modified in any respect, including achievement of established goals, as Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative and Financial Officer.  The Target Bonus Plan generally will give the Employee the opportunity to earn a bonus equal to a percentage of the Employee's base salary actually received in a given year, the precise percentage to be set by the Board of Directors of the Company, subject to the Company's achievement of certain financial goals to be established, the Employee's performance, and all terms and
conditions of the Target Bonus Plan as in effect for any such fiscal year; provided that the amount of bonus paid may not be increased by the annual individual performance rating of the Employee.  The Employee acknowledges that he has received a copy of the form of the Target Bonus Plan and related guidelines for the operation of such Plan and is familiar with the terms and conditions thereof.  Nothing contained herein shall limit the Company's right to alter, amend or terminate the Target Bonus Plan at any time for any reason.  The Employee further acknowledges that, except as provided in Section 6.03, pursuant to the terms of the Target Bonus Plan, in the event the Employee is not employed by the Company, for whatever reason, at the time the bonus for the fiscal year is actually paid to participants in the Target Bonus Plan following the end of the fiscal year, the Employee will not be entitled to receive the bonus.
 
(b)  Additional benefits and/or compensation in such form and in such manner and at such times as the Board of Directors of the Company, in the exercise of its absolute discretion, shall determine, and/or as otherwise provided by the Company, consistent with benefits and/or compensation currently provided to Company employees in similar positions.
 
.  Employee's employment under this Agreement may be terminated as follows:
6.
                                      
Termination
 
6.01.
 
Death.  In the event of Employee's death, Employee's employment shall be deemed to have terminated effective as of the date of Employee's death.  Upon the death of the Employee, the Company shall pay to his widow if he is married or his estate if he is not married or his wife predeceases him only such amount as was due and payable to the Employee at the time of his death.
(a)
                                 
 
Disability.  The Company may also terminate this Agreement should the Employee experience a Medical Disability, which termination shall be effective upon the Company's giving written notice to the Employee following the expiration of the Medical Disability period.
(b)
                                
 
By Company for Cause.  The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time, without notice, for Cause.
(c)
                                 
 
For Other Reasons.  It is agreed that the Company, or Employee, may terminate this Agreement for any reason at any time upon written notice to the other party.  Except as provided in Paragraph 4, this Agreement shall no longer be of any force and effect as of the date of such notice or such other date as may be agreed by the Company and the Employee (herein called the "Termination Date").  If either party terminates this Agreement, the Company may relieve the Employee of all duties and responsibilities effective on the date of notice.
(d)
                                
 
Upon termination of this Agreement by the Company, except for the provisions of Paragraph 4, the Employee's employment under the terms of this Agreement and all other agreements and contracts between the Employee, the Company and the Company's Affiliate and subsidiary corporations, shall be terminated effective on the Termination Date.  Should the Company terminate this Agreement prior to the end of the term of this Agreement, for reasons other than for Cause or Medical Disability, it shall pay to the Employee, one year of the base salary set forth in Paragraph 5.01 above in effect on the date of the notice (which shall constitute payment in full of the compensation due to the Employee hereunder).  Any such payments shall be made in twelve (12) equal monthly installments with the first such installment due and payable not later than thirty (30) days after the Termination Date.  Such payments made by the Company to the Employee are herein called "Termination Compensation."  In the event the Employee accepts or begins other employment as an employee, consultant or in any other capacity prior to the date on which the twelfth monthly installment of Termination Compensation is due and payable, the monthly payments of any unpaid balance of the Termination Compensation as of the date of such new employment shall be (i) eliminated if the monthly base salary and all other monthly remuneration and compensation from the new employment exceeds the monthly base salary of the Employee in effect on the date of the notice, or (ii) reduced to the amount by which the monthly base salary of the Employee in effect on the date of the notice exceeds the monthly base salary and all other monthly remuneration and compensation from the new employment.  The Employee agrees to pursue reasonable, good faith efforts to obtain other employment in a position suitable to his background and experience.  Moreover, the Employee agrees to notify the
6.02.
                       
 
Company within three business days of obtaining other employment during the time period in which he is receiving Termination Compensation.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Company terminates this Agreement for reasons other than for Cause, or if the Agreement is terminated as a result of the Employee's Death or Medical Disability, the Employee shall be entitled to receive as additional Termination Compensation an amount equal to the pro rata share of the bonus, or the full bonus, as the case may be, if any, under and subject to the terms and conditions of the Target Bonus Plan referred to in Section 5.02(a).  This payment is equal to the amount, if any, the Employee would have received following the end of the fiscal year if the Target Bonus Plan did not have a requirement that the Employee be employed by the Company at the time the bonus is customarily paid.  Such payment shall be made to the Employee at the same time the Company makes payments to other participants in the Target Bonus Plan.
6.03.
                       
 
On the Termination Date or at the end of the term of this Agreement, the Employee agrees that he will resign as an officer and director of the Company, its Affiliate and subsidiary corporations (if and when elected), and from any other positions, which resignations shall become effective on the Termination Date.
6.04.
                       
 
After the Termination Date or the end of the term of this Agreement, the Employee covenants to render further advice and assistance to the Company as may be required from time to time, and to provide all information available to him on matters handled by and through him while employed by the Company or of which he has personal knowledge, and by making available to the Company at reasonable times and circumstances, upon request by the Company, information pertinent to its operations in his possession; and, to the extent that it is necessary, to cooperate with and assist the Company to conclude any matters that are pending and which may require his assistance; provided, that he shall be paid reasonable compensation by the Company in the event he is required to expend time in the performance of such services; and provided further, that the Employee may perform such services in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with other employment obtained by the Employee.  The Employee shall be reimbursed for any expenses incurred by him in the performance of the covenants herein set forth in this Section 6.05.
6.05.
                       
 
In addition, the Employee agrees to cooperate with and provide assistance to the Company and its legal counsel in connection with any litigation (including arbitration or administrative hearings) or investigation affecting the Company, in which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company's counsel, the Employee's assistance or cooperation is needed.  The Employee shall, when requested by the Company, provide testimony or other assistance and shall travel at the Company's request in order to fulfill this obligation.  In connection with such litigation or investigation, the Company shall attempt to accommodate the Employee's schedule, shall reimburse the Employee (unless prohibited by law) for any actual loss wages in connection therewith, shall provide the Employee with reasonable notice in advance of the times in which the Employee's cooperation or assistance is needed, and shall reimburse the Employee for any reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such matters.
 
After the Termination Date or the end of the term of this Agreement, the Employee agrees not to make any statements to the Company's employees, customers or suppliers or to any public or media source, whether written or oral, regarding the Employee's employment or termination from the Company's employment, except as may be approved in writing by an executive officer of the Company in advance.  The Employee further agrees not to make any statement (including to any media source, or to the Company's suppliers, customers or employees) or take any action that would disrupt, impair, embarrass, harm or affect adversely the Group or any of their employees, officers, directors, or customers, or place the Group or such individuals in any negative light.
6.06.
                       
 
.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of any successor to or assignee of the Company, and the Employee specifically agrees on demand to execute any and all necessary documents in connection with the performance of this Agreement.  No waiver by either party of any breach by the other of any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any such or other provision of this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid or unenforceable as a matter of law, such invalidity or
7.
                                      
Special Provisions
 
unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement or of the remainder of this Agreement as a whole.
 
This Agreement sets forth all of the terms of the understanding between the parties with reference to the subject matter set forth herein and may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.
 
.  Because the Employee's services are unique and because the Employee has access to Confidential Information, the parties agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any breach by the Employee of any of the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Agreement.  In the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Agreement, the Company or its successors or assigns may, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive relief or other equitable relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of any such provision (without posting a bond or other security).  In addition to the foregoing and not in any way in limitation thereof, or in limitation of any right or remedy otherwise available to the Company, if the Employee violates any provision of paragraph 4 of this Agreement, any compensation, benefits and/or Termination Compensation then or thereafter due from the Company to the Employee shall be terminated forthwith and the Company's obligation to pay or provide and the Employee's right to receive such compensation, benefits and/or Termination Compensation shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, in each case without limiting or affecting the Employee's obligations under such paragraphs 4 or the Company's other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.
8.
                                      
Enforcement
 
.  The Employee agrees that any claim against the Company or any of its Affiliates or their employees arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or to the Employee's employment with the Company, shall be brought exclusively in the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina or the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, and in no other forum.  Employee hereby irrevocably consents to the personal

Governing Law and Forum Selection
 
and subject matter jurisdiction of these courts for the purpose of adjudicating any claims subject to this forum selection clause.  Employee also agrees that any dispute of any kind arising out of or relating to this Agreement or to the Employee's employment shall at the Company's sole election or demand be submitted to final, conclusive and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator and according to the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, which election or demand may be made by the Company at any time prior to the last day to answer and/or respond to a summons and/or complaint or counterclaim made by the Employee.  The results of any such arbitration proceeding shall be final and binding both upon the Company and upon the Employee, and shall be subject to judicial confirmation as provided by the Federal Arbitration Act or the North Carolina Arbitration Act, including specifically the terms of N.C. Gen. Stat.  1-567.2, which are incorporated herein by reference.  This Agreement shall be construed according to the substantive laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to conflict of laws principles.
 
.  Any notice or other communications to be given hereunder shall be deemed to have been given or delivered when delivered by hand to the individuals named below or when deposited in United States mail, registered or certified, with proper postage and registration or certification fees prepaid, addressed to the parties as follows (or to such other address as one party shall give the other in the manner provided herein):
