For Immediate Release
 
 Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) announced today it has successfully raised $250 million through a private placement of senior notes (the "Notes") to a group of institutional accredited investors.  As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors recently authorized the Company to purchase from time to time, as market conditions warrant, up to $300 million of the Company's Common Stock, in addition to prior authorizations.  The proceeds from the financing will be used to repurchase the Company's Common Stock.  The purchases could be made in the open market, in private transactions, or otherwise.
MATTHEWS, NC, September 28, 2005
