Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
At the close of business on October 3, 2005, Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into an Enhanced Overnight Share Repurchase Agreement (the "OSR Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. (the "Bank") pursuant to which on October 4, 2005, the Company repurchased ten million shares of the Company's common stock (the "Shares"), equivalent to approximately 6% of its outstanding common stock.
 
The initial purchase price for the Shares was $19.97 per share or $199,700,000.  The acquisition of the Shares was funded from the proceeds of the Company's issuance of $250 million in senior notes due September 27, 2015, as announced in the Company's press release on September 28, 2005, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 99 to the Company's report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that same day.
 
Pursuant to the OSR Agreement, the Bank will purchase ten million Shares in the open market over the next approximately three to five months, and upon completion of such purchases, the Company will either pay to or receive from the Bank the difference between the initial purchase price and the weighted average price of the Shares acquired by the Bank during such trading period (the "Price Adjustment").   The Company has mitigated its risk with respect to increases in the price of its Shares by purchasing a cap on the Price Adjustment with respect to five million of the repurchased Shares.  This cap is equal to 115% of the Bank's average price of Shares acquired in order to set the amount of the Bank's hedge in the days immediately following the Company's repurchase transaction.  The Company may fulfill its Price Adjustment payment obligations to the Bank, if any, in either cash or by the delivery of Shares to the Bank.  The Shares repurchased by the Company pursuant to the OSR Agreement will become authorized but unissued shares.
 
The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the OSR Agreement, and reference is made to the complete agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Company issued a press release on October 4, 2005, regarding the transaction described above, a copy which is filed as Exhibit 99 to this report and which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 9.01   Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The Company also acknowledges and agrees that any amendment, modification, waiver or termination of this Letter Agreement must be effected in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any such amendment, modification, waiver or termination shall be made in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act, and no such amendment, modification or waiver shall be made at any time at which the Company or any officer or director of the Company is aware of any material nonpublic information regarding the Company or the Common Stock.
(a)
                                 
In the event that the Seller reasonably determines that it is appropriate with regard to any legal, regulatory or self-regulatory requirements or related policies and procedures (whether or not such requirements, policies or procedures are imposed by law or have been voluntarily adopted by the Seller, and including without limitation Rule 10b-18, Rule 10b-5, Regulation 13D-G and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, ""), for the Seller to refrain from purchasing Common Stock or to purchase fewer than the number of shares of Common Stock that the Seller would otherwise purchase on any Trading Day during the Averaging Period or, if the Settlement Amount is greater than zero, the Valuation Period, then the Seller may, in its discretion, elect that the Averaging Period or the Valuation Period, as the case may be, be suspended as appropriate with regard to any Requirements.  The Seller shall notify the Company upon the exercise of the Seller's rights pursuant to this Section 3(b) and shall subsequently notify the Company on the day the Seller believes that the circumstances giving rise to such exercise have changed.  If the Averaging Period or the Valuation Period is suspended by the Seller pursuant to this Section 3(b), at the end of such suspension the Seller shall determine the number of Trading Days remaining in the Averaging Period or the Valuation Period, as the case may be, which number shall not exceed the Remaining Scheduled Days as of the time of such suspension.
(b)
                                
Requirements
 
The Company agrees that neither the Company nor any of its affiliates or agents shall take any action that would cause Regulation M to be applicable to any purchases of Common Stock, or any security for which the Common Stock is a reference security (as defined in Regulation M), by the Company or any of its affiliated purchasers (as defined in Regulation M) during the Averaging Period or, if the Settlement Amount is greater than zero, the Valuation Period.
(c)
                                 
 
From the date hereof through the last day of the Averaging Period or, if the Settlement Amount is greater than zero, through the last day of the Valuation Period, the Company shall (i) notify the Seller prior to the opening of trading in the Common Stock on any day on which the Company makes, or expects to be made, any public announcement (as defined in Rule 165(f) under the Securities Act) of any merger, acquisition, or similar transaction involving a recapitalization relating to the Company (other than any such transaction in which the consideration consists solely of cash and there is no valuation period), (ii) promptly notify the Seller following any such announcement that such announcement has been made, and (iii) promptly deliver to the Seller following the making of any such announcement a certificate indicating (A) the Company's average daily Rule 10b-18 purchases (as defined in Rule 10b-18) during the three full calendar months preceding the date of the announcement of such transaction and (B) the Company's block purchases (as defined in Rule 10b-18) effected pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 10b-18 during the three full calendar months preceding the date of the announcement of such transaction.  In addition, the Company shall promptly notify the Seller of the earlier to occur of the completion of such transaction and the completion of the vote by target shareholders.  The Company acknowledges that any such public announcement may cause the Averaging Period or Valuation Period, as the case may be, to be suspended pursuant to Section 3(b).  Accordingly, the Company acknowledges that its actions in relation to any such announcement or transaction must comply with the standards set forth in Section 3(a).
(d)

convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock during the period beginning on, and including, the Purchase Date and ending on, and including, the date all payments or deliveries of shares pursuant to Section 5 below have been made.  During such time, any purchases of Common Stock (or any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) by the Company shall be made through BAS, which is an affiliate of the Seller, pursuant to a letter substantially in the form of Appendix A hereto and subject to such conditions as the Seller shall impose, and shall be in compliance with Rule 10b-18 or otherwise in a manner that the Company and the Seller believe is in compliance with applicable requirements (including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5, Regulation 13D-G and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act).

Re:
                              
Enhanced
Overnight Share Repurchase
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Reference is made to the Overnight Share Repurchase Letter Agreement between you and Bank of America, N.A. dated as of October 3, 2005 (the "").  Capitalized terms used without definition in this letter have the definitions assigned to them in the Agreement.
Agreement
 
In accordance with Section 4 of the Agreement, the Seller agrees that Company may purchase shares of Common Stock during the Averaging Period subject to the following procedures:
 
all such purchases will be made by Banc of America Securities LLC ("") in accordance with Rule 10b-18(b) or otherwise in a manner that Company and BAS believe is in compliance with applicable requirements;
(i)
                                    
BAS
 
each purchase order Company places with BAS will be an all or nothing order to purchase a minimum of 10,000 shares;
(ii)
                                 
 
Company will pay to BAS a $0.02 per share commission for each share of Common Stock purchased; and
(iii)
                              
 
Company agrees that, in purchasing shares of Common Stock, BAS may purchase shares of Common Stock for the account of the Seller, which is an affiliate of BAS, other than any single block of 10,000 or more shares of Common Stock, without your prior consent; you acknowledge that, because any orders you place pursuant to the above procedures will be all or nothing orders, other orders to purchase Common Stock (including orders placed by the Seller or BAS) may reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for purchase and may therefore impact your ability to obtain execution of any such all or nothing orders.
(iv)
                             
We may terminate this letter agreement upon the effectiveness of any change in applicable law or regulation that would cause the procedures set forth herein to impede our ability to execute appropriate trading transactions in relation to our obligations under the Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 3(a) of the Agreement) in a manner consistent with applicable law and regulation.
 
Please indicate your agreement to, and acknowledgment of, the above by signing and returning to us a copy of this letter.

The Company has limited its potential financial exposure in the event of an increase in its share price above a cap during the purchase period. The cap will be applied to 5 million of the 10 million shares repurchased and is equal to approximately 115% of the average price of the common stock over a limited number of trading days immediately following the date of the transaction.
 
and to be in the range of $0.30 and $0.32 per share for the first quarter.
