For Immediate Release
 
 
MATTHEWS, NC, December 21, 2005Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), reported that net income per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 ended November 26, 2005, was $0.32 compared with $0.32 for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 ended November 27, 2004.  Net income for the first quarter was $51.4 million, or 5.5% below net income of $54.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
 
"Last year, our Company made significant investments in four key initiatives:  the installation of refrigerated coolers, the Urban Initiative, the Treasure Hunt merchandise program, and new stores.  This year, we are accelerating investment in initiatives that performed well and are focusing efforts to improve initiatives that did not fully meet our expectations," said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "While the macro-economic environment continues to be challenging for our customers, we are executing against our plan and experiencing positive results.  In the first quarter, we increased profitability in our Urban Initiative markets and opened 73 new stores as planned.  We installed refrigerated coolers in approximately 400 stores and improved the coordination of merchandising, marketing and store operations in support of our Treasure Hunt initiative.  I am pleased with the improvements we have made this quarter, and I believe that with the support and commitment of all our hardworking Associates, these initiatives will position us well for future profitable growth."
 
As previously reported, sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were approximately $1.511billion, or 9.5% above sales of approximately $1.380 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2005.  Sales in comparable stores increased approximately 3.0%.  The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, decreased approximately 2.1%, and the average transaction increased approximately 5.1% to $9.36.
 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma struck the U.S. Gulf Coast and Florida, impacting numerous stores in the afflicted areas.  Since the Company's stores are widely dispersed, lost sales due to closed stores resulting from damage or power outages were generally limited and were offset by increased sales in other stores.  The most significant storm-related losses were related to the loss of merchandise inventories, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements at individual stores in the paths of the storms.  The Company expects the majority of the losses incurred will be covered by insurance.
 
The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 33.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to 33.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.  As a percentage of sales, lower inventory shrinkage and improved initial merchandise mark-up offset higher freight costs resulting from higher fuel costs and slightly higher markdown expense.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 28.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 from 27.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.  The increase, as a percentage of sales, was a
 
result of higher occupancy costs, insurance costs and compensation expense related to stock-based compensation.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R ("SFAS 123R") for its share-based compensation plans.  Under SFAS 123R, all share-based compensation cost is recognized as an expense in the income statement.  Results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 did not include any stock-based compensation.
 
On September 27, 2005, the Company obtained $250 million through a private placement under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of unsecured Senior Notes (the "Notes") to a group of institutional accredited investors.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company recorded interest expense of approximately $2.2 million related to the Notes.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $1.3 million.  The Company had no outstanding debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
 
On October 4, 2005, the Company executed an overnight share repurchase transaction with a bank for the acquisition of ten million shares, or approximately 6%, of the Company's outstanding Common Stock.  The transaction was financed with the proceeds of the Notes.  There were no other purchases of Common Stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2006.  As of November 26, 2005, the Company had approximately 6.9 million shares authorized to be purchased.
 
The Company's inventories at November 26, 2005, were $1,110.8 million, or 7.6% above inventories of $1,032.8 million at November 27, 2004.  Inventory on a per store basis at November 26, 2005, was relatively flat compared with inventory on a per store basis at November 27, 2004.
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, capital expenditures were $48.8 million compared with $43.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company opened 73 new stores and closed 19 stores.
 
Outlook
 
For the fiscal year ending August 26, 2006, the Company expects comparable store sales to increase 2% to 4%.  The Company believes that higher transportation expense resulting from higher fuel costs and the impact of a continued mix shift toward lower-margin consumable merchandise will continue to pressure gross profit margin in fiscal 2006.  In addition, the Company expects that operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, will be higher in fiscal 2006, reflecting higher occupancy costs, increased compensation expense associated with stock-based compensation, and the continued funding of the Urban Initiative program.  Using these assumptions, the Company expects earnings per share to be between $1.30 and $1.39, including the impact of the expensing of stock options as required by SFAS 123R and other new compensation programs, and including the accretive benefit of the Company's share repurchase program.
 
As previously announced, the Company's comparable store sales plan for the month of December is an increase of 2% to 4%.  The biggest shopping days of the season have not yet occurred, and results for the full month will be significantly impacted by the next several days.  If current sales trends continue, the Company expects comparable store sales for the month of December to increase 2% to 3%.  For the second quarter, the Company expects comparable store sales to increase 2% to 3% and expects earnings per share to be between $0.45 and $0.50.
