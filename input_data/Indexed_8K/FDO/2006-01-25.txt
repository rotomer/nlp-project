The terms, methods of exercise, methods of settlement, form of consideration payable in settlement, and any other terms and conditions of any Performance Awards shall be determined by the Committee.  For purposes of determining the number of Shares to be used in payment of a Performance Award denominated in cash but payable in whole or in part in Shares or Restricted Stock, the number of Shares to be so paid will be determined by dividing the cash value of the Award to be so paid by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of determination by the Committee of the amount of the payment under the Award, or, if the Committee so directs, the date immediately preceding the date the Award is paid.
9.4.
                             
OTHER TERMS
 
.  The Committee is authorized to make Awards of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units to Participants in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee, subject to Section 5.4.
10.1.
                       
GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
 
.  Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions on transferability and other restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without limitation, limitations on the right to vote Restricted Stock or the right to receive dividends on the Restricted Stock or dividend equivalents on the Restricted Stock Units) covering a period of time specified by the Committee (the "Restriction Period").  These restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times, under such circumstances, in such installments, upon the satisfaction of performance goals or otherwise, as the Committee determines at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter.  Except as otherwise provided in an Award Certificate, the Participant shall have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Stock, and the Participant shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to Restricted Stock Units until such time as Shares of Stock are paid in settlement of the Restricted Stock Units.
10.2.
                       
ISSUANCE AND RESTRICTIONS
 
.  Except as provided in an Award Certificate or otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter, immediately after termination of the Participant's employment or other service relationship with the Company and its Affiliates during the applicable Restriction Period or upon failure to satisfy a performance goal during the applicable Restriction Period, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that are at that time subject to restrictions shall be forfeited.
10.3.
                       
FORFEITURE
 
.  Shares of Restricted Stock shall be delivered to the Participant at the time of grant either by book-entry registration or by delivering to the Participant, or a custodian or escrow agent (including, without limitation, the Company or one or more of its employees) designated by the Committee, a stock certificate or certificates registered in the name of the Participant.  If physical certificates representing shares of Restricted Stock are registered in the name of the Participant, such certificates must bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock.
10.4.
                       
DELIVERY OF RESTRICTED STOCK
 
.  The Committee is authorized to grant Deferred Stock Units to Participants subject to such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee.  Deferred Stock Units shall entitle the Participant to receive Shares of Stock (or the equivalent value in cash or other property if so determined by the Committee) at a future time as determined by the Committee, or as determined by the Participant within guidelines established by the Committee in the case of voluntary deferral elections.
11.1.
                       
GRANT OF DEFERRED STOCK UNITS
 
.  The Committee is authorized to grant Dividend Equivalents to Participants subject to such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee.  Dividend Equivalents shall entitle the Participant to receive payments equal in value to the cash dividends that would have been paid with respect to all or a portion of the number of Shares subject to any Award, if such Shares had been outstanding, as determined by the Committee.  The Committee may provide that Dividend Equivalents be paid or distributed when accrued or be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares or units equivalent to Shares, or otherwise reinvested.
12.1.
                       
GRANT OF DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS
 
.  The Committee is authorized to grant Interest Equivalents to Participants subject to such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee.  Interest Equivalents shall entitle the Participant to receive payments equal to a stated rate of return on the value of an outstanding Award, as determined by the Committee.  The Committee may provide that Interest Equivalents be paid or distributed when accrued or be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares or units equivalent to Shares, or otherwise reinvested.
12.2
                          
GRANT OF INTEREST EQUIVALENTS
 
.  The Committee is authorized, subject to limitations under applicable law, to grant to Participants such other Awards that are payable in, valued in whole or in part by
13.1.
                       
GRANT OF STOCK OR OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS
 
reference to, or otherwise based on or related to Shares or other property, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan, including without limitation Shares awarded purely as a "bonus" and not subject to any restrictions or conditions, convertible or exchangeable debt securities, other rights convertible or exchangeable into Shares, and Awards valued by reference to book value of Shares or the value of securities of or the performance of specified Parents or Affiliates ("Other Stock-Based Awards").  Such Other Stock-Based Awards shall also be available as a form of payment in the settlement of other Awards granted under the Plan.  The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Other Stock-Based Awards.
 
.  The provisions of the Plan are intended to ensure that all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights granted hereunder to any Covered Employee shall qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption.
14.1.
                       
OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
 
.  When granting an Award other than an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right, the Committee may designate such Award as a Qualified Performance-Based Award, based upon a determination that the recipient is or may be a Covered Employee with respect to such Award, and the Committee wishes such Award to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption.  If an Award is so designated, the Committee shall establish performance goals for such Award within the time period prescribed by Section 162(m) of the Code based on one or more of the following Qualified Business Criteria, which may be expressed in terms of Company-wide objectives or in terms of objectives that relate to the performance of an Affiliate or a division, region, department, function or combination thereof within the Company or an Affiliate:
14.2.

Performance goals with respect to the foregoing Qualified Business Criteria may be specified in absolute terms, in percentages, or in terms of growth from period to period or growth rates over time, as well as measured relative to an established or specially-created performance index of Company competitors or peers.  Any member of a specially-created performance index that undergoes a corporate event or transaction of a kind described in Article 16 or that files a petition for bankruptcy during a measurement period shall be disregarded from and after such event, unless the Committee determines not to disregard such entity or to make some other adjustment to measuring the performance index and the effect of such Committee determination is to reduce the amount payable under any affected Qualified Performance-Based Award.  Performance goals need not be based upon an increase or positive result under a business criterion and could include, for example, the maintenance of the status quo or the limitation of economic losses (measured, in each case, by reference to a specific business criterion).  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Committee may exercise, with respect to such Qualified Business Criteria and related performance goals, such negative discretion as is permitted under applicable law for purposes of the Section 162(m) Exemption.
 
.  Each Qualified Performance-Based Award (other than a market-priced Option or SAR) shall be earned, vested and payable (as applicable) only upon the achievement of performance goals established by the Committee based upon one or more of the Qualified Business Criteria, together with the satisfaction of any other conditions, such as continued employment, as the Committee may determine to be appropriate; provided, however, that the Committee may provide, either in connection with the grant thereof or by amendment thereafter, that achievement of such performance goals will be waived upon the death or Disability of the Participant, or upon a Change in Control. Performance periods established by the Committee for any such Qualified Performance-Based Award may be as short as three months and may be any longer period.  In addition, the Committee may reserve the right, in connection with
14.3.
                       
PERFORMANCE GOALS
 
the grant of a Qualified Performance-Based Award, to exercise negative discretion to determine that the portion of such Award actually earned, vested and/or payable (as applicable) shall be less than the portion that would be earned, vested and/or payable based solely upon application of the applicable performance goals.
 
.  The Committee may determine prospectively, at the time that goals under this Article 14 are established, whether or not to adjust any such goals during or after the fiscal year period to take into consideration and/or mitigate the unbudgeted impact of unusual or non-recurring gains and losses, accounting changes, acquisitions, dispositions, divestitures, and/or "extraordinary items" within the meaning of generally accepted accounting principles ("non-recurring items"), or if such non-recurring items were not foreseen or were not quantifiable at the time such goals were established, upon the occurrence of such non-recurring items, including any of the following that occur during a fiscal year period: (a) asset write-downs or impairment charges; (b) litigation or claim costs, judgments or settlements; (c) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting principles or other laws or provisions affecting reported results; (d) restatements occurring as a result of errors that arise from events other than fraud or failures in performance; (e) accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs; (f) extraordinary nonrecurring items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 and/or in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in the Company's annual report to stockholders for the applicable year; (g) acquisitions or divestitures; and (h) foreign exchange gains and losses.
14.4.
                       
INCLUSIONS AND EXCLUSIONS FROM PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
 
.  Any payment of a Qualified Performance-Based Award granted with performance goals pursuant to Section 14.3 above shall be conditioned on the written certification of the Committee in each case that the performance goals and any other material conditions were satisfied.  Except as specifically provided in Section 14.3, no Qualified Performance-Based Award held by a Covered Employee or by an employee who in the reasonable judgment of the Committee may be a Covered Employee on the date of payment, may be amended, nor may the Committee exercise any discretionary authority it may otherwise have under the Plan with respect to a Qualified Performance-Based Award under the Plan, in any manner to waive the achievement of the applicable performance goal based on Qualified Business Criteria or to increase the amount payable pursuant thereto or the value thereof, or otherwise in a manner that would cause the Qualified Performance-Based Award to cease to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption.
14.5.
                       
CERTIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE GOALS
 
.  Awards granted under the Plan may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition to, in tandem with, any other Award granted under the Plan.  Subject to Section 17.2, Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards may be granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the grant of such other Awards.
15.1.
                       
STAND-ALONE AND TANDEM AWARDS
 
.  The term of each Award shall be for the period as determined by the Committee, provided that in no event shall the term of any Option or a Stock Appreciation Right exceed a period of ten years from its Grant Date (or, if Section 7.2(d) applies, five years from its Grant Date).
15.2.
                       
TERM OF AWARD
 
.  Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable law (including, but not limited Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) or Award Certificate, payments or transfers to be made by the Company or an Affiliate on the grant or exercise of an Award may be made in such form as the Committee determines at or after the Grant Date, including without limitation, cash, Stock, other Awards, or other property, or any combination, and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments, or on a deferred basis, in each case determined in accordance with rules adopted by, and at the discretion of, the Committee.
15.3.
                       
FORM OF PAYMENT FOR AWARDS
 
.  No right or interest of a Participant in any unexercised or restricted Award may be pledged, encumbered, or hypothecated to or in favor of any party other than the Company or an Affiliate, or shall be subject to any lien, obligation, or liability of such Participant to any other party other than the Company or an Affiliate.  No unexercised or restricted Award shall be assignable or transferable by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that the Committee may (but need not) permit other transfers where the Committee concludes that such transferability (i) does not result in accelerated taxation, (ii) does not cause any Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option to fail to be described in Code Section 422(b), and (iii) is otherwise appropriate and desirable, taking into account any factors deemed relevant, including without limitation, state or federal tax or securities laws applicable to transferable Awards.  Any purported transfer in violation of this Section 15.4 shall be null and void.
15.4.
                       
LIMITS ON TRANSFER
 
.  Notwithstanding Section 15.4, a Participant may, in the manner determined by the Committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Participant and to receive any distribution with respect to any Award upon the Participant's death.  A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative, or other person claiming any rights under the Plan is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award Certificate applicable to the Participant, except to the extent the Plan and Award Certificate otherwise provide, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.  If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Participant, payment shall be made to the Participant's surviving spouse or, in the
15.5.
                       
BENEFICIARIES
 
absence of a surviving spouse, to the Participant's estate.  Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary designation may be changed or revoked by a Participant at any time provided the change or revocation is filed with the Company.
 
.  All Stock issuable under the Plan is subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee deems necessary or advisable to comply with federal or state securities laws, rules and regulations and the rules of any national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Stock is listed, quoted, or traded.  The Committee may place legends on any Stock certificate or issue instructions to the transfer agent to reference restrictions applicable to the Stock.
15.6.
                       
STOCK CERTIFICATES
 
.  The provisions of this Section 15.7 shall apply in the case of a Change in Control, unless otherwise provided in the Award Certificate or any special Plan document or separate agreement with a Participant governing an Award.
15.7.
                       
EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL
 
.  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, and except with respect to any Awards assumed by the Surviving Entity or otherwise equitably converted or substituted in connection with the Change in Control in a manner approved by the Committee or the Board: (i) outstanding Options, SARs, and other Awards in the nature of rights that may be exercised shall become fully exercisable and shall remain exercisable for their full term, (ii) time-based vesting restrictions on outstanding Awards shall lapse, and (iii) the target payout opportunities attainable under outstanding performance-based Awards shall be deemed to have been fully earned as of the effective date of the Change in Control based upon the greater of:  (A) an assumed achievement of all relevant performance goals at the "target" level, or (B) the actual level of achievement of all relevant performance goals against target as of the Company's fiscal quarter end preceding the Change in Control, and, in either such case, there shall be a prorata payout to Participants within thirty (30) days following the Change in Control based upon the length of time within the performance period that has elapsed prior to the Change in Control.  Any Awards shall thereafter continue or lapse in accordance with the other provisions of the Plan and the Award Certificate.  To the extent that this provision causes Incentive Stock Options to exceed the dollar limitation set forth in Section 7.2(b), the excess Options shall be deemed to be Nonstatutory Stock Options.
(a)
                                 
Awards not Assumed or Substituted by Surviving Entity
 
.  With respect to Awards assumed by the Surviving Entity or otherwise equitably converted or substituted in connection with a Change in Control, unless the Award Certificate expressly provides otherwise: if within two years after the effective date of the Change in Control, a Participant's employment is terminated without Cause or the Participant resigns for Good Reason, then (i) all of that Participant's outstanding Options, SARs and other Awards in the nature of rights that may be exercised shall become fully exercisable and shall remain exercisable for their full term, (ii)
(b)
                                
Awards Assumed or Substituted by Surviving Entity
 
all time-based vesting restrictions outstanding Awards shall lapse, and (iii) the target payout opportunities attainable under all outstanding of that Participant's performance-based Awards shall be deemed to have been fully earned as of the date of termination based upon the greater of: (A) an assumed achievement of all relevant performance goals at the "target" level, or (B) the actual level of achievement of all relevant performance goals against target as of the Company's fiscal quarter end preceding the Change in Control, and, in either such case, there shall be a prorata payout to such Participant within thirty (30) days following the date of termination of employment based upon the length of time within the performance period that has elapsed prior to the date of termination of employment.  Any Awards shall thereafter continue or lapse in accordance with the other provisions of the Plan and the Award Certificate.  To the extent that this provision causes Incentive Stock Options to exceed the dollar limitation set forth in Section 7.2(b), the excess Options shall be deemed to be Nonstatutory Stock Options.
 
(c) For purposes of Section 15.7 (a) and (b), "target" shall mean the amount of the performance-based Award initially granted to a Participant as a "target" amount to be awarded subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Award.
 
.  Regardless of whether an event has occurred as described in Section 15.7 above, and subject to Article 14 as to Qualified Performance-Based Awards, the Committee may in its sole discretion at any time determine that, upon the termination of service of a Participant, or the occurrence of a Change in Control, all or a portion of such Participant's Options, SARs and other Awards in the nature of rights that may be exercised shall become fully or partially exercisable, that all or a part of the restrictions on all or a portion of the Participant's outstanding Awards shall lapse, and/or that any performance-based criteria with respect to any Awards held by that Participant shall be deemed to be wholly or partially satisfied, in each case, as of such date as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, declare.  The Committee may discriminate among Participants and among Awards granted to a Participant in exercising its discretion pursuant to this Section 15.8.
15.8.
                       
DISCRETIONARY ACCELERATION
 
.  The Committee shall be entitled to make such rules, regulations, and determinations as it deems appropriate under this Plan in respect of any leave of absence taken by an employee or any other change in employment status, such as a change from full time employment to a consulting relationship, of an employee relative to an Award. Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee shall be entitled to determine (i) whether or not any such leave of absence or other change in employment status, including the receipt of continuing payments provided pursuant to a written severance or employment agreement, shall constitute a termination of employment within the meaning of this Plan and (ii) the impact, if any, of any such leave of absence or other change in employment status on Awards under this Plan therefore made to any employee who takes such leave of absence or otherwise changes his or her employment status.  To the extent that this provision causes Incentive
15.9.
                       
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
 
Stock Options to extend beyond three months from the date a Participant is deemed to cease to be an employee of the Company, a Parent or Subsidiary for purposes of Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code, the Options held by such Participant shall be deemed to be Nonstatutory Stock Options.
 
.  The Committee may specify in an Award Certificate that the Participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Such events may include, but are not limited to, termination of employment for Cause, violation of material Company or Affiliate policies, breach of non-competition, confidentiality or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company or any Affiliate.
15.10.
                 
FORFEITURE EVENTS
 
.  The Committee may grant Awards under the Plan in substitution for stock and stock-based awards held by employees of another entity who become employees of the Company or an Affiliate as a result of a merger or consolidation of the former employing entity with the Company or an Affiliate or the acquisition by the Company or an Affiliate of property or stock of the former employing corporation.  The Committee may direct that the substitute awards be granted on such terms and conditions as the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances.
15.11.
                 
SUBSTITUTE AWARDS
 
.  In the event of a corporate event or transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares), the authorization limits under Section 5.1 and 5.4 shall be adjusted proportionately, and the Committee may adjust the Plan and Awards to preserve the benefits or potential benefits of the Awards.  Action by the Committee may include: (i) adjustment of the number and kind of shares which may be delivered under the Plan; (ii) adjustment of the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Awards; (iii) adjustment of the exercise price of outstanding Awards or the measure to be used to determine the amount of the benefit payable on an Award; and (iv) any other adjustments that the Committee determines to be equitable.  In addition, upon the occurrence or in anticipation of such an event, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide (i) that Awards will be settled in cash rather than Stock, (ii) that Awards will become immediately vested and exercisable and will expire after a designated period of time to the extent not then exercised, (iii) that Awards will be assumed by another party to a transaction or otherwise be equitably converted or substituted in connection with such transaction, (iv) that outstanding Awards may be settled by payment in cash or cash equivalents equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the underlying Stock, as of a specified date associated with the transaction, over the exercise price of the Award, (v) that performance targets and performance periods for Performance Awards will be modified, consistent with Code Section 162(m) where applicable, or (vi) any combination
16.1.
                       
GENERAL
 
  To the extent that any adjustments made pursuant to this Article 15 cause Incentive Stock Options to cease to qualify as Incentive Stock Options, such Options shall be deemed to be Nonstatutory Stock Options.
of the foregoing.  The Committee's determination need not be uniform and may be different for different Participants whether or not such Participants are similarly situated.  Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Stock (stock-split), a declaration of a dividend payable in Shares, or a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Stock into a lesser number of Shares, the authorization limits under Section 5.1 and 5.4 shall automatically be adjusted proportionately, and the Shares then subject to each Award shall automatically be adjusted proportionately without any change in the aggregate purchase price therefore.

17.1.
                       
AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION
 
The Board or the Committee may, at any time and from time to time, amend, modify or terminate the Plan without stockholder approval; provided, however, that if an amendment to the Plan would, in the reasonable opinion of the Board or the Committee, either (i) materially increase the number of Shares available under the Plan, (ii) expand the types of awards under the Plan, (iii) materially expand the class of participants eligible to participate in the Plan, (iv) materially extend the term of the Plan, or (v) otherwise constitute a material change requiring stockholder approval under applicable laws or the applicable listing or other requirements of an Exchange, then such amendment shall be subject to stockholder approval; and provided, further, that the Board or Committee may condition any amendment or modification on the approval of stockholders of the Company for any reason, including by reason of such approval being necessary or deemed advisable to (i) to comply with the listing or other requirements of an Exchange, or (ii) to satisfy any other tax, securities or other applicable laws, policies or regulations.
(a)
                                 
 
No termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the Participant affected thereby.  An outstanding Award shall not be deemed to be "adversely affected" by a Plan amendment if such amendment would not reduce or diminish the value of such Award determined as if the Award had been exercised, vested, cashed in or otherwise settled on the date of such amendment (with the per-share value of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right for this purpose being calculated as the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value as of the date of such amendment over the exercise price or base value of such Award).
(b)
                                
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to amend the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan, by action of the Board or
(c)
                                 
 
the Committee, without the consent of any affected Participant, to the extent deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of maintaining compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
.  At any time and from time to time, the Committee may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award without approval of the Participant; provided, however:
17.2.
                       
AWARDS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED
 
Subject to the terms of the applicable Award Certificate, such amendment, modification or termination shall not, without the Participant's consent, reduce or diminish the value of such Award determined as if the Award had been exercised, vested, cashed in or otherwise settled on the date of such amendment or termination (with the per-share value of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right for this purpose being calculated as the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value as of the date of such amendment or termination over the exercise or base price of such Award);
(a)
                                 
 
The original term of an Option may not be extended without the prior approval of the stockholders of the Company; and
(b)
                                
 
Except as otherwise provided in Article 16, the exercise price of an Option may not be reduced, directly or indirectly, without the prior approval of the stockholders of the Company.
(c)
                                 
 
.  No Participant or any Eligible Individual shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan.  Neither the Company, its Affiliates nor the Committee is obligated to treat Participants or Eligible Individuals uniformly, and determinations made under the Plan may be made by the Committee selectively among Eligible Individuals who receive, or are eligible to receive, Awards (whether or not such Eligible Individuals are similarly situated).
18.1.
                       
NO RIGHTS TO AWARDS; NON-UNIFORM DETERMINATIONS
 
.  No Award gives a Participant any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company unless and until Shares are in fact issued to such Participant in connection with the Award.
18.2.
                       
NO STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS
 
.  The Company or any Affiliate shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any exercise, lapse of restriction or other taxable event arising as a result of the Plan or an Award.  If Shares are permitted to be surrendered to the Company to satisfy tax obligations in excess of the minimum tax withholding obligation, such Shares must have been held by the Participant
18.3.
                       
WITHHOLDING
 
as fully vested shares for such period of time, if any, as necessary to avoid the recognition of an expense under generally accepted accounting principles.  The Company shall have the authority to require a Participant to remit cash to the Company in lieu of the surrender of Shares for tax withholding obligations if the surrender of Shares in satisfaction of such withholding obligations would result in the Company's recognition of expense under generally accepted accounting principles.  With respect to withholding required upon any taxable event under the Plan, the Committee may, at the time the Award is granted or thereafter, require or permit that any such withholding requirement be satisfied, in whole or in part, by withholding from the Award Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding equal to the minimum amount (and not any greater amount) required to be withheld for tax purposes.
 
.  Nothing in the Plan, any Award Certificate or any other document or statement made with respect to the Plan, shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate any Participant's employment or status as an officer, director or consultant at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue as an employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any Affiliate, whether for the duration of a Participant's Award or otherwise.

ARBITRATION

Exhibit 10.2
 
1.
Purpose
                                     
 
Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (the "Company") is adopting for the benefit of eligible individuals the Family Dollar Stores, Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan(the "Plan"),which is intended to provide flexibility to the Company in its ability to motivate, attract, and retain the services of such individuals upon whose judgment, interest, and special effort the successful conduct of the Company's operation is largely dependent.  These (the "Guidelines") are intended to implement the Plan by providing eligible Associates of the Company with an opportunity to participate in the Company's success by earning long-term incentive compensation awards in the form of shares of Company Stock ("Common Stock") within the framework of the Plan (the "Performance Share Rights Awards" or the "Awards"), and as further described in these Guidelines.
Guidelines for Long-Term Incentive Performance Share Rights Awards
 
These Guidelines are adopted pursuant to relevant provisions of the Plan and are to be interpreted and applied in accordance with the terms and provisions thereof.  Specifically, these Guidelines provide for the grant of Performance Share Rights Awards under Article 9 of the Plan and, with respect to Associates in the position of Vice President or above, the grant of Qualified Performance-Based Awards under Article 14 of the Plan.  Unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized terms used in these Guidelines will have the meaning given such terms in the Plan.  If there is any conflict between these Guidelines and the Plan, the terms and provisions of the Plan shall control.
 
2.
Scope
                                     
 
The Guidelines cover Associates who are eligible for participation in the Plan under these Guidelines and are selected by the Committee for Performance Share Rights Awards identified in Section 1 above.  Awards under these Guidelines cover multiple (generally three) year  performance periods relating to such Awards which generally track the Company's fiscal (not calendar) year that is the 12-month period that generally runs from approximately September 1 to August 31.  The actual dates for the fiscal year are determined and announced by the Company at the beginning of each fiscal year.  See Section 7 below regarding transition periods.

3.
Eligibility
                                     
The Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee") and/or management of the Company will determine annually which Associates are eligible to receive Performance Share Rights Awards under these Guidelines.  Participants are selected no later than 90 days following the beginning of each performance period or upon employment with the Company or promotion.  Annual Performance Share Rights Awards under these Guidelines will result in overlapping performance periods.  Additional eligibility requirements are as follows:
 
An Associate who becomes eligible for a Performance Share Rights Award under these Guidelines after the beginning of a performance period, either because the Associate is newly hired or is promoted into a position covered by these Guidelines, will be granted a prorated Award for all pending performance periods as of the Associate's date of hire or effective date of promotion, other than any performance period that will lapse within six months of such date of hire or promotion.  Payments with respect to any such prorated Award will be based on the Company's performance (as described below) at the end of the relevant performance period and will be prorated by multiplying the number of Performance Shares Rights to which the Associate would have been entitled (had the Associate been a participant in the Plan on the first day of the performance period) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar months in the performance period from and after the date of hire or promotion (rounded up to the next full month for any partial month of service), and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar months in the performance period.
 - 
                 
 
An Associate covered by these Guidelines who has a job change that results in either a higher or lower Performance Share Rights Award under these Guidelines will have the Award for any pending performance period as of the date of the job change adjusted on a pro rata basis based on the number of months during the performance period in each such position.  For example, an Associate with a target Performance Share Rights Award of 1,000 shares who has a job change half way through a performance period to a job position with an Award of 1,500 Performance Share Rights will have an adjusted target Award for the performance period of 1,250 shares of Common Stock.
 - 
                 
 
These Guidelines do not in any manner restrict the right of the Company or the Associate to terminate employment at any time, for any reason, with or without cause.  See Section 5 below for further information on the consequences of termination of employment during a pending performance period.
 - 
                 
 
An Associate otherwise meeting all of the eligibility requirements of these Guidelines, but whose performance rating for a number of fiscal years representing at least half of the fiscal years covered by the performance period is at the Unsatisfactory/Does Not Meet Expectations level, will .
 - 
                 
not be eligible for any payout for that performance period
 
An Associate must be classified as a regular full-time employee during the entire performance period for which an Award is being made and at the time of the actual issuance of the Common Stock pursuant to the Performance Shares Rights Award in order to be issued Common Stock pursuant to an Award. An Associate on leave of absence, regardless of type, will be issued Common Stock pursuant to a Performance Share Rights Award only upon return to regular, full time work/active status; provided
 - 
                 
 
however, that an Associate on an approved family medical leave or approved military leave will be issued Common Stock pursuant to such Award at the time such shares are issued even if they have not returned to regular, full time work/active status at that time.
 
4.
Forms of Awards and Targets
                                     
 
At the time an Associate is selected for an Award under these Guidelines for a particular performance period, the Associate will be assigned a "target" number of shares of Common Stock to be earned if the Company's performance level is at the 50% level in comparison to the peer group (as set forth below) for the performance period.  The Award will be expressed as a number of Performance Shares Rights and will be evidenced by an Award Certificate consistent with the provisions of the Plan.  The actual payout for the performance period, if any, will be determined as a percentage of the target Award payout depending on Company performance as follows:
 
Company performance for each performance period will be based equally upon (i) the Company's average annual return on equity ("ROE") for each fiscal year during the performance period and (ii) the Company's pre-tax net income growth rate over the performance period, compounded annually.  For purposes of these Guidelines, ROE will be calculated by dividing the Company's pre-tax net income for the relevant fiscal year by the total shareholders' equity.
 - 
                 
 
Actual Company performance for each criteria above at the end of the relevant performance period is then measured against the performance of a peer group of companies selected prior to, or within 90 days after the beginning of, the performance period.  The Award levels for the relevant performance period will be adjusted at the end of the performance period to reflect the Company's performance relative to the peer group.  Any such adjustment will generally range from 0% (i.e., no payout for the performance period) to 200% of the target Award per the following chart (with linear interpolation between the thresholds set forth below):
 - 
                 
 
 
 
For example, if an Associate receives a target Performance Share Rights Award of 10,000 shares for a particular performance period, and the Company's ROE and pre-tax net income growth performance, as measured against the relevant peer group of companies, is in the 68 and 46 percentile, respectively, then the Associate would receive an actual payout of 11,300 shares of Common  Stock, as described below:
 - 
                 
th
th
 
 
In addition, under relevant provisions of the Plan, the determination of ROE and net-income-growth and the peer group of companies for the relevant performance period may be further adjusted, collectively or individually, to reflect extraordinary events or circumstances affecting the Company or its business, or any of the companies included in the peer group, which render any such goals or peer group selection unsuitable.
 - 
                 
 
These Guidelines do not in any manner restrict the right of the Company to modify performance measures, targets, cycles, or any other term or condition of these Guidelines, as the Company deems it necessary or appropriate, subject to the terms of the Plan.
 - 
                 
 
5.
Termination of Employment
                                     
 
Notwithstanding anything in these Guidelines to the contrary, the following provisions will apply to any Associate whose employment with the Company terminates before the end of the relevant performance period.
 
In the event of a termination of an Associate's employment with the Company before the end of the relevant performance period, either (i) as a result of the Associate's death, Disability or Retirement or (ii) by the Company without Cause, payments with respect to any outstanding Performance Share Rights Award for such performance period will be based on actual Company performance at the end of the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of termination or, if nearer, the end of the fiscal year immediately following the date of termination.  For example, if a performance period covers three fiscal years, and the Associate terminates employment after 16 months in the performance period, payments with respect to any outstanding Award for such performance period will be based on actual Company performance at the end of the first
 - 
                 
 
fiscal year covered by the performance period.  However, if the Associate terminates employment after 20 months in the performance period, payments with respect to any outstanding Award for such performance period will be based on actual Company performance at the end of the second fiscal year covered by the performance period.  Once Company performance is calculated as indicated above, payments are then prorated by multiplying the number of Performance Shares Rights to which the Associate would have been entitled based on such performance by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar months in the performance period of the Associate's actual employment with the Company (including the full calendar month in which the Associate's employment terminated) and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar months in the performance period.
 
In the case of death or Disability, individual performance of the Associate will be ignored.  In the case of Retirement or termination by the Company without Cause, individual performance of the Associate will be taken into account based on the most recently completed individual performance review(s) prior to such termination of employment.  In any of these events, payments under this paragraph shall be made as soon as administratively convenient after termination of employment and after the applicable performance results are calculable.
 - 
                 
 
In the event of termination of an Associate's employment with the Company before the end of the relevant performance period and the actual issuance by the Company of Common Stock pursuant to the Performance Share Rights Award, either (i) by the Company for Cause, or (ii) by the Associate for any reason (other than death, Disability or Retirement), any outstanding Award for such performance period will be immediately forfeited.
 - 
                 
 
6.
Additional Rules
                                     
 
All payments under these Guidelines are considered supplemental pay and will be taxed as such.  Appropriate withholding and deductions will be taken from such payments.  Percentages will be rounded to the nearest 1/10 of a percent (for example, 10.3%).  Amounts will be rounded to the nearest whole dollar.  In accordance with the Plan, the Company may require tax withholding to be satisfied through withholding of shares of Common Stock otherwise payable under the Award.
 - 
                 
up
 
These Guidelines cannot be changed or modified by a verbal communication or course of dealing but only by a written communication signed by the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and/or the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of the Company or any officer designated by one of them.
 - 
                 
 
Payouts earned under these Guidelines are expected to be paid as soon as administratively convenient following the end of the relevant performance period in the form of one (1) share of the Company's Common Stock for each whole Performance Share Right that is payable under the Plan and these Guidelines, rounded up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may permit recipients of
 - 
                 
 
Awards to elect to defer receipt of payment of such Awards under such terms and conditions as the Company may prescribe.
 
In the event of major economic changes, catastrophic events, or any other circumstances not contemplated by the Company (but subject to the Plan provisions relating to Qualified Performance-Based Awards), the Committee, the Chairman, Vice Chairman and/or the CEO of the Company reserves the right to alter, amend, or terminate these Guidelines and any Awards hereunder.
 - 
                 
 
The Chairman of the Company will make all final decisions, rulings and interpretations under these Guidelines (subject to the Plan provisions relating to Qualified Performance-Based Awards, which may require action by the Committee).  By participating in the Plan under these Guidelines, each Associate agrees that such decisions, rulings and interpretations will be final and that each Associate will be bound by them.  Each Associate further agrees that if and when any circumstances arise relating to these Guidelines which are not covered by this description of the Plan, the Associate will be bound by the final decision, ruling or interpretation of the Chairman.
 - 
                 
 
7.
Transition Period
                                     
 
In addition to Performance Share Rights Awards made under these Guidelines for multiple year periods, during the Company's 2006 and 2007 fiscal years, Performance Share Rights Awards will be made to Associates participating in the Plan under these Guidelines for each of the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years based upon the Company's performance in each of such fiscal years as set forth in Section 4 above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 above requiring that an Associate be eligible to participate in the Plan for at least six months of any performance period, an Associate who is hired or is promoted into a position eligible to receive a Performance Share Rights Award under the Plan during the 2006 or 2007 fiscal years before June 1 of such fiscal year will be eligible to receive a prorated Performance Share Rights Award which is otherwise computed in the manner set forth in Section 3 above.

Qualified Performance-Based Awards
                                     
 
Notwithstanding anything in these Guidelines to the contrary, the following provisions will apply to any Associate who is a vice president or above at the time the Awards are established under these Guidelines.  Awards under this Section 8 are intended to satisfy the Section 162(m) Exemption applicable to Qualified Performance-Based Awards under Article 14 of the Plan.  .
Please refer to the Plan document for further information
 
All determinations under these Guidelines will be made by the Committee which, pursuant to Section 4.1 of the Plan, will consist of all the members of the Compensation Committee who are "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
 -

group of companies and potential payout adjustments relating thereto for the relevant performance period.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee will adjust ROE and net-income-growth, the peer group of companies and potential payout adjustments relating thereto for the relevant performance period, collectively or individually, with respect to each Associate covered by this Section 8 to adequately reflect the occurrence, during the performance period, of any of the events described in Sections 14.2 and 14.4 of the Plan.
 - 
                 
 
Payment of any Award under these Guidelines to any Associate covered by this Section 8 is conditioned upon the written certification of the Committee that the performance goals and any other material conditions applicable to such Award were satisfied.
 - 
                 
 
The Committee will retain the discretion to decrease, but not increase, the Award otherwise payable to any Associate covered by this Section 8 in accordance with the applicable performance formula described above.  In no event will the Award otherwise payable to any Associate covered by this Section 8 in accordance with the applicable performance formula described above exceed 1,000,000 shares of Company Stock.
 - 
                 
 
Consistent with Section 1 above, payment of any Award under these Guidelines to any Associate covered by this Section 8 is conditioned upon the Plan having been previously approved by the shareholders of the Company.
