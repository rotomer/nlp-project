Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On March 21, 2006, Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiary, Family Dollar, Inc., entered into the following agreements (collectively, the "Amendments"), each of which provide for the amendment of the definitions to "Consolidated EBITR" and "Leverage Ratio" to exclude certain effects arising from a jury verdict rendered in the Morgan, et. al. v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc. federal Fair Labor Standards Act collective action (the "Morgan Case"): (a) Fourth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 31, 2001, between the Company and Family Dollar, Inc., as Borrower, and Bank of America, N.A. (the "Bank of America Agreement"), as amended by an Amendment dated as of May 29, 2003, a Second Amendment dated as of May 27, 2004, and a Third Amendment dated as of May 16, 2005. (b) Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of August 7, 2001, between the Company and Family Dollar, Inc., as Borrower, and Wachovia Bank, National Association (formerly known as First Union National Bank) (the "Wachovia Agreement"), as amended by a First Amendment dated as of May 29, 2003, a Second Amendment dated as of May 27, 2004, and a Third Amendment dated as of May 16, 2005. The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the underlying credit agreements or any amendment thereto, and reference is made to the complete text of the Amendments which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10(a) and 10(b) respectively. Reference is also made to the underlying credit agreements, which in the case of the Bank of America Agreement, is available as Exhibit 10 to the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 2, 2001, and in the case of the Wachovia Agreement, is available as Exhibit 10(i) to the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended September 1, 2001. Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On March 23, 2006, the Company issued a news release (the "News Release") which reported earnings for the second quarter ended February 25, 2006, and other matters relating to the Company's plans, operations and financial condition. A copy of the News Release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by reference. It includes certain financial information, including net income, diluted earnings per share (historical and projected), and operating profit margin, not derived in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, a litigation charge associated with an adverse jury verdict rendered in the Morgan Case in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 is excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the information provided in the News Release is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results by excluding non-operational activities that may not necessarily be relevant to understand the Company's current or future performance. In addition, this non-GAAP financial information is among the primary indicators that management uses to evaluate the Company's performance, allocate resources, set certain incentive compensation targets and forecast future periods. -2-
This information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance and prospects for the future and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for measures of the Company's financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP is provided in the table entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Net Income" attached to the News Release. The News Release is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor subject to the liabilities of such section.

Exhibit 99 Family Dollar Announces Second Quarter Earnings and Updates Annual Guidance; GAAP Earnings of $0.35 per Diluted Share, Including $0.18 per Share of Litigation Expense; Non-GAAP Earnings of $0.53 per Diluted Share MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 23, 2006--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), today reported that net income per diluted share, under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 ended February 25, 2006, was $0.35 compared with $0.48 for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 ended February 26, 2005. Net income for the second quarter was $54.5 million compared with net income of $80.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Included in results for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 is a litigation charge of $45.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, associated with an adverse litigation judgment in a case in Tuscaloosa, Alabama announced on March 3, 2006. The Company intends to appeal the verdict. Excluding this litigation charge, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.53. "The initiatives that we launched last year are now providing a solid foundation supporting comparable store sales growth. This, along with better than planned gross margin and expense control drove above plan operating results for the second quarter, excluding the legal charge," said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "My thanks to all of our Associates for their continued efforts to make Family Dollar a more compelling place to shop, work, and invest." As previously reported, sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were approximately $1.736 billion, or 9.4% above sales of approximately $1.587 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Sales in comparable stores increased approximately 3.2%. The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, decreased approximately 1.0%, and the average transaction increased approximately 4.2% to $10.28. The Company believes that customers continue to consolidate shopping trips in response to higher energy costs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company opened 87 new stores and closed 37 stores. For the full year, the Company plans to open approximately 400 stores and close approximately 65 stores. The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 32.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to 32.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales, markdown expense, transportation expense, merchandise mix, and shrink expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were all relatively unchanged compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 25.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 from 24.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The increase, as a percentage of sales, was a result of higher utility costs, depreciation expense, and compensation expense related to stock-based compensation. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (SFAS 123R) for its stock-based compensation plans. Under SFAS 123R, all stock-based compensation cost is recognized as an expense in the income statement. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company recorded net interest expense of approximately $0.8 million compared with net interest income of $1.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company had no outstanding debt in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. On October 4, 2005, the Company executed an overnight share repurchase transaction with a bank for the acquisition of ten million shares, or approximately 6%, of the Company's outstanding common stock. The transaction was settled on March 6, 2006, for a total cost of $23.42 per share. As of March 6, 2006, the Company had approximately 6.4 million shares remaining under current repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors. The Company plans to continue common stock purchases utilizing a 10b5-1 program. The Company's inventories at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were $1,016.5 million, or 6.6% above inventories of $954.0 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005. While inventory on a per store basis at the end of the second quarter fiscal 2006 was flat compared with the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005, softline inventory on a per store basis was approximately 7% lower. In the first half of fiscal 2006, capital expenditures were $97.8 million compared with $94.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2005. For the full year, the Company expects total capital expenditures to be between $210 million and $230 million. For the first half of fiscal 2006, depreciation and amortization was $65.0 million compared with $53.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2005. Outlook The Company's cooler program, Urban Initiative and Treasure Hunt merchandise strategy are expected to drive mid-single digit comparable sales growth in the second half of fiscal 2006. Much of this sales growth is expected to be in lower margin merchandise. Accordingly, the Company expects gross margin to decline over the next several quarters. However, the Company expects expense performance to improve as a percent of sales, with expense leverage expected in the fourth quarter. Based on the results year-to-date through the second quarter and the Company's expectations for the second half, the Company now expects diluted earnings per share to be between $1.19 and $1.24, including the litigation charge recorded in the second quarter. Excluding the litigation charge, the Company expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.37 and $1.42. The Company's diluted earnings per share expectation includes the impact of the expensing of stock options as required by SFAS 123R and other new compensation programs, and includes the accretive benefit of the Company's share repurchase program. For the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company expects comparable store sales to increase 4% to 6% and expects diluted earnings per share to be between $0.33 and $0.36, reflecting higher sales of lower margin merchandise. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Disclosures This press release and some of the tables accompanying this release include certain financial information, including net income, diluted earnings per share (historical and projected), and operating profit margin, not derived in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, the litigation charge associated with an adverse jury verdict rendered against the Company in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 is excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures discussed. The Company believes that this information is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results. In addition, this non-GAAP financial information is among the primary indicators the Company uses as a basis for evaluating Company performance, allocating resources, setting certain incentive compensation targets and forecasting of future periods.
