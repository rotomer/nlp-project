Exhibit 99 Family Dollar Announces Third Quarter EPS of $0.37 and Raises Fiscal 2006 Annual Guidance MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 22, 2006--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE:FDO), today reported that net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 ended May 27, 2006, increased 15.6% to $0.37 compared with $0.32 for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 ended May 28, 2005. Net income for the third quarter increased 5.8% to $56.9 million compared with net income of $53.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2005. "We are pleased to report a 16% increase in earnings per share this quarter, especially in light of a challenging macro-economic environment. These strong results reflect the continued hard work of all our Associates to make Family Dollar a more compelling place to shop, work and invest," said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We have made significant progress this year, but we still have a lot of work to do. Continued execution of our key initiatives will enable us to better meet the needs of our customers and drive stronger returns to our shareholders." As previously reported, sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were approximately $1.570 billion, or 9.9% above sales of approximately $1.428 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Sales in comparable stores increased approximately 3.7%. The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, decreased approximately 1.2%, and the average transaction increased approximately 4.8% to $9.54. The Company believes that customers continue to consolidate shopping trips in response to higher energy costs. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company opened 82 new stores and closed 11 stores. The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 33.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, unchanged compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales, lower shrinkage expense offset higher markdown expense and higher freight costs resulting from higher fuel costs. While sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise continued to increase at a faster rate than sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise, higher purchase markups across a majority of departments offset the impact of an unfavorable sales mix in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 when compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, unchanged compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales, higher incentive compensation expense was partially offset by improved performance of the Urban Initiative and lower insurance costs. In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company recorded net interest expense of approximately $1.0 million compared with net interest income of $1.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company had no outstanding debt in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares at an average cost of $25.94. As of May 27, 2006, the Company had approximately 2.6 million shares remaining under current repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors. The Company's inventories at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were $1,028.2 million, or 3.8% above inventories of $990.8 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Inventory on a per store basis at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was approximately 3% lower than inventory per store at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2006, capital expenditures were $144.4 million compared with $147.7 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. For the full year, the Company expects total capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $210 million. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2006, depreciation and amortization was $99.0 million compared with $83.2 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. Outlook In the fourth quarter, the Company expects to open approximately 100-120 new stores and close approximately five stores. Currently, comparable stores in the June period are generating sales increases at the low end of the Company's guidance of 4% to 6%. The Company expects mid-single digit comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Much of this sales growth is expected to be in lower margin merchandise. Accordingly, the Company expects merchandise mix to pressure gross margin in the fourth quarter. However, the Company expects to leverage SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, in the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company expects diluted earnings per share to be between $0.19 and $0.22. Based on the results year-to-date through the third quarter and the Company's expectations for the fourth quarter, the Company now expects diluted earnings per share to be between $1.24 and $1.27, including the litigation charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Excluding the litigation charge, the Company expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.41 and $1.44. The Company's diluted earnings per share expectation includes the impact of the expensing of stock options as required by SFAS 123R and other new compensation programs, and includes the accretive benefit of the Company's share repurchase program. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Disclosures This press release and some of the tables accompanying this release include certain financial information, including net income, diluted earnings per share (historical and projected), and operating profit margin, not derived in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, the litigation charge associated with an adverse jury verdict rendered against the Company in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 is excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures discussed. The Company believes that this information is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the Company's comparative year-to-year operating results. In addition, this non-GAAP financial information is among the primary indicators the Company uses as a basis for evaluating Company performance, allocating resources, setting certain incentive compensation targets and forecasting of future periods. This information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance and prospects for the future and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for measures of the Company's financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP is provided in the table entitled "Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Net Income" attached to this release.
