Exhibit 99 Family Dollar Announces Earnings for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2006 and Provides Guidance for Fiscal 2007 MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 28, 2006--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), today reported that net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 ended August 26, 2006, increased 44.4% to $0.26 compared with $0.18 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 ended August 27, 2005. Net income for the fourth quarter increased 32.9% to $38.8 million compared with net income of $29.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. "Two years ago, Family Dollar began aggressively investing in three key initiatives designed to drive sales and profitability: an enhanced food strategy, the Treasure Hunt merchandise program and the Urban Initiative. These investments provided the foundation for this year's improved results. This year, we continued to invest in these strategic initiatives: we expanded our cooler program to approximately 3,800 stores; we improved the cross-functional support of our Treasure Hunt merchandise program, delivering more excitement for our customers and Associates; and we improved the profitability of our Urban Initiative stores. These achievements were a result of the efforts of all our hard-working Associates," said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are pleased with our performance this year, and we continue to believe that we have tremendous opportunity to better meet the needs of our customers and to drive stronger returns for our shareholders." Fourth Quarter Results As previously reported, sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 were approximately $1.578 billion, or 10.3% above sales of approximately $1.430 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Sales of food, apparel and electronics, including pre-paid cellular phones and services, were the primary drivers of the sales increase. Sales in comparable stores increased approximately 4.9%. The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, decreased approximately 0.5%, and the average transaction increased approximately 5.2% to $9.45. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company opened 108 new stores and closed 8 stores. The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 32.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to 31.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales, a more favorable merchandise sales mix, improved merchandise mark-up and a modest improvement in shrinkage expense more than offset higher freight costs resulting from higher fuel costs. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 28.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 compared with 28.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales, lower property tax expense, lower store payroll, and more favorable trends in workers' compensation and healthcare claims more than offset higher incentive compensation expense. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company recorded net interest expense of approximately $1.4 million compared with net interest income of $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company had no outstanding debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Full Year Results As previously reported, sales for fiscal 2006 were approximately $6.395 billion, or 9.8% above sales of approximately $5.825 billion for fiscal 2005. Sales of consumable merchandise and electronics, including pre-paid cellular phones and services, were the primary drivers of the sales increase. Sales in comparable stores increased approximately 3.7%. The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, decreased approximately 1.2%, and the average transaction increased approximately 4.8% to $9.66. During fiscal 2006, the Company opened 350 new stores and closed 75 stores. The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 33.1% in fiscal 2006 compared to 32.9% in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales, a more favorable merchandise sales mix, better merchandise markup and lower shrinkage expense more than offset higher freight costs resulting from higher fuel costs. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.3% in fiscal 2006 compared with 27.1% in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales, higher incentive compensation expense was partially offset by lower store payroll resulting from the stabilization of store operations and the improved performance of Urban Initiative stores. In fiscal 2006, the Company recorded net interest expense of approximately $4.5 million compared with net interest income of $4.0 million in fiscal 2005. The Company had no outstanding debt in fiscal 2005. Net income per diluted share for fiscal 2006 was $1.30 compared with $1.30 for fiscal 2005. Net income in fiscal 2006 was $201.7 million compared with $217.5 million in fiscal 2005. Included in results for fiscal 2006 is a litigation charge of $45.0 million (approximately $0.18 per diluted share) associated with an adverse litigation judgment in a case in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, announced on March 3, 2006. The Company intends to appeal the verdict. Excluding this litigation charge, non-GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2006 were $229.9 million and $1.48, respectively. During fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased approximately 15.4 million shares for a total cost of $367.3 million. As of August 26, 2006, the Company had approximately 6.1 million shares remaining under current repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors. The Company's inventories at the end of fiscal 2006 were $1.038 billion, or 4.9% below inventories of $1.091 billion at the end of fiscal 2005. Inventory on a per store basis at the end of fiscal 2006 was approximately 10% lower than inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, capital expenditures were $192.2 million compared with $229.1 million in fiscal 2005. Depreciation and amortization was $134.6 million in fiscal 2006 compared with $114.7 million in fiscal 2005. Outlook Commenting on the Company's plans for fiscal 2007, Mr. Levine said, "To realize sustainable, profitable growth, we intend to continue to make investments in our key initiatives to make Family Dollar a more compelling place to shop, work and invest. "To better meet our customers' frequent, fill-in food shopping trip needs, we intend to continue to enhance our food strategy. This year we plan to: -- expand our cooler program to an additional 1,000 stores; -- increase our food assortment in approximately 1,300 stores; and -- accept food stamps in approximately 750 stores by the end of the year. "Urban markets continue to represent a significant opportunity to provide under-served customers with value and neighborhood convenience. This year we plan to: -- continue to focus on driving better returns in existing Urban Initiative markets; -- implement a new technological platform that will facilitate better customer service and make our stores easier to manage; and -- begin to test price optimization. "While our customers depend on us to meet their basic needs, they also appreciate the unexpected surprises our discretionary assortment can provide. In support of our Treasure Hunt merchandising initiative, this year we intend to: -- further develop an event-driven strategy that creates excitement for our customers and Associates; -- continue our focus on improving inventory flow and turns, resulting in better presentation of new product; and -- enhance our apparel assortment. "In addition, this year, we plan to open approximately 400 stores. We intend to continue to build our site-acquisition capabilities and increase our cross-functional focus on new store performance. We will also continue to test new merchandising assortments and layouts through our Concept Renewal efforts, and we will initiate a multi-year investment designed to strengthen our merchandising and supply chain processes. We expect that these investments will improve our productivity and efficiency and, combined with our new store technology platform, will make our stores easier to shop and operate. "We believe that our business has significant growth potential and that our deliberate, long-term investment strategy will deliver strong shareholder returns as we position Family Dollar to better serve the needs of our growing customer base." For the 53-week fiscal year ending September 1, 2007, the Company expects comparable store sales to increase 2% to 4%. The Company believes that higher transportation expense and the impact of a continued mix shift toward lower-margin consumable merchandise will continue to pressure gross profit margin in fiscal 2007. The Company expects that operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, will be lower in fiscal 2007, as the Company continues to refine operational and administrative processes. Using these assumptions, the Company expects earnings per share to be between $1.57 and $1.69. For the September reporting period, the Company's plan was for comparable store sales to increase 3% to 5%. The Company now expects comparable store sales to increase approximately 2% for the September reporting period. Stores that were impacted by hurricanes last year are below the Company average while stores in unaffected areas are performing as planned. For the first quarter ending November 25, 2006, the Company expects comparable store sales to increase 2% to 4% and expects earnings per share to be between $0.34 and $0.38.
