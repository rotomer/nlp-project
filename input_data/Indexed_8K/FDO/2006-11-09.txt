Exhibit 99 Family Dollar Delays 10-K Filing MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 8, 2006--Family Dollar (NYSE:FDO) announced today that it will be unable to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2006, by the due date of November 9, 2006. The Company previously filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on September 25, 2006, in which the Company advised that the Company is a nominal defendant in a lawsuit filed in Mecklenburg County Superior Court alleging that certain of the Company's stock option grants were "backdated." The Company's Board of Directors has formed a Special Committee, which consists solely of independent directors who are not defendants in that action, to conduct an independent investigation of the Company's stock option practices, evaluate the Lawsuit and take such actions with respect to the Lawsuit and related matters as the Special Committee deems appropriate. Because the work of the Special Committee is not complete, the Company is unable to file its annual report on Form 10-K by the due date. While the review of the Special Committee and its outside, independent counsel and advisors is ongoing, the Company currently believes that the incorrect measurement date was used for accounting purposes with respect to certain stock option grants made to newly hired employees and in connection with the Company's annual grant of stock options in one or more years. The Company is currently unable to determine the materiality of any non-cash charges associated with such incorrect measurement dates and accordingly, has not yet determined the impact on the Company's previously filed financial statements. Certain statements contained herein are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements address the Company's plans, activities or events which the Company expects will or may occur in the future. Various risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the timing and outcome of the review being conducted by the Special Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release. The Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that projected results expressed or implied in such statements will not be realized, except as may be required by law.
