Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On December 19, 2006, Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (the "Company"), and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Family Dollar, Inc. ("FDI"), Family Dollar Services, Inc. ("FDS"), Family Dollar Operations, Inc. ("FDO") and Family Dollar Trucking, Inc. ("FDT", and together with FDS and FDO, the "Subsidiary Guarantors") entered into a certain Consent (the "Consent") with Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent ("Administrative Agent"), and a syndicate of lenders (together with the Administrative Agent, the "Lenders") party to that certain Credit Agreement, dated August 24, 2006, between the Company, FDI, and the Lenders (the "Credit Agreement"). Pursuant to the Consent, the Lenders have agreed to extend the delivery date to March 31, 2007, for (i) the audited financial statements for the Company's fiscal year ended August 26, 2006, (ii) the unaudited financial statements for the Company's fiscal quarter ended November 25, 2006, and (iii) the corresponding compliance certificates, and to waive until March 31, 2007, any Defaults or Events of Default that would otherwise occur under the Credit Agreement by the failure of the Company to deliver such information to the Administrative Agent prior to the required delivery dates set forth in the Credit Agreement. Also on December 19, 2006, the Company and FDI entered into a letter agreement (the "Letter Agreement') with various institutional accredited investors ("Noteholders") party to that certain Note Purchase Agreement dated September 27, 2005, between the Company, FDI and the Noteholders (the "Note Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Noteholders have agreed to extend the delivery date to March 31, 2007, for (i) the audited financial statements for the Company's fiscal year ended August 26, 2006, (ii) the unaudited financial statements for the Company's fiscal quarter ended November 25, 2006, and (iii) the corresponding compliance certificates, and to waive until March 31, 2007, any Defaults or Events of Default that would otherwise occur under the Note Purchase Agreement by the failure of the Company to deliver such information to any Noteholder prior to the required delivery dates set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement. As previously announced, the Company has formed a Special Committee of the Board of Directors to investigate the Company's stock option practices (the "Stock Option Investigation"). Because the Stock Option Investigation is not complete, the Company is unable to complete (i) its audited financial statements (and corresponding compliance certificates under the Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement) for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2006, and (ii) its unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended November 25, 2006 (and corresponding compliance certificates under the Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement). The foregoing do not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Consent or the Letter Agreement, and reference is made to the complete texts of such agreements, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. Reference is also made to the underlying Credit Agreement and Note Purchase Agreement, which in the case of the Credit Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10 to the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 28, 2006, and in the case of the Note Purchase Agreement, was filed as Exhibit 10.24 to the Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 7, 2005. 2
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On December 20, 2006, Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (the "Company") issued a news release (the "News Release") which reported preliminary financial results for the first quarter ended November 25, 2006, and other matters relating to the Company's plans, operations and financial condition. The financial results are preliminary due to the Stock Option Investigation. The financial results reported in the News Release do not take into account any adjustments that may be required upon the Company's completion of such review. A copy of the News Release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by reference. The News Release is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor subject to the liabilities of such section. Item 8.01. Other Events. On December 19, 2006, the Company received notice that it is a nominal defendant in a shareholder derivative action captioned "Dorothy M. Lee, Derivatively on Behalf of Family Dollar Stores, Inc., Plaintiff v. Howard R. Levine, Leon Levine, R. James Kelly, R. David Alexander, Jr., Charles S. Gibson, Jr., C. Martin Sowers, George R.

The Lawsuit asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as various common law causes of action, in connection with the alleged backdating of certain stock option grants.

Exhibit 99 Family Dollar Reports Preliminary First Quarter Financial Results Earnings Per Share Increase 12.5% to $0.36 MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 20, 2006--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), today reported preliminary financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ended November 25, 2006. Net income per diluted share increased 12.5% to $0.36 compared with $0.32 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 ended November 26, 2005. Net income for the first quarter was $54.4 million, or 5.8% above net income of $51.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. These financial results are preliminary due to the previously announced review by the Company of its stock option grant practices. The financial results reported today do not take into account any adjustments that may be required upon completion of the review and, therefore, should be considered preliminary until the Company files its annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 and its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. "As a result of the dedicated efforts of all our hard-working Associates, Family Dollar is providing customers with a better shopping experience," said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "During the last several quarters, we have lowered inventory levels and improved our merchandising presentations. We have also worked to enhance our Associate development and retention efforts, and I am especially pleased with the results in stores, where our store manager retention has increased significantly. The result is a more compelling place to shop, work and invest." Beginning in fiscal 2007, the Company will record sales of prepaid cellular services on a net basis; as a result, only the markup on the sales of these products will be recorded as revenue. This change reduced previously reported revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by approximately $24.3 million but had no impact on operating income. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were approximately $1.60 billion, or 5.9% above sales of approximately $1.51 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Sales in comparable stores, adjusted for prepaid cellular services, increased approximately 0.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of an increase in average customer transaction, which offset a slight decline in customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 34.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to 33.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The improvement in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of the growth in sales of prepaid cellular services, lower markdowns and lower inventory shrinkage. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 28.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from 28.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, resulted from lower than expected comparable store sales performance and expenses associated with the Company's review of its stock option processes. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded net interest expense of approximately $3.9 million compared with net interest expense of $1.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company's inventories at November 25, 2006, were $1.09 billion, or 1.8% below inventories of $1.11 billion at November 26, 2005. Excluding in-transit inventory, inventory per store at November 25, 2006, was approximately 7.8% less than inventory per store at November 26, 2005. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, capital expenditures were $20.7 million compared with $48.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company opened 87 new stores and closed 8 stores. For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, depreciation and amortization was $35.5 million compared with $32.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Outlook The Company expects comparable store sales to modestly improve during the remainder of the 53-week fiscal year ending September 1, 2007. The Company believes that sales growth in lower-margin consumables and low single-digit comparable store sales will pressure its operating margin but expects to largely offset this pressure with better purchase markups, lower inventory shrinkage, lower freight expense and the benefits from a continued refinement of operational and administrative processes. Using these assumptions, the Company continues to expect that earnings per share for fiscal 2007 will be between $1.57 and $1.69. The Company continues to expect that comparable store sales for the December period will increase 0% to 2%. The biggest shopping days of the season have not yet occurred, and results for the full month will be significantly impacted by the next several days. For the 14-week quarter ending March 3, 2007, the Company expects net sales to increase 12% to 14% and expects comparable store sales to increase 1% to 3%. The Company expects earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 to be between $0.58 and $0.64. Review of Stock Option Practices As previously announced, the Company has formed a Special Committee of the Board of Directors to investigate the Company's stock option grant practices. While the review of the Special Committee and its outside, independent counsel and advisors is ongoing, the Company currently believes that the incorrect measurement date was used for accounting purposes with respect to certain stock option grants made to newly hired employees and in connection with the Company's annual grant of stock options in one or more years. The Company is currently unable to determine the amount of any charges associated with such incorrect measurement dates and, accordingly, has not yet determined the impact on the Company's financial statements. Consequently, the Company is not currently providing detailed final GAAP financial information for the first quarter of 2007, and all financial results described in this press release, including the Company's earnings guidance, as well as the previously announced financial results for fiscal 2006, should be considered preliminary, and are subject to change to reflect any necessary corrections or adjustments that are identified as a result of the Special Committee's review. The Company is not currently able to predict the extent or significance of any such changes, and no determination has been made as to whether restatements of prior period financial statements will be required. The Company has voluntarily informed the Securities and Exchange Committee ("SEC") of the Special Committee's review and is providing the SEC with information from that review in connection with the SEC's inquiry into the Company's stock option grant practices. Because the work of the Special Committee is not complete, the Company has been unable to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending August 26, 2006. Given these circumstances, the Company does not expect to be in a position to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended November 25, 2006, in a timely manner. The Company plans to become current in its periodic reports required under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as practicable following the completion of the Special Committee's review. Additionally, the Company will not purchase shares under its stock repurchase program until it completes all required filings. Cautionary Statements Certain statements contained in this press release, including those relating to the Company's stock option review and its potential impact on the Company's financial statements, are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that projected results expressed or implied in such statements will not be realized, except as may be required by law. There can be no assurance that the outcome of the review by the Special Committee of the Company's stock option practices and the related potential accounting impact will not result in changes to these preliminary financial results and adjustments for the fiscal 2007 first quarter or a restatement of the financial results provided by the Company for any historical period.
