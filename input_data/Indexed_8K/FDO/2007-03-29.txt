EXHIBIT 99 Family Dollar Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.60 Company Updates Guidance for Fiscal 2007 MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2007--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE:FDO), today reported net income of $90.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 ended March 3, 2007, a 14-week period, compared with $54.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 ended February 25, 2006, a 13-week period. Net income per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 71.4% to $0.60 compared with $0.35 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 included a litigation charge of $45.0 million, or approximately $0.18 per diluted share. "We continue to focus on improving our profitability and financial returns. Excluding the litigation charge in the second quarter of last fiscal year, diluted earnings per share increased approximately 13%," said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are committed to improving our business and serving our customers better. We are driving improvements in key metrics, including better inventory productivity, higher store manager retention, and lower inventory shrinkage, and we are making strategic investments in our merchandise supply chain to deliver more value and convenience to our customers. All of our dedicated Associates are working hard to make Family Dollar a more compelling place to shop, work and invest." Second Quarter Results As previously reported, sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 were approximately $1.947 billion, or 12.2% above sales of approximately $1.736 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Sales in comparable stores (for the comparable 13-week period in both years) increased approximately 0.4%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of an increase in the average customer transaction amount, which offset a decline in customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 33.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to 32.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Stronger sales of prepaid services, better purchase markups and lower inventory shrinkage offset higher markdown expense, resulting in an improvement in gross profit, as a percentage of sales. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 26.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 from 25.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, resulted from expenses (approximately $12 million during the second quarter for legal, accounting and related expenses) associated with the Company's review of its stock option processes and relatively flat comparable store sales performance. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded net interest expense of approximately $1.2 million compared with net interest expense of $0.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company's inventories at March 3, 2007, were $1.001 billion, or 1.6% below inventories of $1.017 billion at February 25, 2006. Excluding in-transit inventory, inventory per store at March 3, 2007, was approximately 7% less than inventory per store at February 25, 2006. In the first half of fiscal 2007, capital expenditures were $50.9 million compared with $97.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2006. During the first half of fiscal 2007, the Company opened 170 new stores and closed 24 stores. For the first half of fiscal 2007, depreciation and amortization was $71.3 million compared with $65.0 million in the first half of fiscal 2006. Outlook During fiscal 2007, the Company expects to open approximately 300 stores and close 45 stores. As a result of the ongoing rollout of the Company's food strategy, the impact from "Treasure Hunt" merchandise sales and a continued focus on driving better returns in the Urban Initiative markets, the Company expects comparable store sales to accelerate modestly during the remainder of the 53-week fiscal year ending September 1, 2007. For the full year, the Company expects comparable store sales to increase 1-3%. The Company believes that sales growth in lower-margin consumables and low single-digit comparable store sales will pressure its operating margin but expects to largely offset this pressure with better purchase markups, lower inventory shrinkage, lower freight expense and the benefits from a continued refinement of operational and administrative processes. Using these assumptions, the Company expects that earnings per share for fiscal 2007 will be between $1.63 and $1.69. Reflecting trends month-to-date, the Company now expects that comparable store sales for the March period will increase 3% to 5%. For the third quarter of fiscal 2007 ending June 2, 2007, the Company expects net sales to increase 5% to 7% and expects comparable store sales for the comparable retail reporting period to increase 1% to 3%. The Company expects earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 will be between $0.39 and $0.43. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Disclosures This press release includes certain financial information, including diluted earnings per share, not derived in accordance with GAAP.
