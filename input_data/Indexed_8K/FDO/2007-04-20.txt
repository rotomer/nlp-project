On April 16, 2007, Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (the "Company") filed a report on Form 8-K regarding the election of Kenneth T. Smith to the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.  At the time of that filing, the information called for in Item 5.02(c)(3) had not been determined.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company considered compensation related to Mr. Smith's promotion at a meeting held on April 17, 2007.  As a result of such determination the Company is amending the Form 8-K filed on April 16, 2007, to provide such compensation information in accordance with Instruction 2 to Item 5.02.
As a result of his promotion, Mr. Smith's annual salary will be $250,000 per year.  His target bonus percentage will be 40% of his annual base salary.  Additionally, Mr. Smith will receive (i) 3,793 stock options; (ii) 1,154 performance share rights awards ("PSRs") for the fiscal years 2007-2009 performance period; (iii) 545 PSRs for the fiscal years 2006-2008 performance period; and (iv) 161 PSRs for the fiscal 2007 performance period.   These stock option and PSR awards are in recognition of his promotion and are in addition to equity grants previously made to Mr. Smith in his prior position with the Company.
The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the compensation provided to Mr. Smith in connection with his promotion to Chief Financial Officer.  Reference is made to the following Company plans:  (i) Family Dollar Stores, Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan (filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 25, 2006); (ii) Family Dollar Stores, Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan (filed as Exhibit 10.3 to the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 25, 2006); (iii) Family Dollar Stores, Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan (filed as Exhibit 10.4 to the Company's Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 12, 2007); and (iv) the Cash Bonus Award Guidelines (filed as Exhibit 10 to the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 6, 2006).
