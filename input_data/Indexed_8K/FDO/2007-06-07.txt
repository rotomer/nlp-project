EXHIBIT 99 Family Dollar Reports May Sales MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 7, 2007--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that net sales for the four weeks ended June 2, 2007, increased 5.9% to approximately $522.0 million from $492.9 million for the comparable four-week period ended June 3, 2006. Sales increases for the four-week period were stronger in food and apparel; sales of home products were softer. Comparable store sales for the four-week period increased 2.5% when compared with sales for the similar four-week period last year. The Company had 6,368 stores as of June 2, 2007, including 19 new stores opened in the fiscal May period. Sales Comparable Store (NRF Calendar) (millions) Total Sales Change Sales Change - ------------------- -------------- ------------------ ---------------- May 2007 $522.0 5.9% 2.5% Third Quarter $1,654.8 5.0% 1.5% Year-to-Date $5,202.4 5.1% 0.9% Fiscal Sales Results The National Retail Federation ("NRF") monthly sales reporting calendar followed by the Company and widely used in the retail industry included a non-comparable fifth week in the January period this year. Consequently, the sum of the months reported in monthly sales releases will differ from the Company's reported sales for its fiscal 2006 quarterly periods. Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 ended June 2, 2007, were approximately $1,654.8 million, or 5.4% above sales of approximately $1,569.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 ended May 27, 2006. For the three quarters ended June 2, 2007 (a 40-week period), sales were approximately $5,202.4 million, or 8.0% above sales of approximately $4,816.7 million for the three quarters ended May 27, 2006 (a 39-week period). Outlook The Company expects that comparable store sales in the five-week period ending July 7, 2007, will increase 1-3% compared with the similar period in the prior year.
