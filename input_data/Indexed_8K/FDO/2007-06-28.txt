Exhibit 99.1 Family Dollar Reports Third Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.40 Company Updates Guidance for Fiscal 2007 MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 28, 2007--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), today reported net income of $60.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 ended June 2, 2007, compared with $56.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 ended May 27, 2006. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 includes $5.7 million, or approximately $0.02 per diluted share, of expense related to the defense and settlement of the Company's shareholder derivative litigation. Net income per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 8.1% to $0.40 compared with $0.37 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. "Over the last two years, we have slowed new store growth and accelerated investments in other areas. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of all of our Associates, we have seen improvement in many of our key financial metrics, including earnings per share, return on shareholders' equity and inventory productivity," said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our focused investment agenda has positioned us to be more competitive in today's challenging economic environment. As we continue to invest to improve our operational execution and enhance the shopping experience for our customers, I continue to be excited about the opportunity for Family Dollar." Third Quarter Results As previously reported, sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were approximately $1.655 billion, or 5.4% above sales of approximately $1.570 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Sales in comparable stores (for the comparable 13-week period in both years) increased approximately 1.5%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of an increase in the average customer transaction amount, which offset a slight decline in customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 34.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to 33.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The improvement in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of increased sales of prepaid services, stronger sales of higher margin merchandise, and better purchase markups. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 29.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 from 27.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of lower than planned comparable store sales performance, expenses related to the defense and settlement of the Company's outstanding stockholder derivative actions, and expenses related to various Company initiatives. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company recorded net interest income of approximately $0.06 million compared with net interest expense of $1.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company's tax rate was approximately 35.0% compared with 37.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily the result of the positive impact of a retroactive reinstatement of federal jobs tax credits, an increase in tax-exempt interest income and the effect of changes in reserves for state income tax contingencies. The Company's inventories at June 2, 2007, were $1.008 billion, or 1.9% below inventories of $1.028 billion at May 27, 2006. Excluding in-transit inventory, inventory per store at June 2, 2007, was approximately 9% less than inventory per store at May 27, 2006. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2007, capital expenditures were $85.9 million compared with $144.4 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2006. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2007, the Company opened 232 new stores and closed 37 stores. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2007, depreciation and amortization was $107.6 million compared with $99.0 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2006. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares at an average cost of $32.53. On June 19, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase an additional five million shares of the Company's common stock. As of June 19, 2007, the Company had approximately 6.0 million shares authorized to be purchased under all authorizations. Outlook Reflecting trends month-to-date, the Company continues to expect that comparable store sales for the June period will increase 1% to 3%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 ending September 1, 2007, the Company expects net sales to increase 5% to 7% and expects comparable store sales for the comparable retail reporting period to increase 1% to 3%. The Company expects that operating margin in the fourth quarter will be pressured by higher markdowns and the effect of low-single digit comparable store sales, but expects to offset this pressure with increased sales of prepaid services, better purchase markups, lower freight expense and lower shrinkage expense. The Company expects earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 will be between $0.26 and $0.29. During fiscal 2007, the Company continues to expect to open approximately 300 stores and close 45 stores. Based on reported results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2007 and the Company's expectations for the fourth quarter, the Company now expects comparable store sales will increase 1% to 2% for the full year and expects that earnings per share for fiscal 2007 will be between $1.62 and $1.65.
