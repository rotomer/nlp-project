EXHIBIT 99 Family Dollar Reports August Sales and Updates Fiscal 2007 Guidance MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 6, 2007--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that net sales for the four weeks ended September 1, 2007, increased 3.4% to approximately $494.4 million from $478.3 million for the comparable four-week period ended September 2, 2006. Total sales increases for the four-week period were strongest in food and seasonal categories, primarily toys and lawn and garden, while sales of apparel were softer. Comparable store sales for the four-week period increased 1.0% when compared with sales for the similar four-week period last year. The Company had 6,430 stores as of September 1, 2007, including 21 new stores opened in the fiscal August period. Sales Total Sales Comparable Store Sales (NRF Calendar) (millions) Change Change - ------------------ ---------- ----------- ---------------------- August 2007 $494.4 3.4% 1.0% Fourth Quarter $1,631.9 3.8% 1.0% Fiscal 2007 $6,834.3 4.8% 0.9% Fiscal Sales Results The National Retail Federation ("NRF") monthly sales reporting calendar followed by the Company and widely used in the retail industry included a non-comparable fifth week in the January period this year. Consequently, the sum of the months reported in monthly sales releases will differ from the Company's reported sales for its fiscal 2006 quarterly periods. Sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 ended September 1, 2007, were approximately $1,631.9 million, or 3.4% above sales of approximately $1,578.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 ended August 26, 2006. For the year ended September 1, 2007, sales were approximately $6,834.3 million, or 6.9% above sales of approximately $6,394.8 million for the year ended August 26, 2006. Outlook As previously disclosed, the Company has installed a new lease management system to create a searchable, electronic repository for the Company's extensive library of store leases. In conjunction with this installation, the Company currently continues to review balances related to store lease accounts. At this time, the Company estimates that the effect of any non-cash, non-recurring adjustments resulting from this review will not significantly impact fourth quarter earnings. Reflecting our current estimate of the impact of this ongoing review and better than expected expense trends, the Company now expects that earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter will be between $0.24 and $0.27 compared with $0.21 per diluted share for the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, the Company currently expects net income per diluted share to be between $1.60 and $1.63 compared with $1.26 per diluted share for the prior fiscal year. The Company expects that comparable store sales for the September period ending October 6, 2007, will increase 1% to 3%.
