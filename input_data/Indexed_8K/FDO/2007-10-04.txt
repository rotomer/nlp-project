EXHIBIT 99 Family Dollar Announces Earnings for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2007 Company Provides Guidance for Fiscal 2008 MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 4, 2007--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), today reported that net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 ended September 1, 2007, increased 23.8% to $0.26 compared with $0.21 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 ended August 26, 2006. Net income for the fourth quarter increased 17.0% to $37.8 million compared with net income of $32.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Included in results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 is a $10.5 million pre-tax, cumulative charge to adjust non-cash stock-based compensation expense. "Despite a challenging economic environment, our team has delivered a solid performance this year. The commitment and hard-work of all our dedicated Associates has resulted in improvements in many of our key financial metrics, including earnings per share, return on shareholders' equity, inventory productivity and Associate retention," said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Volatile energy costs and other inflationary pressures have impacted the spending capacity of low and low-middle income consumers. In the face of these challenges, we continue to manage our business with a longer-term perspective, making significant investments in our business. In fiscal 2007, we expanded our cooler program to 5,100 stores, enhanced the food assortment in our stores, and expanded the selling space for food in 2,700 stores. We also continued to improve our Treasure Hunt strategy through the refinement of our seasonal, apparel and home assortments and through the strengthening of our promotional, advertising and markdown strategies. Finally, we opened 300 new stores and continued to invest in our urban operations with the installation of new store technology in approximately 750 urban stores," continued Mr. Levine. "As our team stays focused on both managing our business with a longer-term perspective while balancing near-term goals, I believe that we can provide investors with strong returns." Fourth Quarter Results As previously reported, sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were approximately $1.632 billion, or 3.4% above sales of approximately $1.578 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Sales of food and certain seasonal categories, primarily toys, were the primary drivers of the sales increase. Sales in comparable stores increased approximately 1.0%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of an increase in the average customer transaction amount. Customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions, was approximately flat during the quarter. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company opened 68 new stores and closed 6 stores. The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 33.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to 32.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. As a percentage of sales, improved merchandise mark-up, a more favorable merchandise sales mix and lower inventory shrinkage more than offset higher seasonal markdowns. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 29.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared with 29.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of low comparable store sales performance, non-recurring adjustments to store lease accounts resulting from the implementation of a new store lease management system, increased store maintenance expense and higher professional fees related to various Company initiatives. The effect of these factors more than offset lower stock-based compensation expense and favorable trends in workers' compensation and healthcare claims. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company's tax rate was approximately 36.7% compared with 37.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily the result of the positive impact of a retroactive reinstatement of federal jobs tax credits, an increase in tax-exempt interest income and the effect of changes in reserves for state income tax contingencies. Full Year Results As previously reported, sales for fiscal 2007 were approximately $6.834 billion, or 6.9% above sales of approximately $6.395 billion for fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 included 53 weeks, compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2006. Sales in comparable stores increased approximately 0.9%. The customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, decreased slightly, and the average customer transaction increased approximately 1% to $9.69. During fiscal 2007, the Company opened 300 new stores and closed 43 stores. The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 34.0% in fiscal 2007 compared to 33.1% in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of sales, a more favorable merchandise sales mix, better merchandise markup and lower inventory shrinkage more than offset higher markdowns. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 28.3% in fiscal 2007 compared with 27.5% in fiscal 2006. The increase in SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of low comparable store sales performance, expenses related to the defense and settlement of the Company's stockholder derivative actions (approximately $22 million), and higher store maintenance and utility expenses. The effect of these factors more than offset favorable trends in workers' compensation and healthcare claims. The Company's tax rate was approximately 36.4% in fiscal 2007 compared with 37.3% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily the result of the positive impact of a retroactive reinstatement of federal jobs tax credits, an increase in tax-exempt interest income and the effect of changes in reserves for state income tax contingencies. Net income per diluted share for fiscal 2007 was $1.62 compared with $1.26 for fiscal 2006. Net income in fiscal 2007 was $242.9 million compared with $195.1 million in fiscal 2006. Included in results for fiscal 2006 is a litigation charge of $45.0 million (approximately $0.18 per diluted share) associated with an adverse litigation judgment, and a $10.5 million (approximately $0.04 per diluted share) cumulative charge as a result of new measurement date determinations for certain historical stock option grants. During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares for a total cost of $257.5 million. Since September 1, 2007, the Company has completed the current repurchase authorization, purchasing 2.9 million shares for a total cost of $80.7 million. The Company's inventories at the end of fiscal 2007 were $1.066 billion, or 2.7% above inventories of $1.038 billion at the end of fiscal 2006. Inventory on a per store basis at the end of fiscal 2007 was approximately 1% lower than inventory per store at the end of fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, depreciation and amortization was $144.1 million compared with $134.6 million in fiscal 2006. Capital expenditures decreased to $131.6 million from $192.2 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in capital expenditures was due primarily to the decrease in the number of new stores opened during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and lower distribution and transportation expenditures. Offsetting some of the decrease were increases in various expenditures related to technology investments. Outlook Commenting on the Company's plans for fiscal 2008, Mr. Levine said, "In fiscal 2008, we will stay focused on our key initiatives to drive revenues, improve profitability and increase shareholder returns. "To capture more of our customers' frequent, fill-in food shopping trips, we intend to expand the selling space for food in approximately 2,800 stores and install refrigerated coolers in approximately 575 stores. In addition, we plan to install our Store of the Future technology platform in approximately 1,500 stores. This new platform will enable us to process customers faster and facilitate the acceptance of a variety of payment types, including food stamps. In addition, the new platform will provide store managers with on-line tools to help them better manage their business. "We plan to continue to develop and refine our Treasure Hunt strategy. For example, in the home and apparel categories, we will continue to focus on providing the customer with a better assortment of quality family apparel and home decor at great values. We also expect to build on our brand management efforts, and we intend to strengthen our global sourcing processes with a focus on improving merchandise quality while reducing costs. "We expect to open approximately 300 new stores in fiscal 2008. This measured pace will enable us to continue to improve the performance of new stores while also improving the returns in our existing 6,430 stores. We believe that investments in our merchandising and supply chain, facility management and indirect procurement processes will provide us with the foundation for targeted improvements in store level returns." Mr. Levine concluded by saying, "The continued investment in our business in fiscal 2008 even as the economic environment remains challenging, reflects our longer-term perspective and will make Family Dollar a more compelling place to shop, work and invest." For the 52-week fiscal year ending August 30, 2008, the Company expects total sales to increase 4% to 6% compared with the 53-week fiscal year ended September 1, 2007. The Company expects comparable store sales to increase 1% to 3% and expects operating income to improve as a percentage of sales driven by better gross margin performance. Reflecting these expectations, the Company expects earnings per share to be between $1.74 and $1.85 in fiscal 2008. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 are expected to be between $180 and $190 million and will include investments in support of the Company's key initiatives, new store openings and the commencement of construction of the Company's tenth distribution center. Due to a calendar shift, the first quarter of fiscal 2008 ending December 1, 2007, will benefit from an extra week of holiday sales. Consequently, the second quarter of fiscal 2008 ending March 1, 2008, will be impacted by both the loss of one week of holiday sales and one less week of sales as compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2007. For the first quarter, the Company expects total sales to increase 7% to 9% and comparable store sales to increase 0% to 2%. Given results month-to-date, the Company expects comparable store sales will increase 0% to 1% for the September reporting period. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company expects earnings per share to be between $0.43 and $0.47.
