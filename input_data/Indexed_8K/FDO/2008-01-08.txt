Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Announces First Quarter Earnings
Updates Fiscal 2008 Guidance
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), today reported that net income per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 ended December 1, 2007, increased 2.8% to $0.37 compared with $0.36 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ended November 25, 2006. Net income for the quarter decreased 4.1% to $51.9 million compared with net income of $54.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
For almost 50 years, Family Dollar has provided customers with value and convenience. We know that in challenging economic times our customers rely on us even more to help them manage their increasingly constrained budgets, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. While categories meeting every day consumable needs continued to perform well, our customers were more restrained with their discretionary spending this quarter. Given the current economic environment, we do not expect this trend to improve in the near term. To better reflect our customers needs in this environment, we are strengthening our assortments in key consumable categories, we are shifting our emphasis within discretionary categories, and we are reassessing our cost structure. As a result, we expect our financial performance to improve in the second half of fiscal 2008.
As previously reported, sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 were approximately $1,683.0million, or 5.2% above sales of approximately $1,600.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The first quarter of fiscal 2008 ended December 1, 2007, included one additional week of post-Thanksgiving sales compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ended November 25, 2006. Sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 were strongest in the Consumables category, driven primarily by sales of food, and the Seasonal and Electronics category, which benefited from the additional week of post-Thanksgiving sales compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Sales of the Apparel and Home Products categories were weaker.
Comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 are reported for the 13-week period ending December 1, 2007, compared with the 13-week period ending December 2, 2006. As previously reported, comparable store sales decreased approximately 1.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The decrease in comparable store sales was a result of a decline in customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions. The average customer transaction increased slightly during the period.
The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 34.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. As a percentage of sales, higher seasonal markdowns and higher inventory shrinkage more than offset improved merchandise mark-up, resulting primarily from strong sales of pre-paid services and an additional week of holiday sales.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 29.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 compared with 28.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of low comparable store sales performance, higher occupancy and other store-related expenses, and increased advertising expenses. The effect of these factors more than offset favorable trends in workers compensation and healthcare claims and lower professional fees.
The Companys inventories at December 1, 2007, were $1.12 billion, or 2.8% above inventories of $1.09 billion at November 25, 2006. Excluding in-transit inventory, inventory per store at December 1, 2007, declined approximately 1% compared with inventory per store at November 25, 2006.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, capital expenditures were $36.6 million compared with $20.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company opened 67 new stores and closed 20 stores.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares for a total cost of $80.7 million. As of December 1, 2007, the Company had authorization to purchase up to $150 million of the Companys common stock.
Outlook
As a result of the implementation of sales-driving initiatives, the Company expects the comparable store sales trend in the second half of fiscal 2008 will improve modestly and will contribute to earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 2008.
For the 52-week fiscal year ending August 30, 2008, the Company expects total sales to increase 2% to 3% compared with the 53-week fiscal year ended September 1, 2007. For the full year, the Company expects that comparable store sales will be flat or increase slightly and expects gross margin will be pressured by a higher sales mix of lower-margin consumables. However, the Company believes that better purchase markups, lower inventory shrinkage, and an aggressive focus on expense control can partially offset these pressures. For the full year, the Company expects that earnings per diluted share will be between $1.56 and $1.64.
Due to a calendar shift, the second quarter of fiscal 2008 ending March 1, 2008, will be impacted by both the loss of one week of holiday sales and one less week of sales as compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The Company believes that these factors will result in a decline in total revenues of approximately 5% to 6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. For the quarter ending March 1, 2008, the Company expects comparable store sales will be flat to down slightly for the comparable thirteen-week reporting period. For the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company expects earnings per diluted share will be between $0.40 and $0.44.
The Company estimates that total sales for the December retail period increased approximately 3% and that comparable store sales decreased approximately 1%. The Company will report final sales results for the December period on Thursday, January 10, 2008.
