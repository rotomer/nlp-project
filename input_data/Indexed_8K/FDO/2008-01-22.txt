Exhibit 10
1.1.          .  The Family Dollar Stores, Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan is designed to promote the success, and enhance the value, of the Company, by linking the personal interests of employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company or any Affiliate (as defined below) to those of Company stockholders and by providing such persons with an incentive for outstanding performance.

Accordingly, the Plan permits the grant of incentive awards from time to time to selected employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company and its Affiliates.

The Option price due upon exercise of any Option shall be payable to the Company in full either: (i) in cash or its equivalent, or (ii) by tendering previously acquired Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Option price (provided that the Shares which are tendered must have been held by the Participant for at least six (6) months prior to their tender to satisfy the Option price unless such Shares had been acquired by the Participant on the open market), or (iii) by a combination of (i) and (ii).

RIGHT TO PAYMENT
 
(1)             The Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise; over
 
(2)             The base value of the Stock Appreciation Right as determined by the Committee, which shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of one Share on the Grant Date (other than an SAR issued as a substitute Award pursuant to Section 15.11 or unless the SAR is granted in tandem with an Option after the Grant Date of the Option, in which case, to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the base price of the SAR may equal the exercise

OTHER TERMS
 
9.1.          .  The Committee is authorized to grant Performance Shares, Performance Units or Performance-Based Cash Awards to Participants on such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee.
GRANT OF PERFORMANCE AWARDS
 
9.2.            The Committee may establish performance goals for Performance Awards which may be based on any criteria selected by the Committee.  Such performance goals may be described in terms of Company-wide objectives or in terms of objectives that relate to the performance of the Participant, an Affiliate or a division, region, department or function within the Company or an Affiliate.  If the Committee determines that a change in the business, operations, corporate structure or capital structure of the Company or the manner in which the Company or an Affiliate conducts its business, or other events or circumstances render performance goals to be unsuitable, the Committee may modify such performance goals in whole or in part, as the Committee deems appropriate.  If a Participant is promoted, demoted or transferred to a different business unit or function during a performance period, the Committee may determine that the performance goals or performance period are no longer appropriate and may (i) adjust, change or eliminate the performance goals or the applicable performance period as it deems appropriate to make such goals and period comparable to the initial goals and period, or (ii) make a cash payment to the participant in an amount determined by the Committee.  The foregoing two sentences shall not apply with respect to a Performance Award that is intended to be a Qualified Performance-Based Award, except to the extent the Committee exercises such negative discretion as is permitted under applicable law for purposes of the Section 162(m) Exemption.
PERFORMANCE GOALS.
 
9.3.          .

9.4.          .  The terms, methods of exercise, methods of settlement, form of consideration payable in settlement, and any other terms and conditions of any Performance Awards shall be determined by the Committee.  For purposes of determining the number of Shares to be used in payment of a Performance Award denominated in cash but payable in whole or in part in Shares or Restricted Stock, the number of Shares to be so paid will be determined by dividing the cash value of the Award to be so paid by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of determination by the Committee of the amount of the payment under the Award, or, if the Committee so directs, the date immediately preceding the date the Award is paid.

The Committee may provide that Dividend Equivalents be paid or distributed when accrued or be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares or units equivalent to Shares, or otherwise reinvested.
GRANT OF DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS
 
12.2         .  The Committee is authorized to grant Interest Equivalents to Participants subject to such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee.

When granting an Award other than an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right, the Committee may designate such Award as a Qualified Performance-Based Award, based upon a determination that the recipient is or may be a Covered Employee with respect to such Award, and the Committee wishes such Award to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption.  If an Award is so designated, the Committee shall establish performance goals for such Award within the time period prescribed by Section 162(m) of the Code based on one or more of the following Qualified Business Criteria, which may be expressed in terms of Company-wide objectives or in terms of objectives that relate to the performance of an Affiliate or a division, region, department, function or combination thereof within the Company or an Affiliate:

Any member of a specially-created performance index that undergoes a corporate event or transaction of a kind described in Article 16 or that files a petition for bankruptcy during a measurement period shall be disregarded from and after such event, unless the Committee determines not to disregard such entity or to make some other adjustment to measuring the performance index and the effect of such Committee determination is to reduce the amount payable under any affected Qualified Performance-Based Award.  Performance goals need not be based upon an increase or positive result under a business criterion and could include, for example, the maintenance of the status quo or the limitation of economic losses (measured, in each case, by reference to a specific business criterion).

Performance periods established by the Committee for any such Qualified Performance-Based Award may be as short as three months and may be any longer period.  In addition, the Committee may reserve the right, in connection with the grant of a Qualified Performance-Based Award, to exercise negative discretion to determine that the portion of such Award actually earned, vested and/or payable (as applicable) shall be less than the portion that would be earned, vested and/or payable based solely upon application of the applicable performance goals.

Except as specifically provided in Section 14.3, no Qualified Performance-Based Award held by a Covered Employee or by an employee who in the reasonable judgment of the Committee may be a Covered Employee on the date of payment, may be amended, nor may the Committee exercise any discretionary authority it may otherwise have under the Plan with respect to a Qualified Performance-Based Award under the Plan, in any manner to waive the achievement of the applicable performance goal based on Qualified Business Criteria or to increase the amount payable pursuant thereto or the value thereof, or otherwise in a manner that would cause the Qualified Performance-Based Award to cease to qualify for the Section 162(m) Exemption.
CERTIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE GOALS
15.1.        .  Awards granted under the Plan may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition to, in tandem with, any other Award granted under the Plan.  Subject to Section 17.2, Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards may be granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the grant of such other Awards.

No unexercised or restricted Award shall be assignable or transferable by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that the Committee may (but need not) permit other transfers where the Committee concludes that such transferability (i) does not result in accelerated taxation, (ii) does not cause any Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option to fail to be described in Code Section 422(b), and (iii) is otherwise appropriate and desirable, taking into account any factors deemed relevant, including without limitation, state or federal tax or securities laws applicable to transferable Awards.  Any purported transfer in violation of this Section 15.4 shall be null and void.
LIMITS ON TRANSFER
 
15.5.        .  Notwithstanding Section 15.4, a Participant may, in the manner determined by the Committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Participant and to receive any distribution with respect to any Award upon the Participant's death.  A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative, or other person claiming any rights under the Plan is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award Certificate applicable to the Participant, except to the extent the Plan and Award Certificate otherwise provide, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.  If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Participant, payment shall be made to the Participant's surviving spouse or, in the

Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Stock (stock-split), a declaration of a dividend payable in Shares, or a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Stock into a lesser number of Shares, the authorization limits under Section 5.1 and 5.4 shall automatically be adjusted proportionately, and the Shares then subject to each Award shall automatically be adjusted proportionately without any change in the aggregate purchase price therefore.
  To the extent that any adjustments made pursuant to this Article 16 cause Incentive Stock Options to cease to qualify as Incentive Stock Options, such Options shall be deemed to be Nonstatutory Stock Options.
 
17.1.        .
AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION
 
(a)           The Board or the Committee may, at any time and from time to time, amend, modify or terminate the Plan without stockholder approval; laws or the applicable listing or other requirements of an Exchange, , that the Board or Committee may condition any amendment or modification on the approval of stockholders of the Company for any reason, including by reason of such approval being necessary or deemed advisable to (i) to comply with the listing or other requirements of an Exchange, or (ii) to satisfy any other tax, securities or other applicable laws, policies or regulations.
provided, however, that if an amendment to the Plan would, in the reasonable opinion of the Board or the Committee, either (i) materially increase the number of Shares available under the Plan, (ii) expand the types of awards under the Plan, (iii) materially expand the class of participants eligible to participate in the Plan, (iv) materially extend the term of the Plan, or (v) otherwise constitute a material change requiring stockholder approval under applicable
then such amendment shall be subject to stockholder approval; and provided, further
 
(b)           No termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the Participant affected thereby.  An outstanding Award shall not be deemed to be "adversely affected" by a Plan amendment if such amendment would not reduce or diminish the value of such Award determined as if the Award had been exercised, vested, cashed in or otherwise settled on the date of such amendment (with the per-share value of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right for this purpose being calculated as the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value as of the date of such amendment over the exercise price or base value of such Award).
 
(c)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to
amend the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan, by action of the Board or the Committee, without the consent of any affected Participant, to the extent deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of maintaining compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
17.2.        .  At any time and from time to time, the Committee may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award without approval of the Participant; provided, however:
AWARDS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED
 
(a)           Subject to the terms of the applicable Award Certificate, such amendment, modification or termination shall not, without the Participant's consent, reduce or diminish the value of such Award determined as if the Award had been exercised, vested, cashed in or otherwise settled on the date of such amendment or termination (with the per-share value of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right for this purpose being calculated as the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value as of the date of such amendment or termination over the exercise or base price of such Award);
 
(b)           The original term of an Option may not be extended without the prior approval of the stockholders of the Company; and
 
(c)           Except as otherwise provided in Article 16, the exercise price of an Option may not be reduced, directly or indirectly, without the prior approval of the stockholders of the Company.
 
18.1.        .  No Participant or any Eligible Individual shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan.  Neither the Company, its Affiliates nor the Committee is obligated to treat Participants or Eligible Individuals uniformly, and determinations made under the Plan may be made by the Committee selectively among Eligible Individuals who receive, or are eligible to receive, Awards (whether or not such Eligible Individuals are similarly situated).
NO RIGHTS TO AWARDS; NON-UNIFORM DETERMINATIONS
 
18.2.        .  No Award gives a Participant any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company unless and until Shares are in fact issued to such Participant in connection with the Award.
NO STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS
 
18.3.        .  The Company or any Affiliate shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any exercise, lapse of restriction or other taxable event arising as a result of the Plan or an Award.  If to satisfy tax obligations in excess of the
WITHHOLDING
Shares are permitted to be surrendered to the Company
minimum tax withholding obligation, such Shares must have been held by the Participant as fully vested shares for such period of time, if any, as necessary to avoid the recognition of an expense under generally accepted accounting principles.  The Company shall have the authority to require a Participant to remit cash to the Company in lieu of the surrender of Shares for tax withholding obligations if the surrender of Shares in satisfaction of such withholding obligations would result in the Company's recognition of expense under generally accepted accounting principles.  With respect to withholding required upon any taxable event under the Plan, the Committee may, at the time the Award is granted or thereafter, require or permit that any such withholding requirement be satisfied, in whole or in part, by withholding from the Award Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding equal to the minimum amount (and not any greater amount) required to be withheld for tax purposes.
 
18.4.        .  Nothing in the Plan, any Award Certificate or any other document or statement made with respect to the Plan, shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate any Participant's employment or status as an officer, director or consultant at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue as an employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any Affiliate, whether for the duration of a Participant's Award or otherwise.
NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED SERVICE
 
18.5.        .  The Plan is intended to be an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation.  With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Certificate shall give the Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.  This Plan is not intended to be subject to ERISA.
UNFUNDED STATUS OF AWARDS
 
18.6.        .  No payment under the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate unless specifically provided otherwise in such other plan.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BENEFITS
 
18.7.        .  The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only, and in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control.

(b)           Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if at any time the Committee shall determine that the registration, listing or qualification of the Shares covered by an Award upon any Exchange or under any foreign, federal, state or local law or practice, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such Award or the purchase or receipt of Shares thereunder, no Shares may be purchased, delivered or received pursuant to such Award unless and until such registration, listing, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any condition not acceptable to the Committee.  Any Participant receiving or purchasing Shares pursuant to an Award shall make such representations and agreements and furnish such information as the Committee may request to assure compliance with the foregoing or any other applicable legal requirements.  The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate or certificates for Shares under the Plan prior to the Committee's determination that all related requirements have been fulfilled.  The Company shall in no event be obligated to register any securities pursuant to the 1933 Act or applicable state or foreign law or to take any other action in order to cause the issuance and delivery of such certificates to comply with any such law, regulation or requirement.
