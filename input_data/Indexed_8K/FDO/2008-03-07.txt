Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Reports February Sales
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that net sales for the four weeks ended March 1, 2008, increased 4.4% to $533.7 million compared with $511.4 million for the comparable four-week period ended March 3, 2007. Total sales for the four-week period were strongest in the seasonal and electronics category and in the consumables category. Comparable store sales increased 1.3% as compared with sales in the comparable four-week period last year. The Company had 6,509 stores as of March 1, 2008, including 17 new stores opened in the February period.
March Sales Outlook
This year, Easter will occur in the March sales period. Last year, Easter occurred in the April sales period. As the Companys stores are closed on Easter, the Company expects that this calendar shift will negatively impact the March sales period and positively impact the April sales period. For the March sales period ending April 5, 2008, the Company expects that comparable store sales will decrease 2% to 4% from the similar period in the prior fiscal year.
