Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Announces Second Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.45
Updates Fiscal 2008 Guidance
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), today reported net income of $63.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 ended March 1, 2008, a 13-week period, compared with $90.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 ended March 3, 2007, a 14-week period. Net income per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $0.45 compared with $0.60 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
Our customers continue to react to the current economic environment by limiting their discretionary spending. This was particularly apparent in our stores during this past holiday season. In addition, our second quarter performance was pressured by both the loss of one week of holiday sales and one less week of sales as compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Despite these challenges, I am pleased with our expense control and inventory management this quarter, especially within such a volatile economic environment, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
While we continue to expect that our customers will be financially challenged near-term, we believe that the impending government stimulus package will bring some much needed relief later this year. Continued growth in our consumable business, along with our intense focus on controlling expenses and mitigating inventory risk are expected to result in better performance in the second half of fiscal 2008.
Second Quarter Results
As previously reported, net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 were $1.833billion, or 5.9% below sales of $1.947 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. As a reminder, the second quarter of fiscal 2008 included one less week of holiday sales and one less week of sales compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Comparing results for the same 13-week period year over year, net sales increased 3.2%, and sales in comparable stores were approximately flat. An increase in the average customer transaction offset lower customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions.
Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 32.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to 33.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Higher seasonal markdowns contributed to lower gross profit, as a percentage of sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition, lower net sales during the quarter resulted in the de-leverage of many costs, including freight expense and inventory shrinkage.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses declined 1.3% to $502.6 million compared to $509.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 27.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 compared with 26.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of lower net sales during the quarter. In addition, higher store occupancy expenses more than offset lower insurance expense and lower professional fees.
First Half Results
As previously reported, sales for the first half of fiscal 2008 were $3.516billion, or 0.9% below sales of $3.548 billion for the first half of fiscal 2007. As a reminder, the first half of fiscal 2008 included one less week of sales compared with the first half of fiscal 2007. Sales in comparable stores (for the comparable 26-week period in both years) decreased 0.5%. The decrease in comparable store sales during the 26-week period was a result of lower customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions. The average customer transaction increased slightly during the period. During the first half of fiscal 2008, the Company opened 123 new stores and closed 44 stores.
Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 33.4% in the first half of fiscal 2008 compared to 34.0% in the first half of fiscal 2007. Higher seasonal markdowns and higher inventory shrinkage resulted in lower gross profit, as a percentage of sales, in the first half of fiscal 2008.
SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 28.3% in the first half of fiscal 2008 compared with 27.4% in the first half of fiscal 2007. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of low comparable store sales performance and higher occupancy costs. The effect of these factors more than offset lower insurance expense and lower professional fees.
The Companys inventories at March 1, 2008, were $998.3 million, or 0.3% below inventories of $1,001.4 million at March 3, 2007. Excluding in-transit inventory, inventory per store at March 1, 2008, declined approximately 1% compared with inventory per store at March 3, 2007.
At March 1, 2008, the Company had approximately $317.0 million cash and investment securities, including $237.0 million of investments ($240.9 million at par) in tax exempt auction rate securities (ARS) that had or have subsequently experienced failed auctions. Substantially all of the Companys ARS portfolio includes AAA rated bonds that are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the federal government. At this time, the Company has no reason to believe that any of the issuers of the ARS are presently at risk or that the credit quality of the ARS investments has been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments. The Company believes that the current lack of liquidity relating to the ARS investments will have no impact on its ability to fund its ongoing operations and growth initiatives.
During the first half of fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $97.7 million. As of March 1, 2008, the Company had authorization to purchase up to an additional $133.0 million of its common stock.
Outlook
Since the Company provided annual earnings guidance three months ago, economic conditions have continued to deteriorate. Low and lower-middle income customers continue to focus on basic consumables while constraining purchases of more discretionary items.
While the Easter shift creates comparability issues for the March and April periods, the Company expects that comparable store sales will be flat to up slightly in the third quarter. Reflecting trends month-to-date, the Company expects that comparable store sales for the March period will decrease 4% to 5%. Although sales of consumable products continue to be strong, sales of more discretionary categories, especially apparel and lawn and garden, are softer than the March period last year. The Company expects earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 will be between $0.39 and $0.44, compared with $0.40 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2007.
While the federal stimulus package is expected to benefit the Companys target customer, predicting the magnitude of the impact is difficult. The Company expects that earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter will be between $0.29 and $0.34, compared with $0.26 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
Reflecting current assumptions for the third and fourth quarters, the Company now expects that earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2008 will be between $1.50 and $1.60, compared with $1.62 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. For the full year, the Company expects to open approximately 200 new stores and close approximately 75 stores and expects that comparable store sales will be flat or increase slightly.
