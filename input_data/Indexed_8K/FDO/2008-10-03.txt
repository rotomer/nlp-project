Family Dollar Reports Record Fourth Quarter Earnings
Earnings per diluted share increases 46.2% to $0.38
Net income increases 40.7%
Operating profit margin increases 89 basis points
Issues fiscal 2009 Guidance
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), today reported earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2008 and provided fiscal 2009 guidance.
As expected, fourth quarter sales benefited from the effect of the government stimulus checks distributed this summer. Strong sales of consumables and effective management of inventory risk, combined with disciplined expense control resulted in robust earnings growth, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. After a challenging first half, these results reflect how quickly our team has adapted to the changing macro environment. The investments we made to drive revenue growth delivered strong results, and our Associates did a great job managing expenses and inventory risk in this uncertain environment.
Net income per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 increased 46.2% to $0.38 compared with $0.26 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 increased 40.7% to $53.2 million, compared with $37.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
Fourth Quarter Results
As previously reported, net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were $1.766billion, or 8.2% above sales of $1.632 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Sales in comparable stores increased 5.6%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of an increase in the average customer transaction value and higher customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company opened 40 stores and closed 14 stores.
Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 32.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to 33.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The decline in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, during the quarter was a result of the effect of stronger sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise and higher freight expense, which was partially offset by lower merchandise markdowns and lower store inventory shrinkage.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 4.4% to $499.2 million compared to $478.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 compared with 29.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Most expenses were leveraged during the quarter as a result of the strong comparable store sales increase and continued expense management.
Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, was 4.6% compared with 3.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Lower SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, more than offset lower gross profit, as a percentage of sales.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Companys tax rate was approximately 34.8% compared with 36.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily the result of the effect of changes in reserves for income tax contingencies.
Fiscal 2008 results
As previously reported, sales for fiscal 2008 were $6.984billion, or 2.2% above sales of $6.834 billion for fiscal 2007. As a reminder, fiscal 2008 had one less week of sales compared with fiscal 2007. Sales in comparable stores (for the comparable 52-week period in both years) increased 1.2%. The increase in comparable store sales during the 52-week period was the result of an increase in the average customer transaction value. Customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions, was approximately flat for the year. During fiscal 2008, the Company opened 205 new stores and closed 64 stores.
Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 33.6% in fiscal 2008 compared to 34.0% in fiscal 2007. The decline in gross profit in fiscal 2008, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of stronger sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise.
SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 28.4% in fiscal 2008 compared with 28.3% in fiscal 2007. The modest increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of low comparable store sales performance and higher occupancy costs. The effect of these factors more than offset lower insurance expense and lower professional fees.
Net income per diluted share in fiscal 2008 increased 2.5% to $1.66 compared with $1.62 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. Net income for fiscal 2008 was $233.1 million compared to $242.9 million in fiscal 2007.
The Companys inventories at August 30, 2008, were $1.033 billion, or 3.1% below inventories of $1.066 billion at September 1, 2007. Average inventory per store (excluding in-transit inventory) at the end of fiscal 2008 was approximately 6% lower than the average inventory per store at the end of the fiscal 2007.
Cash Flow and Liquidity
During fiscal 2008, the Company generated $515.8 million in operating cash flow compared with $415.8 million in fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures increased to $167.9 million in fiscal 2008 compared with $131.6 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in capital expenditures was a result of investments related to the rollout of the Companys Store of the Future technology initiative and investments in existing distribution centers. During fiscal 2008, the Company paid $67.4 million, or $0.49 per share, in dividends compared to $65.8 million, or $0.45 per share, in fiscal 2007.
Working capital in fiscal 2008 fell to $275.1 million, reflecting the reclassification of $222.1 million of auction rate securities to long-term assets. Due to the continued failure of auctions for these securities and the uncertainty regarding the timing of future liquidity, the investments were reclassified in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. At August 30, 2008, the Company had approximately $158.5 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Outlook
Commenting on the Companys outlook for fiscal 2009, Mr. Levine said, In fiscal 2009 we intend to build on the progress we made in fiscal 2008.
We will continue to increase our relevancy to the customer. In an environment of rising unemployment, strong inflationary pressures and volatile energy prices, value and convenience are more important than ever to our customers, and in fiscal 2009 we will make investments to strengthen our value and convenience proposition while also enhancing the customers shopping experience.
While we will aggressively invest to drive revenues, we also intend to manage risk. With the enhanced capabilities developed through our Project Accelerate initiative, we expect to build on the improvements we made in fiscal 2008 and improve inventory productivity while also managing merchandise markdowns.
Finally, we will aggressively manage our cost structure. Our store operations and merchandising groups are focused on reducing inventory shrinkage, even in a challenging economic environment. Through our global sourcing and private label efforts, we intend to strengthen our processes to provide customers with quality products while lowering our overall sourcing costs. We also expect to continue to leverage our buying power to negotiate lower costs while utilizing technology and outsourcing to lower our operating expenses.
Mr. Levine concluded by saying, While we are not immune to the current economic conditions, our strategy of providing customers with value and convenience positions us well within todays environment. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity of our niche and will continue to invest in building merchandising capabilities and operating efficiencies to drive increased shareholder value.
For the fiscal year ending August 29, 2009, the Company expects net sales to increase 3% to 5% as compared with the fiscal year ended August 30, 2008. The Company expects comparable store sales will increase 1% to 3% and expects to open approximately 200 new stores. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 are expected to be between $140 million and $160 million and will include investments in support of the Companys key technology initiatives, new store openings and store renovations. Anticipating continued strong sales of consumable merchandise and continued management of expense growth, the Company expects earnings per share will be between $1.58 and $1.78 in fiscal 2009.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company expects net sales to increase 4% to 6% and comparable store sales to increase 2% to 4%. The Company anticipates that strong sales of consumables combined with tight expense control will result in earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 of between $0.38 and $0.42 compared with $0.37 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
