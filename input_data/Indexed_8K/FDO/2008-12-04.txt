Exhibit 99
Family Dollar First Quarter Comparable Store Sales Increase 2.1%
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 4, 2008--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that net sales for the first quarter ended November 29, 2008, were approximately $1,753.8 million compared with $1,683.0 million for the first quarter ended December 1, 2007. Comparable store sales for the quarter increased 2.1%. The Company had 6,617 stores as of November 29, 2008, including 65 new stores opened in the first quarter.
Our first quarter started off on a strong note with comparable store sales increasing 3.6% for the first two months of the quarter. While this strength continued into early November, the last two weeks of the reporting period, as expected, were adversely affected by two significant calendar shifts. First, the later Thanksgiving this year resulted in one less week of post-Thanksgiving sales in the reporting period as compared with the November period last year. In addition, the November period ended on November 29, 2008, this year as compared to December 1, 2007, last year, resulting in a shift of the first-of-the month money flow and our corresponding advertising into the December period, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and CEO. While the current economic environment continues to pressure sales in more discretionary categories, total sales of consumable merchandise continue to be strong, increasing approximately 13% during the quarter.
