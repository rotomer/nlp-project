Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Reports First Quarter Earnings and December Sales Results
Earnings Per Diluted Share Increase 13.5% to $0.42
December Comparable Store Sales Increase Approximately 6%
Management Increases Fiscal 2009 Guidance
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 7, 2009--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO), today reported that net income per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 ended November 29, 2008, increased 13.5% to $0.42 compared with $0.37 for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 ended December 1, 2007. Net income for the quarter increased 14.1% to $59.3 million compared with net income of $51.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
As more families face financial challenges in this environment, they are relying on Family Dollar for more of their everyday needs, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, were gaining market share and driving both increased customer traffic and transaction value. These results reflect our continued focus on providing value for our customers while also managing inventory risk and driving overall profitability.
As previously reported, sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were approximately $1.754billion, or 4.2% above sales of approximately $1.683 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Comparable store sales increased 2.1%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of an increase in the average customer transaction value and higher customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions. Sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were strongest in the Consumables category, driven primarily by sales of food.
The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 35.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 34.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The improvement in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was a result of lower seasonal markdowns, lower freight expense, lower inventory shrinkage and higher purchase mark-ups which more than offset stronger sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 29.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared with 29.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of higher insurance expense and higher occupancy costs. Most other expenses were leveraged during the quarter.
The Companys inventories at November 29, 2008, were $1.09 billion, or 2.7% less than inventories of $1.12 billion at December 1, 2007. Excluding in-transit inventory, inventory per store at November 29, 2008, declined approximately 4.5% compared with inventory per store at December 1, 2007.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, capital expenditures were $28.2 million compared with $36.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company opened 65 new stores and closed 19 stores.
Holiday Season Update
Despite the economic pressures, customers clearly appreciated the great values we offered this holiday season, said Levine. For the December reporting period, net sales increased approximately 8% and comparable store sales increased approximately 6%. Although consumables continued to be strong, our selective investments in key discretionary categories, particularly toys, made Christmas this year more affordable for many families. As a result, our inventories in discretionary categories at the end of the critical holiday selling season were well controlled.
Outlook
For the fiscal year ending August 29, 2009, the Company expects net sales will increase 4% to 6% and expects comparable store sales will increase 2% to 4%. Anticipating continued strong sales of consumable merchandise, the Company expects earnings per share will be between $1.63 and $1.81 in fiscal 2009.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2009 ending February 28, 2009, the Company expects comparable store sales will increase 3% to 5%. The Company expects earnings per diluted share will be between $0.48 and $0.52.
