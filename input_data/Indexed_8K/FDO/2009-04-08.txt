Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Reports Second Quarter Earnings
Earnings Per Diluted Share Increase 33.3% To $0.60
Management Increases Fiscal 2009 Guidance
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 8, 2009--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) today reported that net income per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 ended February 28,2009, increased 33.3% to $0.60 per diluted share compared with $0.45 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 ended March 1, 2008. Net income for the second quarter increased 32.9% to $84.1 million compared with net income of $63.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
In todays challenging economic environment, families of all incomes are looking for ways to save money. Our strategy of providing both value and convenience continues to resonate well with consumers, and, as a result, we continue to capture more shopping trips and gain market share, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
While the current environment has resulted in more budget-minded consumers, our strong performance is also the result of significant investments we have made to enhance the Family Dollar shopping experience. Our multi-year focus on building and retaining great employee teams, improving merchandise quality, and enhancing the shopability of our stores has positioned us well to serve our core customers better while also satisfying new customers who may be visiting our stores for the first time, continued Levine. We have made significant progress to improve our relevancy to the customer, and we will continue to invest to make Family Dollar a more compelling place to shop, work and invest.
As previously reported, sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 were approximately $1.992billion, or 8.7% above sales of approximately $1.833 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Comparable store sales increased 6.4%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of increased customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions, and an increase in the value of the average customer transaction. Sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 were strongest in the Consumables category.
The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 33.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 32.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The improvement in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was a result of lower seasonal markdowns, lower inventory shrinkage, lower freight expense, and higher purchase mark-ups which more than offset stronger sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 27.0% in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 compared with 27.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Most expenses, including occupancy and payroll costs, were leveraged during the quarter as a result of a strong comparable store sales increase and continued expense management. These improvements offset higher incentive compensation and higher insurance expense.
The Companys inventories at February 28, 2009, were $1.035 billion, or 3.7% more than inventories of $0.998 billion at March 1, 2008. Inventory per store increased 1.6%. Reflecting increased customer demand, inventory of consumable merchandise was higher, offsetting lower inventory in more discretionary categories.
Outlook
For the fiscal year ending August 29, 2009, the Company expects net sales will increase between 5% and 7% and expects comparable store sales will increase between 3% and 5%. The Company expects earnings per diluted share will be between $1.90 and $2.00 in fiscal 2009 as compared with $1.66 in fiscal 2008.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ending May 30, 2009, the Company expects net sales will increase between 7% and 9% and expects comparable store sales will increase 5% to 7%. The Company expects earnings per diluted share will be between $0.54 and $0.58 as compared with $0.46 in the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
