Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Third Quarter Comparable Store Sales Increase 6.2%
Company Updates Third Quarter Earnings Guidance
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 4, 2009--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that net sales for the third quarter ended May 30, 2009, increased 8.2% to approximately $1.84 billion compared with $1.70 billion for the third quarter ended May 31, 2008. Comparable store sales for the third quarter increased 6.2%. The Company had 6,654 stores as of May 30, 2009, including 26 new stores opened during the quarter.
Our sales momentum continued through the third quarter, with comparable store sales increasing more than 7% through the first twelve weeks of the quarter. As expected, the last week of the reporting period was adversely affected by a shift of the first-of-the month money flow and our corresponding advertising into the June period, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and CEO. Sales of consumable merchandise continued to be strong, increasing approximately 13% during the quarter. Notably, sales trends in several discretionary categories improved from what we saw in the second quarter.
Outlook
The Company expects that earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 will be at or above the upper end of its previously provided guidance of $0.54 and $0.58. The Company plans to report third quarter financial results on July 8, 2009, before the market opens.
