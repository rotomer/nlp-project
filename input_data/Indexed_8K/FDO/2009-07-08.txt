Family Dollar Reports Record Third Quarter Earnings
Earnings per diluted share increases 34.8% to $0.62
Operating margin increases 160 basis points
Management increases earnings guidance
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 8, 2009--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) today reported that net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ended May 30, 2009, increased 34.8% to $0.62 per diluted share compared with $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 ended May 31, 2008. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 increased 35.5% to $87.7 million compared with net income of $64.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
In todays environment, Family Dollars commitment to value has great appeal. Customers are shopping us more frequently and relying on us to meet more of their basic needs. As a result, we continue to gain market share, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
For fifty years, our strategy of providing customers with value and convenience has enabled us to weather past recessionary cycles well. But, we also have experienced strong growth during recovery periods as customers have increased their discretionary spend, continued Levine. While we cant predict when the current environment will improve, the investments we are making to be more relevant to our customers and to improve the in-store experience position us well to meet our customers evolving needs.
As previously reported, net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 were $1.843 billion, or 8.3% above sales of $1.702 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Sales in comparable stores increased 6.2%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of increased customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions, and an increase in the value of the average customer transaction. Sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 were strongest in the Consumables category.
Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 36.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to 34.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The improvement in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was a result of lower freight expense, lower inventory shrinkage and higher purchase mark-ups which more than offset stronger sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 8.3% to $528.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to $487.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were flat in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Most expenses, including occupancy and payroll costs, were leveraged during the quarter as a result of a strong comparable store sales increase and continued expense management. These improvements were offset by higher incentive compensation and higher insurance expense.
The Companys inventories at May 30, 2009, were $1.035 billion, or 3.0% more than inventories of $1.005 billion at May 31, 2008. Inventory per store increased 1.3%. Reflecting increased customer demand, inventory of consumable merchandise was higher, offsetting lower inventory in more discretionary categories.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $38.5 million. As of May 30, 2009, the Company had authorization to purchase up to an additional $94.6 million of its common stock.
Outlook
While we continue to believe that the underlying sales trends remain strong, we expect that the sales increase for the quarter will be affected by the cycling of last years stimulus checks, said Mr. Levine. The quarter is off to a good start, with sales in comparable stores increasing an estimated 2% in June.
At Family Dollar, we have consistently reinvested in our business to drive stronger shareholder returns. Reflecting this strategy, we are investing aggressively in a chain-wide store technology refresh which supports the acceptance of credit cards and food stamps. In addition, this quarter we are initiating efforts to re-align space in our stores to accommodate strong customer demand and improve the in-store shopping experience. These investments will add incremental expense pressure in the fourth quarter but will position us to drive sustainable growth beyond the current quarter, concluded Mr. Levine.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 ending August 29, 2009, the Company expects that net sales will increase between 4% and 6% and expects comparable store sales will increase 2% to 4%. Reflecting the anticipated impact from lower freight expense, lower inventory shrinkage and investments the Company is making to enhance the shopping experience, the Company expects that earnings per diluted share will be between $0.39 and $0.43 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared with $0.38 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
For the fiscal year ending August 29, 2009, the Company expects that earnings per diluted share will be between $2.03 and $2.07 in fiscal 2009 as compared with $1.66 in fiscal 2008.
