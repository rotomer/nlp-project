Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Fourth Quarter Comparable Store Sales Increase 1.0%
Company Reaffirms Fourth Quarter Earnings Guidance
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 3, 2009--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that net sales for the fourth quarter ended August 29, 2009, increased 2.6% to approximately $1.811 billion compared with $1.766 billion for the fourth quarter ended August 30, 2008. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter increased 1.0%. The Company had 6,655 stores as of August 29, 2009, including 32 new stores opened during the quarter.
As expected, our fourth quarter sales results were impacted as we anniversaried the effect of last years stimulus package. In addition, this quarter we continued our aggressive pace of investments, and re-aligned space in approximately half our chain, said Howard Levine, Chairman and CEO. Although the repositioning of categories to create better merchandise adjacencies and expand our selection of consumables resulted in some temporary disruption, customers are responding well to the improved shopping experience. We are pleased with the progress we have made and believe that these changes position us well for continued growth in fiscal 2010.
Fourth Quarter Earnings Outlook
Reflecting sales results for the fourth quarter, the Company continues to expect that earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 will be between $0.39 and $0.43. The Company plans to report fourth quarter financial results on October 7, 2009, before the market opens.
