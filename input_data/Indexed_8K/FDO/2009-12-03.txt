Exhibit 99
Family Dollar First Quarter Comparable Store Sales Increase 2.4%
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 3, 2009--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that net sales for the first quarter ended November 28, 2009, increased 3.9% to $1.823 billion from $1.754 billion in the first quarter ended November 29, 2008. Comparable store sales for the quarter increased 2.4%. The Company had 6,665 stores as of November 28, 2009, including 43 new stores opened in the first quarter.
Customers are responding well to the investments we are making to improve the shopping experience in our stores. We are pleased that customer traffic increased again this quarter. Reflecting continued economic pressures, average transaction value was flat, said Howard Levine, Chairman and CEO. Although sales in the first quarter were slightly below our plan, we remain confident that earnings per diluted share for the first quarter will be within the range of our original earnings expectations of $0.45 to $0.50 per diluted share.
