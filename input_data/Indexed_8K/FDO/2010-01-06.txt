Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Reports Record First Quarter Earnings
Earnings Per Diluted Share Increased 16.7% To $0.49
December Comparable Store Sales Increased Approximately 4%
Management Reaffirms Fiscal 2010 Earnings Guidance
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 6, 2010--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) today reported that net income per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 ended November 28, 2009, increased 16.7% to $0.49 compared with $0.42 for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 ended November 29, 2008. Net income for the quarter increased 14.0% to $67.6 million compared with net income of $59.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
We have increased our relevancy across our diverse customer base and are positioned to accelerate top line growth, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. I am confident that our efforts to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our customer communications and improve the in-store shopping experience will result in continued market share growth and strong financial returns.
As previously reported, sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 were approximately $1.823billion, or 3.9% above sales of approximately $1.754 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales increased 2.4%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of an increase in customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions; average transaction value for the quarter was flat. Sales were strongest in the Consumables category.
The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 36.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to 35.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The improvement in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was a result of reductions in freight expense, shrinkage, and seasonal markdowns.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 30.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 compared with 29.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The increase in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of expenses related to expanded store operating hours, the continued rollout of new point-of-sale technology and the Companys space realignment efforts. These increases more than offset lower insurance expense and lower utility expense.
The Companys inventories at November 28, 2009, were $1.028 billion, or 5.9% less than inventories of $1.092 billion at November 29, 2008. Average inventory per store at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was approximately 7% lower than the average inventory per store at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, capital expenditures were $39.1 million compared with $28.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company opened 43 new stores and closed 33 stores. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 0.9 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $24.8 million. The Company has authorization to purchase up to an additional $437.2 million of its common stock.
Holiday Season Update
Customers clearly appreciated the great toys and gifts we offered this holiday season, said Levine. I am pleased to report that comparable store sales for the December reporting period increased approximately 4%.
Outlook
For the second quarter, the Company expects that comparable sales for the quarter will increase 2% to 4% and that earnings per share will be between $0.65 and $0.70 compared with $0.60 in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
Commenting on expectations for the rest of the year, Levine said, We are investing to drive stronger top-line growth and expect to build sales momentum through the second half of the year. Reflecting the cadence of these initiatives, we expect comps will increase 3% to 5% in the second half of fiscal 2010.
For the full year, the Company expects that net sales for fiscal 2010 will increase 4% to 6% as compared with fiscal 2009. Reflecting these expectations, the Company continues to project that earnings per share will be between $2.15 and $2.35 in fiscal 2010.
