Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings
Earnings per diluted share increases 35.0% to $0.81
Net income increases 33.4%
Operating profit margin increases 195 basis points
Management increases full year guidance
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 7, 2010--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) today reported that net income per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 ended February 27, 2010, increased 35.0% to $0.81 compared with $0.60 for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 ended February 28, 2009. Net income for the quarter increased 33.4% to $112.2 million compared with net income of $84.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
These strong results reflect our efforts to provide our customers with more value, more convenience and a better shopping experience, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We have invested significantly to improve processes, build merchandising capabilities and stabilize our workforce, and these investments are clearly delivering results. As we increase our focus on accelerating revenue growth, I am confident that our continued efforts to broaden the appeal of our assortment, strengthen our customer communications and improve the in-store shopping experience will result in expanded market share and strong financial returns.
As previously reported, sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 were approximately $2.09billion, or 4.9% above sales of approximately $1.99 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales increased 3.6%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of increased customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions, and an increase in the value of the average customer transaction. Sales were strong in the Seasonal and Electronics, Home Products and Consumables categories. Sales of Apparel and Accessories were approximately flat.
The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 35.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to 33.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. The improvement in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was a result of higher purchase mark-ups and reductions in markdown expenses, freight expenses and inventory shrinkage.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 26.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 compared with 27.0% in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. The decrease in SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of lower utility costs and lower insurance expense which more than offset higher expenses related to expanded store operating hours and certain store maintenance and repair costs.
The Companys inventories at February 27, 2010, were $935.3 million, or 9.6% less than inventories of $1,035.2 million at February 28, 2009.
In the first half of fiscal 2010, capital expenditures were $82.9 million compared with $61.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2009. During the first half of fiscal 2010, the Company opened 86 new stores and closed 52 stores.
During the first half of fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares of its common stock. As of February 27, 2010, the Company had authorization to purchase up to an additional $296.0 million of its common stock.
Outlook
I am pleased to report that the sales momentum we saw in the second quarter has continued through March, said Levine. Reflecting favorable weather trends and the impact of the Easter shift, comparable store sales for the March reporting period increased approximately 11%.
For the third quarter, the Company expects that comparable sales for the quarter will increase 6% to 8% and that earnings per share will be between $0.71 and $0.76 compared with $0.62 in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
For the full year, the Company expects that earnings per share will be between $2.48 and $2.58 compared with $2.07 in fiscal 2009.
