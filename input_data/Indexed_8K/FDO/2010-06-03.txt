MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 2010--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that net sales for the third quarter ended May 29, 2010, increased 8.4% to $1.997 billion from $1.843 billion in the third quarter ended May 30, 2009. Comparable store sales for the quarter increased 7.0%. Sales during the quarter were strongest in the Seasonal and Consumable categories. The Company had 6,724 stores as of May 29, 2010, including 39 new stores opened in the third quarter.
The investments we are making to accelerate revenue growth are delivering results, said Howard Levine, Chairman and CEO.
