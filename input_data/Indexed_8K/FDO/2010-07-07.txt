Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Reports Record Third Quarter Earnings
Earnings per diluted share increase 24.2% to $0.77
Net income increases 19.0%
Operating profit margin increases 98 basis points
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 7, 2010--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) today reported that net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 ended May 29, 2010, increased 24.2% to $0.77 compared with $0.62 for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 ended May 30, 2009. Net income for the quarter increased 19.0% to $104.4 million compared with net income of $87.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
We continue to deliver greater value for our customers while improving their shopping experience in our stores. As a result, more and more consumers are finding the savings they need at Family Dollar, said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our revenue growth has accelerated nicely, and I am pleased to report our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth.
As previously reported, sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 were approximately $1.997billion, or 8.4% above sales of approximately $1.843 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales increased 7.0%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of increased customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions. Average transaction value for the quarter was flat. Sales were strongest in the Seasonal and Electronics and Consumables categories.
The gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 36.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to 36.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The improvement in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was a result of reductions in markdown expenses and inventory shrinkage.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 28.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 compared with 28.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Most expenses, including occupancy costs, were leveraged during the quarter as a result of a strong comparable store sales increase and continued productivity improvements. In addition, insurance and incentive compensation expenses were lower during the quarter. These improvements more than offset investments related to expanded store operating hours and increased advertising.
The Companys inventories at May 29, 2010, were $986.1 million, or 4.8% less than inventories of $1,035.3 million at May 30, 2009.
In the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, capital expenditures were $136.4 million compared with $103.2 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2009. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company opened 125 new stores and closed 56 stores.
During the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares of its common stock. As of May 29, 2010, the Company had authorization to purchase up to an additional $190.3 million of its common stock.
Outlook
As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect that many of the trends we saw in the third quarter will continue. However, the environment remains challenging for consumers, and customers continue to buy close to need, said Mr. Levine. The fourth quarter is off to a good start, with sales in comparable stores increasing an estimated 5.5% in June.
For the fourth quarter, the Company expects that comparable store sales will increase 5% to 7% and that earnings per share will be between $0.46 and $0.51 compared with $0.43 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
For the full year, the Company expects that earnings per share will be between $2.53 and $2.58 compared with $2.07 in fiscal 2009.
