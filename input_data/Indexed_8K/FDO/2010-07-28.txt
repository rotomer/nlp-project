MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 28, 2010--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) today issued a statement in response to the Schedule 13D filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Trian Fund Management, L.P.:
Family Dollars Board of Directors and management team are dedicated to building value for all shareholders. The Company is interested in the views and opinions of its shareholders and recently met with representatives of Trian Fund Management, L.P.
Over the last several years, Family Dollar has invested to improve processes and capabilities throughout the organization. As a result, the Company has achieved nine consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings per share growth, significantly expanded operating margins and improved inventory productivity.
The Company noted that its stock price has appreciated by more than 41% so far this year, as compared with a slight decline for the S&P 500 Index and a 0.8% decline in the S&P Retail Composite during the same period. For the three years ending July 27, 2010, the Companys stock price has appreciated by more than 30% as compared to a decline of 23.6% for the S&P 500 Index and a decline of 15.8% in the S&P Retail Composite over the same period.
Further, Family Dollar continues to return excess cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company has paid approximately $58 million in dividends and repurchased approximately $272 million of its common stock. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Family Dollar had approximately $190 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
As the Company has previously disclosed, Family Dollar is investing to drive stronger revenue growth and to further expand operating margins. The Company plans to update investors on its business initiatives, strategic plans and financial outlook when it reports results for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2010.
