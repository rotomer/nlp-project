"Our comparable store sales increase of 6.9% is the best first quarter result we've delivered in more than twelve years," said Howard R. Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "Clearly, our investments to improve the shopping experience in our stores are positioning us well to serve a growing number of Family Dollar customers."
First Quarter Results
Comparable store sales for the first quarter increased 6.9%. The increase in comparable store sales was a result of an increase in customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions; average transaction value for the quarter was approximately flat. Although sales increased in all merchandise categories, sales were strongest in the Consumables category driven primarily by double-digit increases in candy and food.  
Gross profit margin, as a percentage of sales, was 36.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to 36.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  The decline in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was a result of stronger sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise and higher freight expense, which were mostly offset by lower inventory shrinkage.  
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 29.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 compared with 30.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.   Most expenses, including occupancy costs, were leveraged during the quarter as a result of a strong comparable store sales increase.  These improvements were partially offset by investments related to expanded store operating hours, store renovations and enhanced marketing efforts.  
The Company's inventories at November 27, 2010, were $1.138 billion, or 10.8% greater than inventories of $1.028 billion at November 28, 2009.  Average inventory per store at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was approximately 8% higher than the average inventory per store at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  The increase in inventories was primarily a result of investments to support higher in-stock levels in stores and expansions of consumable assortments, particularly in renovated stores.  
In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, capital expenditures were $38.9 million compared with $39.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company opened 85 new stores and closed 18 stores compared to 43 new stores and 33 closings in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In addition, since launching its multi-year renovation initiative in August, the Company has completed 202 store renovations, including 173 renovations during the first quarter.
As part of its previously announced $750 million share repurchase authorization, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement in October 2010 to repurchase $250 million of its common stock.  During the first quarter, the Company received approximately 4.4 million shares related to this transaction.  The Company has authorization to purchase up to an additional $500 million of its common stock.
Holiday Season Update
"Our stores had a busy holiday season, resulting in a comparable stores sales increase for December of approximately 4% with strong performance in the toy and consumable areas," said Levine.  
Outlook
Reflecting the Company's performance year-to-date through December, the Company now expects that diluted earnings per share will be between $3.08 and $3.23 compared with $2.62 in fiscal 2010.  This expectation includes an additional $0.04 related to the estimated impact of the continuation of the Company's stock repurchase program.
The Company's outlook for fiscal 2011 is based on the following assumptions which may or may not prove valid:
An increase in net sales of between 8% and 10%;
An increase in comparable store sales of between 5% and 7%;
Approximately 300 new store openings and 80-100 store closings;
A modest increase in operating profit, as a percentage of sales;
An effective income tax rate of approximately 37%;
Weighted average diluted shares of approximately 125.5 million, reflecting additional stock repurchases in fiscal 2011; and
Capital expenditures of between $300 million and $350 million.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company expects that comparable store sales will increase 5% to 6% and that earnings per diluted share will be between $0.92 and $0.97 per share compared with $0.81 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.
