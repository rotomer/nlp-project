Supplemental Indenture
On January 28, 2011, Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (the "Company") completed its offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Notes") and, in connection with the issuance of the Notes, entered into an indenture, dated as of January 28, 2011, with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") (the "Base Indenture"), the form of which was filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (Registration No. 333-171843), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on January 25, 2011 (the "Registration Statement"), and a supplemental indenture, dated as of January 28, 2011, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture," and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto.
The Notes are the unsecured senior obligations of the Company, rank in right of payment with all of the Company's unsubordinated, unsecured indebtedness and are senior in right of payment to all of the Company's subordinated indebtedness. The Notes mature on February 1, 2021, and bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing August 1, 2011.
pari passu
The Notes are not entitled to any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments. At any time and from time to time, the Notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at the Company's option, on at least 30 days', but not more than 60 days', prior notice to holders at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued and unpaid to, but not including the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture) plus 30 basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date.
If a change of control triggering event (certain negative ratings repercussions as a result of certain changes in control of the Company, as described more fully in the Supplemental Indenture) occurs, the Company will be required to offer to purchase the Notes from the holders at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Notes.
In the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or certain of its subsidiaries, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other event of default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of all Notes immediately due and payable.
The Indenture contains certain restrictions, including a limitation that restricts the Company's ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to create or incur secured indebtedness. Certain sale and leaseback transactions are similarly limited.
The Trustee and/or its affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us, or our affiliates, including acting as lenders under various loan facilities.
The foregoing description of the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture is qualified in its entirety by reference to such documents.
 
The Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, which are governed by the Indenture, in an underwritten public offering on January 28, 2011.
Additional information included in Item 1.01 above and in Item 8.01 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on January 27, 2011 regarding the Notes is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03, and the foregoing description of the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture and the form of Global Note which is included as part of Exhibit 4.1 filed herewith.

Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder received the notice. In any case, failure to duly give such notice to the holder of any Note designated for redemption in whole or in part, or
Redemption Price
Redemption Date
 
any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Note.
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption and the Redemption Price at which the Notes are to be redeemed, and shall state that payment of the Redemption Price of such Notes to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, upon presentation and surrender of such Notes, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice and, that from and after said date interest will cease to accrue; except that interest shall continue to accrue on any such Note or portion thereof with respect to which the Company defaults in the payment of such Redemption Price and accrued interest. If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of the Notes to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Notes to be redeemed. In case any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such security, a new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days' notice in advance of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair in its discretion and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (provided that no Notes of a principal amount of one thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000) or less shall be redeemed in part) of the principal amount of such Notes of a denomination larger than $2,000, the Notes to be redeemed and shall thereafter promptly notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Notes to be redeemed, in whole or in part.

In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions stated herein.
 
Subject to Section 2.11 of the Base Indenture, the Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of the Notes selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Notes so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any such Notes being redeemed in part.
If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Notes or portions of the Notes to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable Redemption Price, and interest on such Notes shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Redemption Price and accrued interest.
Prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with a paying agent or the Trustee money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Notes to be redeemed on that date other than Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption which on or prior thereto have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation. If such money is then held by the Company in trust and is not required for such purpose it shall be discharged from such trust.
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem those Notes by notifying the holders thereof to that effect as described above, the Company shall make an offer (a "") to each holder of Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to two thousand U.S. dollars ($2,000) or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder's Notes on the terms set forth below. In a Change of Control Offer, the Company shall offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase (a ""). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to holders of the Notes, describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Notes and offering to repurchase the Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or, if the notice is mailed prior to the Change of Control, no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date on which the Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Notes occurs (a ""). The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the

The Company shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions herein, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions herein by virtue of any such conflict.
The Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, may execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Notes; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the holders of each Note then Outstanding (i) extend the fixed maturity of the Notes, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the Notes, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Family Dollar Stores, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with its offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-171843) and the prospectus dated January 25, 2011, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated January 25, 2011 (together the "Prospectus") of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Securities"). The Securities were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of January 28, 2011 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated January 28, 2011 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") between the Company and the Trustee.
Family Dollar Stores, Inc., p. 2
In arriving at the opinion expressed below, we have reviewed the following documents:
 
 
 
 
In addition, we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other instruments and other certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and such other persons, and we have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinion expressed below.
In rendering the opinion expressed below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have reviewed.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that the Securities have been validly issued by the Company and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
Family Dollar Stores, Inc., p. 3
Insofar as the foregoing opinion relates to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, (a) we have assumed that the Company and each other party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (except that no such assumption is made as to the Company regarding matters of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the federal law of the United States of America or the law of the State of New York that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such agreement or obligation) and (b) such opinion is subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, including applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting the Law, and the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware.
We hereby consent to the use of our name in the Prospectus, under the heading "Legal Matters," as counsel for the Company who has passed on the validity of the Securities and to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 28, 2011. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Rules and Regulations of the Commission thereunder. The opinion expressed herein is rendered on and as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to advise you, or to
Family Dollar Stores, Inc., p. 4
make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinion expressed herein.
