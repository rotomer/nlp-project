Company Increases Guidance for Second Quarter EPS
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 14, 2011--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) reported that net sales for the second quarter ended February 26, 2011, increased 8.3% to $2.26 billion from $2.09 billion in the second quarter ended February 27, 2010. Comparable store sales for the quarter increased 5.1%. Although January sales were negatively impacted by winter storms, February sales benefited from early spring-like weather. Sales during the quarter were strongest in the Consumable and Seasonal categories. The Company had 6,888 stores as of February 26, 2011, including 61 new stores opened in the second quarter.
Family Dollar continues to execute well against our strategic plan to accelerate revenue growth, expand operating margins and optimize our capital structure, said Howard Levine, Chairman and CEO. Our investments to improve the shopping experience for our customers while enhancing our operational capabilities continue to deliver strong returns.
Year-to-date through the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company has:
delivered a 6.0% increase in comparable store sales;
opened 146 new stores compared with 86 new store openings in the first half of fiscal 2010;
renovated 313 stores and is on target to reach its stated goal of 800 store renovations in fiscal 2011;
completed an initial public debt offering of $300 million in 10-year notes;
repurchased 8.9 million shares at a total cost of approximately $408 million; and
increased the quarterly cash dividend by 16.1%.
Outlook
The Company now expects that earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 will be in the range of $0.97 to $0.98 per diluted share, compared with $0.81 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company expects to report second quarter financial results on March 30, 2011, before the market opens.
