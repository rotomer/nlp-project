MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 29, 2011--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) today reported record sales and earnings results for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 ended May 28, 2011. Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 7.8% to $2.153 billion compared to $1.997 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Net income for the quarter increased 6.5% to $111.1 million compared to net income of $104.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Net income per diluted share for the quarter increased 18.2% to $0.91 compared to $0.77 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
We accomplished much this quarter to position us to capture greater market share and execute our longer-term vision for Family Dollar, said Howard Levine, Chairman and CEO. I remain confident that our strategy of providing customers with value and convenience, combined with the impactful investments we are making to improve the shopping experience in our stores and our profitability, will continue to deliver strong shareholder returns.
Third Quarter Results
Building on a 7.0% comparable store sales increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 increased 4.7%. The increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2011 was a result of increased customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions, and an increase in the value of the average customer transaction. Sales during the quarter were strongest in the Consumables and Home Products categories.
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 36.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The decline in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was primarily a result of the impact of stronger sales of lower-margin consumables, increased promotional markdowns and higher freight expense. These pressures were partially offset by benefits from continued investments in price management capabilities, private brands and global sourcing and lower inventory shrinkage.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 6.3% to $595.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to $560.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 27.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to 28.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Most expenses were leveraged during the quarter. As a percentage of sales, lower incentive compensation expense and lower store labor expense offset investments to support revenue growth, including store renovations, the acceleration of new store growth and enhanced marketing efforts.
Operating profit increased 8.4% to $184.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to $170.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. As a percentage of sales, operating margin expanded to 8.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 as compared to 8.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
Inventories at May 28, 2011, were $1,134.4 million, or 15.0% more than inventories of $986.1 million at May 29, 2010. Average inventory per store at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was approximately 11% higher than the average inventory per store at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The increase in inventories was primarily a result of the expansion of Consumables. During the third quarter, the Company expanded its assortment of food by approximately 20% and its assortment of health and beauty aids by approximately 25% in more than 5,000 stores.
In the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, capital expenditures were $230.3 million compared to $136.4 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, the Company opened 206 new stores and closed 48 stores compared to 125 store openings and 56 closings in the first three quarters of fiscal 2010. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, the Company completed 680 store renovations, including 367 renovations during the third quarter.
Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 10.9 million shares at a total cost of approximately $512.5 million. As of May 28, 2011, the Company had authorization to purchase up to an additional $245.3 million of its common stock.
Outlook
For the fourth quarter, the Company expects comparable sales for the quarter to increase between 5% and 7% and earnings per share to be between $0.62 and $0.70 compared to $0.56 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
For the full year, the Company expects that earnings per share will be between $3.08 and $3.16 compared to $2.62 in fiscal 2010. The Company's outlook for fiscal 2011 is based on the following assumptions which may or may not prove valid:
An increase in net sales of between 8% and 9%;
An increase in comparable store sales of between 5% and 6%;
Approximately 300 new store openings and 60 to 80 store closings;
More than 900 store renovations;
A modest increase in operating profit, as a percentage of sales;
Net interest expense of approximately $20 million;
An effective income tax rate of between 37% and 37.5%;
