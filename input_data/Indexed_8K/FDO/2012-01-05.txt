Exhibit 99
Family Dollar Reports Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings
First Quarter Comparable Store Sales Increased 4.1%
Earnings Per Diluted Share Increased 17.2% To $0.68
December Comparable Store Sales Increased Approximately 4%
Management Reaffirms Earnings Guidance for FY12
MATTHEWS, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 5, 2012--Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (NYSE: FDO) today reported that net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 ended November 26, 2011, increased 7.6% to $2.148billion compared to $1.997 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Net income for the quarter increased 8.1% to $80.4 million compared with net income of $74.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Net income per diluted share for the quarter increased 17.2% to $0.68 compared with $0.58 for the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
Today, we reported another quarter of record earnings. We opened 101 stores, nearly 20% more than in the first quarter last year, and we entered an important new market, California. We delivered a 4.1% comparable store sales increase on top of a 6.9% increase last year, and we expanded first quarter operating margin to the highest rate since 2004, said Howard Levine, Chairman and CEO. The environment continues to be challenging for our customers, and our experienced team remains focused on executing our long-term strategy. We have tremendous opportunity to expand our market share further and improve our store productivity, and I am confident that our investments to better meet the needs of our customers will continue to position us to deliver strong financial returns for our shareholders.
First Quarter Results
Comparable store sales in the first quarter increased 4.1%. The increase in comparable store sales was the result of a higher average customer transaction value and increased customer traffic, as measured by the number of register transactions. Sales in the quarter were led by an 11.4% increase in the Consumables category, its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth.
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 35.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 36.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The decline in gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was due primarily to the impact of stronger sales of lower-margin consumables, which was mostly offset by higher purchase mark-ups resulting from our continued investments in private brands, global sourcing and price management capabilities. In addition, higher markdowns, increased inventory shrinkage and higher freight costs negatively impacted gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 29.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared with 29.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Most expenses were leveraged during the quarter. As a percentage of net sales, lower insurance and store labor expenses were partially offset by investments to drive revenue growth, including store renovations, enhanced marketing efforts, and the acceleration of new store growth.
Operating profit increased 11.0% to $134.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as compared to $121.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. As a percentage of net sales, operating profit expanded to 6.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as compared to 6.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
Interest expense increased to $6.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as compared to $3.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of senior unsecured notes due 2021 in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
The Companys inventories at November 26, 2011, were $1.302 billion, or 14.3% greater than inventories of $1.138 billion at November 27, 2010. Average inventory per store at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was approximately 10% higher than the average inventory per store at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The increase in inventories was primarily the result of our investments to expand key consumable categories to drive sales growth and meet customer demand.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, capital expenditures were $130.9 million compared with $38.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily a result of a greater number of store renovations, increased new store openings, and expenditures related to the construction of the Companys 10 distribution center. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company opened 101 new stores and closed 4 stores compared to 85 new stores and 18 closings in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In addition, the Company renovated, relocated or expanded 262 stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 184 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
th
During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $27.4 million. As of November 26, 2011, the Company had the authorization to purchase up to an additional $309.9 million of its common stock.
Outlook
Comparable stores sales for December increased approximately 4% driven primarily by increased customer traffic, said Levine. Consumables delivered another month of double-digit sales growth, and we expect that this momentum will continue through January and February, when customers are even more focused on basic needs.
The Company anticipates that many of the trends that occurred in the first quarter will continue in the second quarter. The Company expects that comparable store sales will increase around 5% and that earnings per diluted share will be between $1.10 and $1.18 per share, compared with $0.98 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
Reflecting the Companys performance year-to-date through December, the Company continues to expect that diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012 will be between $3.50 and $3.75 compared with $3.12 in fiscal 2011.
The Company's outlook for fiscal 2012 is based on the following assumptions which may or may not prove valid:
An increase in net sales of between 8% and 10%;
An increase in comparable store sales of between 4% and 6%;
Approximately 450-500 new store openings and 80-100 store closings;
Gross margin pressure for the full year, with improving trends through the year as many of the pressures faced in the second half of fiscal 2011 are cycled;
SG&A expense growth of between 6-7%;
An effective income tax rate of between 37.0% and 37.5%;
Weighted average diluted shares of approximately 118 million; and
Capital expenditures of between $550 million and $600 million to support new store openings, store renovations, purchases of stores, and expansion of the Companys supply chain.
