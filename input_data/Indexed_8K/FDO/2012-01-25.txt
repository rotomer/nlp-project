There were 9,131,734 broker non-votes with respect to the approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers.
(3) To approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, with 89,261,597 shares voted for EVERY YEAR, 145,503 shares voted for EVERY TWO YEARS, 7,228,138 shares voted for EVERY THREE YEARS and 386,124 shares abstaining.
