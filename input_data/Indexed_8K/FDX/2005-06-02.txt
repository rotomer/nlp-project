Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
FY2006 Annual Incentive Compensation Plans
 
On May 26, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of FedEx Corporation established annual incentive cash bonus plans for FedEx's executive officers for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2006 ("").
FY2006
 
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
 
Frederick W. Smith's FY2006 annual bonus will be determined by the achievement of corporate objectives for consolidated pre-tax income for FY2006.  The Compensation Committee may adjust Mr. Smith's bonus amount upward or downward based on its consideration of several factors, including: FedEx's stock price performance relative to the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index, the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; FedEx's revenue and operating income growth relative to competitors; FedEx's cash flow; FedEx's U.S. revenue market share; FedEx's reputation rankings by various publications and surveys; and the Compensation Committee's assessment of the quality and effectiveness of Mr. Smith's leadership during FY2006.  None of these factors will be given any particular weight by the Compensation Committee in determining whether to adjust Mr. Smith's bonus amount.  Mr. Smith's annual bonus target for FY2006 is 130% of his base salary, with a maximum payout of 300% of his base salary.
 
Taking into account these objectives and factors, the Compensation Committee will recommend to the independent members of the Board of Directors an annual bonus for FY2006 that, when combined with Mr. Smith's base salary, has a 75 percentile target for total annual salary and bonus for chief executive officers in executive compensation surveys utilized by the Compensation Committee.
th
 
The independent members of the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the FY2006 annual bonus plan for Mr. Smith on May 27, 2005.
 
Non-CEO Executive Officers
 
FedEx Corporation executive vice presidents will participate in the annual incentive cash bonus plan for headquarters employees.  Under this plan, the annual bonus target for each executive is 90% of his or her base salary, with a maximum payout of 240% of base salary.  A threshold payout of up to 30% of the target bonus is based on the achievement of individual objectives to be established at the beginning of the fiscal year for each executive.  Mr. Smith will determine the achievement of each executive's individual objectives at the conclusion of FY2006.  The balance of the bonus payout is based on FedEx's consolidated pre-tax income for FY2006 and ranges, on a sliding scale, from a threshold amount if the plan's pre-established consolidated pre-tax income objectives are minimally achieved up to a maximum amount if such financial performance goals are substantially exceeded.
Each of the presidents of FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Kinko's will participate in the annual incentive cash bonus plan sponsored by his respective company.  The target annual bonus for the president of FedEx Express is 100% of his base salary, with a maximum payout of 240% of his base salary.  The target annual bonus for the president of each of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Kinko's is 80% of base salary, with a maximum payout of 240% of base salary.  A threshold payout of up to 30% of the target bonus is based on the achievement of individual objectives to be established at the beginning of the fiscal year for each executive.  Mr. Smith will determine the achievement of each executive's individual objectives at the conclusion of FY2006.  The balance of the payout under each of the plans is based on each respective subsidiary's operating income and FedEx's consolidated pre-tax income for FY2006 and ranges, on a sliding scale, from a threshold amount if the plan's pre-established subsidiary operating income and FedEx's consolidated pre-tax income objectives are minimally achieved up to a maximum amount if such financial performance goals are substantially exceeded.
 
Total annual salary and bonus for these executive officers for FY2006 (assuming achievement of all individual and corporate objectives as described above) is targeted at the 75 percentile of total annual salary and bonus for comparable positions in the comparison surveys utilized by the Compensation Committee.
th
 
FY2006  FY2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan
 
On May 26, 2005, the Compensation Committee established a long-term performance bonus plan to provide a long-term cash bonus opportunity to members of upper management, including executive officers, at the conclusion of FedEx's fiscal year ending May 31, 2008 ("") if FedEx achieves an aggregate earnings-per-share goal established by the Compensation Committee with respect to the three-fiscal-year period 2006 through 2008.  No amounts can be earned for the FY2006  FY2008 plan until 2008 because achievement of the earnings-per-share goal can only be determined following the conclusion of FY2008.
FY2008
 
The following table sets forth estimates of the possible future payouts to each of FedEx's named executive officers other than Kenneth R. Masterson, who retired as FedEx's Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary effective June 1, 2005.  Each of the officers listed below, together with Mr. Masterson, were named executive officers for purposes of FedEx's 2004 proxy statement and are expected to keep such status for the 2005 proxy statement, which FedEx expects to file in August 2005.
 
 
The estimated individual future payouts set forth in the table above are set dollar amounts ranging from threshold amounts, if the earnings-per-share goal achieved is less than target, up to maximum amounts, if the plan goal is substantially exceeded.  There can be no assurance that the estimated future payouts shown in this table will be achieved.
 
The full Board of Directors (and the independent members of the Board with respect to Mr. Smith), upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the FY2006  FY2008 long-term incentive plan on May 27, 2005.
 
FY2006 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Grants
 
On June 1, 2005, the named executive officers, other than Mr. Masterson, were granted stock option and restricted stock awards as follows:
 
 
The stock options granted to the named executive officers have an exercise price of $89.70 and vest ratably in four annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.  The restrictions on the restricted shares awarded to the named executive officers lapse ratably in four annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.  In addition, each named executive officer will receive a tax reimbursement payment related to his restricted stock award.
