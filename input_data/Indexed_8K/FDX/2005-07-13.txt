FY2005 Annual Bonus Payouts
 
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
 
The annual bonus for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 ("") for Frederick W. Smith, FedEx's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, was determined by the achievement of corporate objectives for consolidated pre-tax income for FY2005.  The Compensation Committee of the FedEx Board of Directors could adjust this amount upward or downward based on its consideration of several factors, including: FedEx's stock price performance relative to the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index, the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; FedEx's revenue and operating income growth relative to competitors; FedEx's cash flow; FedEx's return on invested capital; FedEx's U.S. revenue market share; FedEx's reputation rankings by various publications and surveys; and the Committee's assessment of the quality and effectiveness of Mr. Smith's leadership during FY2005.  None of these factors was given any particular weight by the Compensation Committee in determining whether to adjust Mr. Smith's bonus amount.  Mr. Smith's annual bonus target for FY2005 was 115% of his base salary, with a maximum payout of 300% of his base salary.
FY2005
 
On July 11, 2005, the independent members of the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved an FY2005 annual bonus of $3,343,376 for Mr. Smith.
 
Non-CEO Named Executive Officers
 
FedEx Corporation executive vice presidents participated in the FY2005 annual incentive cash bonus plan established for headquarters employees.  Under this plan, the annual bonus target for each executive was 90% of his base salary, with a maximum payout of 240% of base salary.  A threshold payout of up to 30% of the target bonus was based on the achievement of individual objectives established at the beginning of the fiscal year for each executive.  The achievement level of each executive's individual objectives was based on Mr. Smith's evaluation at the conclusion of FY2005.  The balance of the bonus payout was based on FedEx's consolidated pre-tax income for FY2005 and ranged, on a sliding scale, from a minimum amount if the plan's pre-established consolidated pre-tax income threshold was achieved up to a maximum amount if such financial performance goal was substantially exceeded.
 
The president of FedEx Express participated in the FY2005 annual incentive cash bonus plan sponsored by FedEx Express.  His target annual bonus was 100% of his base salary, with a maximum payout of 240% of his base salary.  A threshold payout of up to 30% of his target bonus was based on the achievement of individual objectives established at the beginning of the fiscal year.  The achievement level of his individual objectives was based on Mr. Smith's evaluation at the conclusion of FY2005.  The balance of the bonus payout was based on FedEx
Express's operating income (30% of the target bonus) and FedEx's consolidated pre-tax income (40% of the target bonus) for FY2005 and ranged, on a sliding scale, from a minimum amount if the plan's pre-established subsidiary operating income and FedEx's consolidated pre-tax income thresholds were achieved up to a maximum amount if such financial performance goals were substantially exceeded.
 
The following table sets forth the FY2005 annual bonus amount for each of FedEx's non-CEO named executive officers.
 
 
Mr. Masterson retired as FedEx's Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary effective June 1, 2005.

FY2003  FY2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan Payouts
 
In 2002, the Compensation Committee established a long-term incentive cash bonus plan for members of upper management, including executive officers.  This plan provided a bonus opportunity following the conclusion of FY2005 if FedEx achieved an aggregate earnings-per-share goal established by the Compensation Committee with respect to the three-fiscal-year period 2003 through 2005.  Maximum bonuses were awarded under this plan for FY2005 to all eligible participants because FedEx's performance substantially exceeded the plan goal for the three-fiscal-year period.
The following table sets forth the payouts to FedEx's named executive officers under this plan.
 
 
New Base Salaries of Named Executive Officers
 
The following table sets forth the new annual base salaries of FedEx's named executive officers, other than Mr. Masterson.
 
 
Each named executive officer's annual base salary was increased by 3.5%.  Mr. Smith's new base salary is effective as of July 16, 2005.  The new base salaries of the other named executive officers are effective as of July 1, 2005.
 
The new base salaries of Messrs. Bronczek, Graf and Glenn were set by Mr. Smith within the limits established by the Compensation Committee.  The independent members of the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved Mr. Smith's new base salary on July 11, 2005.
