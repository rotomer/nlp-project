Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Item 1.01.
     
 
On July 20, 2005, FedEx Corporation ("FedEx"), as borrower, entered into a $1 billion five-year credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions (the "Lenders"), including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., individually and as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., individually and as syndication agent, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Regions Bank, and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, each individually and as a co-documentation agent.  The syndicate of Lenders was arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners.
 
The New Credit Agreement replaced and consolidated the $750 million Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of September 28, 2001, as amended, among FedEx, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), individually and as administrative agent, and certain lenders, and the $250 million Amended and Restated 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of September 27, 2002, as amended, among FedEx, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., individually and as administrative agent, and certain lenders (together, the "Terminated Agreements").  The Terminated Agreements were terminated effective July 20, 2005.
 
The New Credit Agreement provides the terms under which the Lenders will make available to FedEx an unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion.  Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement may be used for FedEx's general corporate purposes, including commercial paper back-up and acquisitions.  As of July 25, 2005, FedEx had not made any borrowings under the New Credit Agreement.
 
The Lenders' commitments under the New Credit Agreement will terminate on July 20, 2010, unless terminated earlier by FedEx or by the administrative agent upon an event of default.  FedEx's obligations under the New Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the same FedEx subsidiaries that guarantee FedEx's outstanding public debt securities.
 
Loans under the New Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per year generally equal to, at FedEx's election, either:
 
the greater of (a) the administrative agent's announced prime rate, and (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, plus the applicable margin for such loans ("ABR Loans"); or
 - 
                 
 
the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for the selected term, plus the applicable margin for such loans ("Eurodollar Loans").
 - 
                 
 
FedEx will also pay a facility fee.  The applicable margin for loans and the facility fee will vary depending upon FedEx's senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt ratings.  For example, based upon FedEx's current ratings of BBB (Standard & Poor's) and Baa2 (Moody's Investors Service), the applicable margin for ABR Loans would be 0%, the applicable
margin for Eurodollar Loans would be 0.375%, and the facility fee is 0.125%.  In addition, at any time when the loans outstanding under the New Credit Agreement exceed 50% of the aggregate commitments, FedEx will be required to pay a utilization fee of 0.125% on such outstanding loans.
 
The New Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio of 70%, as well as customary events of default.
 
Certain of the Lenders, as well as certain of the lenders under the Terminated Agreements, and their affiliates engage in transactions with, and perform services for, FedEx and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business and have engaged, and may in the future engage, in other commercial banking transactions and investment banking, financial advisory and other financial services transactions with FedEx and its affiliates.
 
The foregoing description of the New Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the New Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).  Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.
 
A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender.

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York (or such other address designated by the Administrative Agent to Borrower pursuant to Section 9.02) and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 9.05 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.

Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
 
If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(b)
          
 
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance

with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
(d)
          
 
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or 2.15(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
(e)
          
 
.  (a)  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment would avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Loans under Section 2.11, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
 
The Borrower shall, at its sole expense and effort, have the right, by giving at least 15 Business Days' prior written notice to the affected Lender and the Administrative Agent, at any time when no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to require any Lender to assign all of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to any other Lender (other than a Conduit Lender) approved by the Borrower.

Agent in Its Individual Capacity

The plaintiffs in these lawsuits are employees of FedEx operating companies who allege, among other things, that they were forced to work "off the clock" and were not provided work breaks or other benefits. The plaintiffs generally seek unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or both. To date, one of these wage-and-hour cases, Foster v. FedEx Express, has been certified as a class action. The plaintiffs represent a class of hourly FedEx Express employees in California from October 14, 1998 to present. The plaintiffs allege that hourly employees are routinely required to work "off the clock" and are not paid for this additional work. The court issued a ruling on December 13, 2004 granting class certification on all issues.

Wage-and-Hour.
 
FedEx Ground is involved in numerous purported class-action lawsuits and other proceedings in which the threshold issue is whether some or all of FedEx Ground's owner operators are in fact employees, rather than independent contractors. Adverse determinations in these matters could, among other things, entitle certain of our contractors to the reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result in employment and withholding tax liability for FedEx Ground. We have filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation to transfer and consolidate all the class-action lawsuits for administration by a single federal court. All but one of these lawsuits has been stayed pending a ruling on our motion.

Exhibit D
The Administrative Agent
To:
         
and the Lenders who are parties to the
Credit Agreement described below
 
July 20, 2005
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am the Staff Vice President  Securities and Corporate Law and Assistant Secretary of FedEx Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ""), and have acted as such in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of July 20, 2005 among the Borrower, the Lenders named therein, the Syndication Agent named therein, the Co-Documentation Agents named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the "").  This opinion is being delivered pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.01(c) of the Agreement.  Unless the context otherwise requires, all terms used in this opinion which are specifically defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms in the Agreement; provided, that, as used in this opinion, the terms "Guarantors" and "Guarantor" only shall include the Guarantors listed on Schedule 1 attached hereto.
Borrower
Agreement
 
In connection with the opinions expressed below, I have examined the Loan Documents and the other schedules, exhibits, certificates, instruments, agreements and documents delivered in connection therewith.  I have relied upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such corporate records, documents and other instruments as in my judgment are relevant to rendering the opinions expressed below.  As to any facts material to the opinions expressed below (other than any thereof relating to the Borrower or any Guarantor), I have relied upon the representations and warranties made in the Loan Documents, the accuracy of which I have not independently investigated or verified.  In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than the signatures of the Borrower and any Guarantor) and the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies.  I also have assumed that each of the parties to the Agreement, other than the Borrower, has full power, authority and legal right to enter into the Agreement and that the Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of such parties.
 
Based upon the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
 
The Borrower is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.  The Borrower has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Agreement and perform its obligations under the Agreement and to borrow under the Agreement.  The Borrower has all corporate power required to carry on its ordinary course of business.
1
             
 
Each Significant Subsidiary and each Guarantor is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation.
2
             
 
Each of the Borrower and each Significant Subsidiary and Guarantor is duly qualified as a foreign corporation in good standing to do business in all jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify would have a Material Adverse Effect.
3
             
 
The execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by the Borrower and each of the Guarantors and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, the borrowings by the Borrower under the Agreement, and the performance by the Borrower and the Guarantors of their respective obligations under the Loan Documents, to the extent each is a party thereto, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and proceedings on the part of the Borrower and each Guarantor and do not at this time:
4
             
 
require any consent of the Borrower's or any Guarantor's shareholders;
(a)
  
 
to my knowledge, violate any present law or regulation, or any judgment, order, decree or adjudication, applicable to the Borrower or any Guarantor where such violation would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
(b)
  
 
to my knowledge, violate, result in a breach of or constitute a default under any contract, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any Guarantor and filed as a material agreement (a "") by the Borrower in an exhibit to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 (the ""), or result in the creation of any Lien on any property now owned by the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to the provisions of any Material Agreement; or
(c)
  
Material Agreement
2005 10-K
 
contravene the certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Borrower or any Guarantor.
(d)
  
 
The Loan Documents delivered as of the date hereof have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each of the Guarantors, and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors, respectively, to the extent each is a party thereto, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.
5
             
 
Neither the Borrower nor any Guarantor or Significant Subsidiary is in default or violation in any respect which would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, adjudication, determination or award presently in effect and applicable to it.
6
             
 
No approval, authorization, consent, adjudication or order of any governmental authority, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any Guarantor, is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any Guarantor in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents delivered as of the date hereof, the borrowings under the Agreement or in connection with the performance by the Borrower or any of the Guarantors of their respective obligations under the Loan Documents where the failure to obtain such approval, authorization, consent, adjudication or order would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
7
             
 
The Borrower is not an "investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as currently in effect.
8
             
 
concerning the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's liability (if any) or the effect of any adverse determination upon the business, property, financial condition or results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents), there are no actions or proceedings against the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary to which the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary is a party, pending or overtly threatened in writing, before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator which would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
I hereby confirm to you that, except as disclosed in Note 19 to the financial statements included in the Borrower's 2005 10-K (as to all of which I express no confirmation or opinion at this time
 
This opinion letter is governed by, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, the Legal Opinion Accord (1991) (the "") adopted by the Section of Business Law of the American Bar Association, which is incorporated in this opinion letter by reference.  As a consequence, it is subject to a number of qualifications, exceptions, definitions, limitations on coverage and other limitations, all as more particularly described in the Accord, and this opinion letter should be read in conjunction therewith.
Accord
 
I do not express any opinion as to matters governed by any law other than the federal laws of the United States of America, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the laws of the State of Tennessee.  To the extent that matters covered by this opinion letter involve the laws of any state other than the State of Tennessee or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, I have assumed, without independent verification of the accuracy or correctness of such assumption, that the laws of such other state which apply to the matter in question are the same as the substantive law of the State of Tennessee (but without regard to choice of law or conflicts of law principles) which would apply were such matter governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee.
 
This opinion may be relied upon by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and their respective permitted participants, assignees, and other transferees. It is understood that this opinion speaks as of the date given, notwithstanding any delivery as contemplated above on any other date.
 
Very truly yours,
 
FedEx Corporation
