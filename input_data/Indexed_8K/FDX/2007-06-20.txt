Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MEMPHIS, Tenn., June 20, 2007 ... FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) today reported earnings of $1.96 per diluted share for the fourth quarter ended May 31, compared to $1.82 per diluted share a year ago. The quarter's results include a gain from a settlement with Airbus related to the A380 order cancellation, which had a net benefit to earnings of approximately $0.06 per diluted share.
"FedEx delivered solid financial results in fiscal 2007 even though we were restrained by a slowing U.S. economy," said Frederick W. Smith, FedEx Corp. chairman, president and chief executive officer. "The weakened industrial sector is currently limiting demand for transportation services, but we expect the U.S. economy to begin to show modest year-over-year improvement in the late summer to early fall timeframe. We remain optimistic about prospects for global economic growth, and will continue to invest in projects critical to achieving strong long-term financial performance."
Fourth Quarter Results
FedEx Corp. reported the following consolidated results for the fourth quarter:
 -  Revenue of $9.15 billion, up 8% from $8.49 billion the previous year
 -  Operating income of $1.01 billion, up 9% from $927 million a year ago
 -  Operating margin of 11.1%, up from 10.9% the previous year
 -  Net income of $610 million, up 7% from last year's $568 million
Total combined average daily package volume at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground grew approximately 4% year over year for the quarter, led by continued growth in ground and international express shipments. Shipment volumes and revenues at FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight were lower than anticipated in the fourth quarter due to the softer economy.
 
Full Year Results
FedEx Corp. reported the following consolidated results for the full year:
 -  Revenue of $35.2 billion, up 9% from $32.3 billion the previous year
 -  Operating income of $3.28 billion, up 9% from $3.01 billion a year ago
 -  Operating margin of 9.3%, unchanged from 9.3% the previous year
 -  Net income of $2.02 billion, up 12% from last year's $1.81 billion
 -  Earnings per share of $6.48, up 11% from $5.83 per share a year ago
Revenue grew due to strong FedEx Ground volume growth, as well as continued FedEx Express International Priority revenue growth. Revenue growth also reflected the acquisition of Watkins Motor Lines in September 2006. Fiscal 2007 results included costs associated with upfront compensation and benefits under the new pilot labor contract at FedEx Express, which reduced second quarter earnings by approximately $0.25 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006 results included a charge of $0.15 per diluted share to adjust the accounting for certain facility leases, primarily at FedEx Express. Capital spending for fiscal 2007 was $2.9 billion.
Outlook
FedEx expects earnings to be $1.45 to $1.60 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and $7.00 to $7.40 per diluted share for the full year, assuming an improvement in the U.S. economy beginning in the late summer or early fall. Earnings growth is expected to be below the company's long-term 10% to 15% earnings growth target due to continued soft economic growth and to planned investments to expand the company's networks and broaden its service offerings. Capital spending for fiscal 2008 is forecast to be approximately $3.5 billion, of which approximately 70% is targeted for growth.
"We are making significant investments in our global networks," said Alan B. Graf, Jr., FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. "Our investments are targeted to programs and services that will drive long-term earnings growth, improve service quality to our customers and increase productivity. We remain highly focused on our long-term financial goals of improving earnings, margins, operating cash flows and returns for our shareowners."
 
FedEx Express Segment
For the fourth quarter, the FedEx Express segment reported:
 -  Revenue of $5.83 billion, up 4% from last year's $5.61 billion
 -  Operating income of $595 million, up 6% from $560 million a year ago
 -  Operating margin of 10.2%, up from 10.0% the previous year
FedEx International Priority (IP) revenue grew 7% for the quarter, as IP revenue per package grew 4%, primarily due to favorable exchange rates, higher weights and higher rates per pound, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. IP average daily package volume grew 3%, reflecting lower volume growth from Europe and Latin America. U.S. domestic revenue per package decreased slightly, as lower fuel surcharges and a shift to lower-yielding services offset increases in rate per pound. U.S. domestic average daily package volume declined 1%. Revenue growth also reflected the acquisition of ANC Holdings Ltd.
Operating margin improved, with cost controls and the benefit from the Airbus A380 settlement offsetting the effects of the softening global economy and the net impact of fuel.
In China, FedEx Express began offering next-business-day domestic express service on May 28, 2007. The new domestic service provides China's burgeoning market with next-business-day, time-definite delivery backed by a money-back guarantee to 19 cities and day-definite delivery to more than 200 cities throughout the country. The startup of domestic service in China negatively affected results in the quarter, and will continue to negatively impact earnings throughout fiscal 2008.
 
FedEx Ground Segment
For the fourth quarter, the FedEx Ground segment reported:
 -  Revenue of $1.58 billion, up 12% from last year's $1.42 billion
 -  Operating income of $269 million, up 30% from $207 million a year ago
 -  Operating margin of 17.0%, up from 14.6% the previous year
FedEx Ground average daily package volume grew 8% year over year in the fourth quarter due to increased commercial business and the continued strong growth of its FedEx Home Delivery service. Yield improved 4% primarily due to the impact of rate increases, including dimensional weight charges, and extra service revenues.
Operating margin was higher due to lower legal costs, better results at FedEx SmartPost and improved productivity.
FedEx Freight Segment
For the fourth quarter, the FedEx Freight segment reported:
 -  Revenue of $1.25 billion, up 28% from last year's $973 million
 -  Operating income of $125 million, down 12% from $142 million a year ago
 -  Operating margin of 10.0%, down from 14.6% the previous year
Less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments increased 16% year over year due to the acquisition of Watkins (now rebranded as FedEx National LTL). Excluding FedEx National LTL, average daily LTL shipments at FedEx Freight regional were down slightly year over year, as the slower economy continued to negatively impact demand. LTL yield improved 11% year over year, reflecting higher yields from longer-haul FedEx National LTL shipments, higher rates and favorable contract renewals. A general rate increase was implemented effective April 2, 2007.
Operating margins declined primarily due to operating losses at FedEx National LTL, which resulted from softening volumes and ongoing expenses to integrate its network.
 
FedEx Kinko's Segment
For the fourth quarter, the FedEx Kinko's segment reported:
 -  Revenue of $532 million, down 2% from last year's $542 million
 -  Operating income of $23 million, up 28% from $18 million a year ago
 -  Operating margin of 4.3%, up from 3.3% the previous year
The FedEx Kinko's revenue decrease for the quarter was primarily due to declines in copy product revenues, which more than offset higher package acceptance fees paid by FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. Operating margin benefited from higher package acceptance revenues.
FedEx Kinko's continues to invest in a multi-year plan to open new locations, improve core services and enhance its integrated digital document service network, supporting the company's objective of being the back office for local businesses and the remote office for traveling professionals. The company opened 226 centers in fiscal 2007 and plans to open approximately 300 new centers in fiscal 2008.
Tax Rate
The company's effective tax rate was approximately 38.5% for the fourth quarter and 37.3% for the full year. During the quarter, tax charges were incurred as a result of a reorganization in Asia associated with the company's acquisition in China. For fiscal 2008, the effective tax rate is expected to be between 37.5% and 38.0%.
