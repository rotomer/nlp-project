Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MEMPHIS, Tenn., September 20, 2007 ... FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) today reported earnings of $1.58 per diluted share for the first quarter ended August 31, compared to $1.53 per diluted share a year ago.
"FedEx increased its revenue and earnings against the backdrop of a sluggish U.S. economy," said Frederick W. Smith, FedEx Corp. chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Outside of the United States, the economy is generally solid, contributing to the growth in our international express shipments. I continue to believe that FedEx will, over the long-term, reap the rewards of our strategy of investing in key growth markets and strengthening and expanding our worldwide networks."
First Quarter Results
FedEx Corp. reported the following consolidated results for the first quarter:
While operating margin improved in the FedEx Express and FedEx Ground segments, consolidated margin declined due to a lower margin year over year at FedEx Freight and to network investments to increase capacity, improve service quality and increase productivity.
 
Total combined average daily package volume in the FedEx Express and FedEx Ground segments grew 8% year over year for the quarter, due to growth in ground and international express shipments. The increase in international domestic express shipments resulted primarily from recent international acquisitions.
Outlook
FedEx expects earnings to be $1.60 to $1.75 per diluted share in the second quarter compared to $1.64 a year ago. Last year's second quarter results included $0.25 per diluted share net impact of costs associated with the new pilot labor contract, mostly offset by the benefits from the timing of net fuel impacts and Hurricane Katrina insurance proceeds. For the full year, the company now expects earnings of $6.70 to $7.10 per diluted share. The capital spending forecast is $3.5 billion, of which approximately 70% is targeted for growth. However, management is reviewing the timing of capital outlays, which could result in lower spending for the year.
"While the U.S. economy is growing at a moderate pace, recent financial market volatility and high energy costs have increased the uncertainty surrounding the near-term economic outlook, and weakness in the housing sector continues," said Alan B. Graf, Jr., FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. "As a result of this weaker than anticipated economic environment, particularly its impact on the LTL freight market, we have reduced our earnings forecast by four percent for the full year."
Reporting Changes
In order to better coordinate and leverage strategies and resources, FedEx Kinko's has been realigned to report to FedEx Services, which has overall responsibility for sales, marketing and customer-facing information technology. Under FedEx Services, FedEx Kinko's will benefit from the full range of resources and expertise of FedEx Services to continue to enhance the customer experience. The company will pursue synergies in sales, marketing, information technology and administrative areas to improve the ability of FedEx to bundle transportation and business services and drive additional revenue through the FedEx Kinko's retail network.
 
With this realignment, the FedEx Corp. reportable segments have been revised to include the three existing transportation segments and a new FedEx Services segment. The new segment includes FedEx Services, FedEx Kinko's, FedEx Global Supply Chain Services and FedEx Customer Information Services. The net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment are allocated to the transportation segments they support.
Also, beginning this quarter the company is expanding its operating statistics disclosures. FedEx Express is now disclosing volume and yield information for international domestic shipments. These are shipments where the origin and destination are both within the same non-U.S. country, including the United Kingdom, Canada, China and India. FedEx Ground is now disclosing volume and yield information for FedEx SmartPost. FedEx SmartPost specializes in the consolidation and delivery of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages, using the U.S. Postal Service for the final delivery to residences.
FedEx Express Segment
For the first quarter, the FedEx Express segment reported:
FedEx International Priority (IP) package revenue grew 9% for the quarter, as IP revenue per package improved 3%, primarily due to favorable exchange rates and higher weight per package, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. IP average daily package volume grew 6%. U.S. domestic package volume and revenue declined 1%, reflecting the continued impact of the challenging U.S. economy, lower fuel surcharges and a customer shift to lower-yielding services. International domestic volume and revenue growth resulted from recent international acquisitions.
Operating income and margin improved due to international revenue growth and effective cost controls, although continued investment in domestic express services in China negatively impacted this quarter's results.
 
FedEx Ground Segment
For the first quarter, the FedEx Ground segment reported:
FedEx Ground average daily package volume grew 10% year over year in the first quarter due to increased commercial business and the continued strong growth of its FedEx Home Delivery service. Yield improved 4% primarily due to the impact of rate increases, including dimensional weight charges, and extra service revenues.
Operating margin was higher due to revenue growth, improved productivity and effective cost controls, offset in part by investments to expand capacity and higher legal costs.
As part of its ongoing effort to strengthen its independent contractor network, FedEx Ground is investing in a new nationwide program which provides greater incentives to certain of its 15,000 contractors who choose to grow their businesses by adding routes. Also, in response to current regulatory and legal uncertainty in California, FedEx Ground is offering special incentives to encourage California-based single-route contractors to transform their operations into multiple-route businesses or sell their routes to others. The multiple-route business owners in California are being offered additional incentives to grow their businesses by acquiring available routes. The costs of the nationwide and California programs are not expected to be material.
FedEx Freight Segment
For the first quarter, the FedEx Freight segment reported:
 
Less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments increased 13% year over year due to the acquisition of Watkins (now rebranded as FedEx National LTL), partially offset by lower average daily shipments at FedEx Freight regional. FedEx Freight regional shipments declined slightly, as demand has been restrained by the slower U.S. economy. Effective July 23, 2007, FedEx Freight reduced its standard regional LTL fuel surcharge by 25% and FedEx National LTL revised its standard LTL fuel surcharge to levels commensurate with FedEx Freight. Despite the fuel surcharge reduction, LTL yield improved 8% year over year reflecting higher yields from longer-haul FedEx National LTL shipments.
Operating margins declined during the quarter due to operating losses at FedEx National LTL and lower year over year growth in regional yield, including the impact from the fuel surcharge reduction. While the LTL fuel surcharge reduction is expected to have a negative impact on revenue and earnings for the remainder of the fiscal year, this change is expected to strengthen FedEx Freight competitively and drive incremental volumes over the long-term.
FedEx Services Segment
FedEx Services segment revenue, which includes the operations of FedEx Kinko's and FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, was flat year over year. Copy product revenues declined at FedEx Kinko's, more than offsetting higher package acceptance fees and revenue generated from new locations.
FedEx Kinko's continues to invest in a multi-year plan to open new locations, improve core services and enhance its integrated digital document service network, supporting the company's objective of being the back office for local businesses and the remote office for traveling professionals. The company opened 90 centers during the first quarter.
