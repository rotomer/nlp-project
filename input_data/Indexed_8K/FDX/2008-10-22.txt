SECTION 8  OTHER EVENTS
On October 22, 2008, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") withdrew its tentative assessment of tax and penalties for the 2002 calendar year ($319 million plus interest) against FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ("FedEx Ground"), a wholly owned subsidiary of FedEx Corporation, relating to the classification of FedEx Ground's owner-operators for federal employment tax purposes. The IRS is continuing its employment tax audit of FedEx Ground for the 2002 calendar year. We are engaged in discussions with the IRS audit team regarding this matter. We continue to believe that FedEx Ground's owner-operators are independent contractors and that no loss is probable in this matter.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
FedEx Corporation
