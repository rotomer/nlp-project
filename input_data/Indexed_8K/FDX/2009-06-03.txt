SECTION 2  FINANCIAL INFORMATION
On May 29, 2009, FedEx Corporation management concluded that a noncash charge of approximately $900 million ($885 million, net of tax) for impairment of the value of goodwill would need to be recorded in the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2009  $810 million related to reduction of the value of the goodwill recorded as a result of the February 2004 acquisition of Kinkos, Inc. (now known as FedEx Office), and $90 million related to reduction of the value of the goodwill recorded as a result of the September 2006 acquisition of the U.S. and Canadian less-than-truckload freight operations of Watkins Motor Lines and certain affiliates (now known as FedEx National LTL).
The conclusion was made in connection with FedExs annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets conducted in the fourth quarter in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements to be included in FedExs annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009. The key factor contributing to the goodwill impairment was a decline in FedEx Offices and FedEx National LTLs recent and forecasted financial performance as a result of weak economic conditions. FedEx does not expect to be required to make any current or future cash expenditures as a result of these impairments.
Total charges for the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2009 are expected to approximate $1.2 billion. This includes the goodwill impairments discussed above, previously disclosed aircraft-related asset impairments, an immaterial amount of additional aircraft-related charges and other charges primarily associated with employee severance and facility reduction costs. Substantially all of these charges (approximately $1.1 billion) are noncash.
