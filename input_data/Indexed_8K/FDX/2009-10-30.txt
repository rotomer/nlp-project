SECTION 8  OTHER EVENTS
On October 30, 2009, the Internal Revenue Services audit team (Audit Team) provided us with a revised notice of proposed adjustment with respect to their employment tax audit for the 2002 calendar year regarding the classification of independent contractors at FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (FedEx Ground), a wholly owned subsidiary of FedEx Corporation. The Audit Team has now proposed that no assessment of federal employment tax be made with respect to any of FedEx Grounds independent contractors, including those providing the FedEx Home Delivery service.
While similar issues are still under audit for calendar years 2004 through 2008, we believe the Audit Team should reach the same conclusion on these issues for each of those years, as well.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
FedEx Corporation
