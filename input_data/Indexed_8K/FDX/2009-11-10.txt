SECTION 8  OTHER EVENTS
On November 9, 2009, the Internal Revenue Services audit team (Audit Team) confirmed that no assessment of federal employment tax would be made with respect to any independent contractors at FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of FedEx Corporation) not only for calendar year 2002, as previously disclosed, but also for the next three calendar years that had been under audit: 2004 through 2006. While similar issues may be audited for calendar years 2007 and 2008, we believe the Audit Team should reach the same conclusion on these issues for each of those years, as well.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
FedEx Corporation
