Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MEMPHIS, Tenn., December 15, 2011 ... FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) today reported earnings of $1.57 per diluted share for the second quarter ended November 30. Last year's second quarter earnings were $0.89 per diluted share, which included $0.27 per diluted share in costs related to the combination of the company's FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations and a reserve associated with a legal matter at FedEx Express. Excluding those one-time charges, earnings were $1.16 per diluted share a year ago.
"Our improved performance was largely a result of effective yield management programs and strong demand for FedEx Home Delivery and FedEx SmartPost services," said Frederick W. Smith, FedEx Corp. chairman, president and chief executive officer. "With the healthy growth in online shopping this holiday season, demand is increasing for these residential delivery services."
In order to continue the modernization of the company's aircraft fleet, FedEx Express has signed an agreement with The Boeing Company to purchase 27 new 767-300F aircraft, with three arriving in fiscal 2014 and six per year in fiscal 2015-2018. The 767s were selected as the best choice to begin replacing FedEx Express's MD10 aircraft, some of which are more than 40 years old. The 767s will provide similar capacity as the MD10s, with improved reliability, an approximate 30% increase in fuel efficiency and a minimum of a 20% reduction in unit operating costs.
FedEx Express is also delaying the delivery of 11 777F aircraft, two of which will be deferred from fiscal 2013, five from fiscal 2014 and one per year in fiscal 2015-2018, to better balance air network capacity to demand. As a result of these deferrals, FedEx Express will place into service four 777s in fiscal 2013 and two in fiscal 2014. The company is also exercising two 777 options for aircraft to be delivered at the end of the delivery schedule.
 
"FedEx Express took action during the quarter to adjust its network, particularly in Asia, as recent inventory destocking trends have impacted demand for our FedEx Express services," said Alan B. Graf, Jr., FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. "The deferral of our 777 aircraft deliveries is a continuation of those efforts, enabling us to make appropriately-timed international 777 capacity additions over the next decade. With these actions, we expect fiscal 2013 capital expenditures to moderate to approximately $3.8 billion."
Second Quarter Results
FedEx Corp. reported the following consolidated results for the second quarter:
Operating results improved due to the continued strong performance of FedEx Ground driven by higher yields and volumes, as well as a significant improvement in profitability at FedEx Freight. The results for the quarter also reflect the positive year-over-year impact, predominately at FedEx Express, of a benefit from the timing lag that exists between when fuel prices change and when indexed fuel surcharges automatically adjust. Last year's operating income and margin were impacted by one-time charges at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight.
Outlook
FedEx projects earnings to be $1.25 to $1.45 per diluted share in the third quarter and reconfirms its forecast of $6.25 to $6.75 per diluted share for fiscal 2012. This guidance assumes the current market outlook for fuel prices, normal winter weather and moderate growth in the global economy. The company reported earnings of $0.73 per diluted share in last year's third quarter, which included one-time FedEx Freight combination costs of $0.08 per diluted share. The capital spending forecast for fiscal 2012 remains $4.2 billion.
 
FedEx Express Segment
For the second quarter, the FedEx Express segment reported:
U.S. domestic revenue per package grew 12% due to higher fuel surcharges and rate per pound, while average daily package volume declined 4%. FedEx International Priority (IP) revenue per package grew 11% due to higher fuel surcharges, rate per pound and weight per package. IP average daily package volume decreased 3% driven by declines from Asia. IP freight pounds increased 4% with revenue per pound up 4% due to higher fuel surcharges. In total, IP package and freight pounds increased 2% and revenue increased 8% year-over-year.
Operating income and margin improved in the quarter, reflecting the year-over-year benefit of the fuel surcharge timing lag. Prior year results were negatively impacted by a $66 million reserve associated with a legal matter.
FedEx Ground Segment
For the second quarter, the FedEx Ground segment reported:
FedEx Ground average daily package volume grew 4% in the second quarter driven by increases in FedEx Home Delivery services, as well as the business-to-business market. Revenue per package increased 8% primarily due to increased rates and higher fuel surcharges. FedEx SmartPost average daily volume increased 17% primarily due to growth in e-commerce. FedEx SmartPost revenue per package increased 4% primarily due to increased fuel surcharges.
Operating income and margin increased primarily due to increased revenue per package and volume growth.
 
Earlier this month, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery announced that shipping rates will be increased by a net average of 4.9% effective January 2, 2012. The full average rate increase of 5.9% will be partially offset by adjusting the fuel price threshold at which the fuel surcharge begins, reducing the fuel surcharge by one percentage point. FedEx SmartPost rates will also increase.
FedEx Freight Segment
For the second quarter, the FedEx Freight segment reported:
Less-than-truckload (LTL) yield increased 8% primarily due to higher LTL fuel surcharges and ongoing yield management actions, which reduced LTL average daily shipments by 3%. FedEx Freight implemented a 6.75% general rate increase on September 6, 2011.
Operating income in the quarter was driven by strong yield growth and ongoing efficiency improvement resulting from the January 30, 2011 combination of the FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations. The operating loss in the prior year largely resulted from $86 million of one-time costs associated with the LTL network combination.

The company believes that meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the likelihood that particular factors will repeat. Excluding a reserve associated with a legal matter at FedEx Express and the costs of the combination of FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations from our prior period second quarter earnings, net of applicable incentive compensation impacts, will allow for more accurate comparisons of our second quarter operating performance. As required by SEC rules, the table below presents a reconciliation of our presented non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
