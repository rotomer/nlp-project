SECTION 1. REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS
Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Agreement.
On June 29, 2012, FedEx Corporation's wholly owned subsidiary Federal Express Corporation ("FedEx Express") and The Boeing Company ("Boeing") entered into Supplemental Agreement No. 1 (and related side letters) (the "Supplemental Agreement") to Purchase Agreement Number 3712 dated as of December 14, 2011 between Boeing and FedEx Express related to Boeing 767-300 Freighter (B767F) aircraft (the "Boeing Purchase Agreement").
In the Supplemental Agreement, FedEx Express agreed to purchase nine additional B767F aircraft from Boeing. Additionally, FedEx Express exercised ten B767F options available under the Boeing Purchase Agreement and purchased the right to 15 additional options. Four of these 19 additional B767F aircraft purchases are conditioned upon there being no event that causes FedEx Express or its employees not to be covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended ("RLA"). These 19 additional B767F aircraft are expected to be delivered from fiscal 2015 to 2019 and will replace current MD10-10 and Airbus A310-200 aircraft to continue to improve efficiency and technology of FedEx Express's aircraft fleet. A copy of the Supplemental Agreement will be filed as an exhibit to FedEx's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending August 31, 2012.
In conjunction with the additional B767F aircraft purchases, FedEx Express and Boeing agreed to convert four currently contracted Boeing 777-Freighter (B777F) aircraft deliveries that were subject to the RLA condition  two scheduled for delivery in fiscal 2016 and two scheduled for delivery in fiscal 2017  to equivalent purchase value for B767F aircraft under the Supplemental Agreement.
