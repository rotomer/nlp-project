Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure On January 16, 2003, FirstEnergy Corp. (Company) updated the investment community on activities associated with efforts to prepare the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station for a safe and reliable return to service and other matters. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) IMC 0350 Restart Process - January 14, 2003 - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Public Meeting - -------------- The NRC's IMC 0350 Oversight Panel held its monthly public meeting on the Davis-Besse restoration efforts in Port Clinton, Ohio on January 14, 2003. The NRC indicated that a transcript of the meeting would be available on the NRC's Internet Web site in approximately three weeks. The NRC provided updates on the Davis-Besse restart checklist, the status of ongoing NRC inspection activity, and plans for upcoming public meetings. FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) officials discussed progress being made toward plant restart including preparations for fuel reload, progress on the bulk work and key systems upgrades, and improvements implemented in various operational programs. Ongoing NRC inspections are currently focused on: Organizational Effectiveness and Human Performance including observations of day-to-day activities, and other important building blocks such as Program Effectiveness and Systems Health. With respect to the Organizational Effectiveness and Human Performance Inspection, the NRC commented that they had completed their evaluation of FirstEnergy's root cause analysis and the inspection's focus will now shift toward the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's corrective actions to create a more safety-focused work environment. The NRC also announced that a public meeting has been scheduled for January 30, 2003, in the NRC's Region III office in Lisle, Illinois to specifically address the Company's evaluation of safety culture issues among plant management and staff, and its programs to address those issues. The NRC commented that they were confident that the plant's senior management had the proper safety culture, but they need to verify that the culture exists throughout the organization. Program Effectiveness inspections are reviewing progress on the Company's implementation of more effective programs. These include the Corrective Action Program, the Boric Acid Control Program, the In-Service Inspection Program, and the Radiation Protection Program. The presentations by FENOC officials covered various restart activities including: o A recently installed permanent seal plate on the reactor vessel which provides a tighter seal and improves efficiency during refueling outages. o Progress on the design modification of the containment emergency sump strainers. The sump is a collection point for water that would be recirculated for reactor cooling in the event of a loss-of-coolant accident. This change, while not required by the NRC, was initiated by FENOC to substantially increase the strainers' surface area and thus, increase the plant's design safety margin. o Improvements made to the Corrective Action Program and the Reactor Coolant System Integrity Management Program. o Initiation of the first Restart Readiness Review meeting which was convened to validate our readiness for fuel reload (Mode 6 of Operation). The formal Restart Readiness Review process, which involves all responsible managers for restart work, is a detailed conservative assessment undertaken before loading fuel. This process will also be used at each step of plant startup. o Actions taken and programs being implemented to ensure the proper safety culture and a safety-conscious work environment, two critical elements in the Management and Human Performance 1
Building Block. The Company has contracted the services of Dr. Sonja Haber of Performance Safety and Health Associates to assist in the development of a methodology to assess the safety culture of the work force. Dr. Haber has significant experience in this field having previously worked with the NRC, the Department of Energy, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. While recognizing that the restart of Davis-Besse requires NRC approval, the Company's integrated schedule currently supports restart in the March/April, 2003 timeframe. Critical path activities include: o January: Fuel reload toward month-end. o February: Installation of the reactor head, completion of the emergency sump strainer design modification, and completion of the integrated leak rate test of containment. o March: Completion of the seven-day pressure test of the reactor coolant system test, inspection of the under vessel penetration nozzles, and testing of all plant systems in preparation for restart.
