Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Statements and Exhibits (c) Exhibits. Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release issued by FirstEnergy Corp., dated April 30, 2003 99.2 Consolidated Report to the Financial Community, dated April 30, 2003 Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits listed above, is being furnished, not filed, under Item 9 pursuant to Regulation FD and Item 12, "Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in accordance with SEC Release Nos. 33-8216 and 34-47583. The information in this report and in such exhibits shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed pursuit to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On April 30, 2003, FirstEnergy Corp. issued two public announcements, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference. FirstEnergy's Consolidated Report to the Financial Community contains non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Consolidated Report to the Financial Community of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The Consolidated Report to the Financial Community includes normalized earnings per share, which is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "unusual or one-time items". Unusual items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are not routine, are related to prior periods, are related to discontinued businesses or the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Management believes presenting normalized earnings calculated in this manner provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of FirstEnergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. FirstEnergy's management frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies. The non-GAAP information presented in the Consolidated Report to the Financial Community should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, reported earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. This Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements based on information currently available to management. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms "anticipate," "potential," "expect," "believe," "estimate" and similar words. Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for energy services, changing energy market prices, legislative and regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), availability and cost of capital, inability to accomplish or realize anticipated benefits of strategic goals and other similar factors. 1 SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

2 Exhibit 99.1 FirstEnergy Corp. For Release: April 30, 2003 76 South Main Street Akron, Ohio 44308 www.firstenergycorp.com News Media Contact: Investor Contact: Kristen Baird Kurt Turosky (330) 761-4261 (330) 384-5500 FIRSTENERGY REPORTS HIGHER FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS; UPDATES DAVIS-BESSE SCHEDULE FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today reported first quarter 2003 net income of $138.8 million, or basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.47, before the cumulative effect of an accounting change resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard for asset retirement obligations. After the accounting change, first quarter net income was $241.0 million, or basic and diluted earnings of $0.82 per share. These results compare with net income for the first quarter of 2002 of $116.5 million, or basic and diluted earnings of $0.40 per share. Contributions to FirstEnergy's 2003 first quarter earnings growth include a 9.4 percent increase in electric distribution deliveries; improved natural gas margins due to reduced sourcing costs; lower financing costs associated with debt-reduction and refinancing activities; and the absence of unusual charges that reduced earnings by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2002. Earnings growth was partially offset by several items, including $88 million, or $0.18 per share, in additional expenses associated with the extended outage at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station and efforts to prepare the plant for restart ($52 million for replacement power costs and $36 million of incremental operating and maintenance expenses). The increase in first quarter earnings also was partially offset by a $50-million increase in pension and other employee benefit costs. Total revenues for the first quarter of 2003 were $3.2 billion, compared with $2.9 billion during the same period in 2002. For the quarter, total generation kilowatt-hour sales rose 30.6 percent, reflecting both retail and wholesale transactions. (more)
FirstEnergy continued making progress in its effort to improve its financial flexibility through debt reduction and refinancing. During the quarter, the company retired, refinanced or repriced long-term debt totaling $685 million, which will produce approximately $20 million in annual savings. With respect to the schedule for Davis-Besse's return to service, the FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company now expects the plant to be ready for restart in the first half of the summer, rather than this spring. The revised timeline reflects work associated with the reactor vessel pressure test, as well as other physical work required for restart. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will make the final determination of when the plant can return to service.

Exhibit 99.2 Consolidated Report to the Financial Community (Unaudited) - ----------------------------------- 1Q 2003 Results Compared With 1Q 2002 - ------------------------------------- o Electric distribution deliveries increased 9%, largely driven by a 15% rise in residential deliveries, reflecting colder weather. Commercial deliveries increased 12%, while industrial deliveries only increased slightly. Total electric generation sales increased 31%. Approximately 75% of the increase was attributable to higher wholesale sales and 25% attributable to higher retail sales. o Electric gross margin increased $113 million after adjusting for changes in regulatory deferrals and Davis-Besse replacement power costs. Excluding these adjustments, electric sales revenue increased $390 million, due largely to an increase in wholesale spot sales and Basic Generation Service sales in New Jersey. Purchased power costs increased $290 million, after adjusting for regulatory deferrals and $52 million of Davis-Besse replacement power costs. Fuel expenses decreased $13 million due to lower generation output. o Natural gas gross margin rose $21 million, primarily due to reduced sourcing costs for our gas marketing business. o International operations net income decreased $12 million primarily as a result of the earnings reflected last year, when we owned 100% of Avon Energy Partners Holdings. o Pension and other employee benefit costs increased $50 million, principally reflecting reduced asset values, reduced return assumptions on trust assets, and lower discount rates used to value projected obligations. 1
o Total depreciation and amortization expenses increased $19 million. The increase is primarily attributable to a $29 million increase in Ohio transition costs amortization and $10 million of depreciation expense associated with the Lake Plants in 2003. These expenses were partially offset by $18 million of lower nuclear decommissioning and depreciation expenses related to SFAS No. 143 implementation. o Excluding international operations, net interest charges decreased $47 million as a result of our aggressive debt reduction program and refinancing initiatives. Financing activities during the quarter included $122 million in mandatory long-term debt redemptions, $563 million of refinancings, and $50 million in incremental long-term debt issuance. 2003 Earnings Impact Associated with Davis-Besse - ------------------------------------------------ o Incremental expenses associated with the extended outage at Davis-Besse during the quarter totaled $88 million, or $0.18 per share ($52 million of replacement power costs and $36 million of O&M expenses).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's Ratings Actions - --------------------------------------------------- On April 14, S&P Ratings Services affirmed its 'BBB' corporate credit rating on FirstEnergy Corp. and its subsidiaries. S&P also upgraded FirstEnergy's Business Position rating from '6' to '5.' In addition, on April 11, Moody's Investors Service affirmed its 'Baa2' issuer and senior unsecured ratings for FirstEnergy Corp. Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station - --------------------------------- FirstEnergy continues to make progress toward returning Davis-Besse to safe and reliable operation. Milestones achieved included modification of the Containment Emergency Sump, installation of a FLUS leak detection system on the bottom of the reactor vessel, and successful completion of the Integrated Leak Rate Test on the containment building. Additionally, the Company's consultant, Dr. Sonja Haber, has completed the safety culture assessment report, which will be discussed at a future NRC meeting. The next milestone will be the pressure test of the reactor coolant system, including the reactor vessel. Nuclear Plant Refueling Outages - ------------------------------- Beaver Valley Unit 1 completed its refueling outage and returned to service on April 29. During the refueling, repairs were made to minor surface cracks on four of the 65 control rod drive mechanism nozzles. The cracks did not result in coolant leakage and inspection of the reactor head indicated it is in good condition. The Perry Plant began its refueling outage on April 5 and is expected to return to service in early May. Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L) Rate Case - ---------------------------------------------- The schedule in the JCP&L rate case has been revised as follows: o Hearings completed on o Administrative Law Judge Recommended Decision April 28 due end of June o Briefs are due May 2 o Board of Public Utilities decision expected in July o Reply Briefs are due May 16 o New rates will be effective August 1 Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC) Activity - ------------------------------------------------------- Following the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's denial of appeals of the Commonwealth Court's Order on the merger settlement and Provider of Last Resort rate relief, the PAPUC: o transmitted the issue of merger savings to the Office of Administrative Law Judge for hearings, o directed Met-Ed and Penelec to file a position paper by May 2 describing the status of a settlement stipulation in light of the Commonwealth Court's opinion; and o directed all interested parties to submit responses within 30 days of the Companies' position paper filing Shelf Registration - ------------------ On March 17, FirstEnergy filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission covering securities in the aggregate of up to $2 billion. Although the Company does not have any current plans to issue securities, the shelf provides the flexibility to issue and sell various types of securities, including common stock, debt securities, or share purchase contracts and related share purchase units. Emdersa Abandonment - ------------------- On April 18, FirstEnergy divested its ownership in the Argentine distribution company Emdersa through the abandonment of its shares in Emdersa's parent company, GPU Argentina Holdings, Inc. FirstEnergy will recognize a one-time, non-cash charge of $63 million in the second quarter ($0.21 per share). Since FirstEnergy had recorded a $90 million currency translation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2002, the net effect of the $63 million charge will be an increase in common shareholders' equity of $27 million. FirstEnergy anticipates income tax benefits of $129 million related to the abandonment, which will be reflected in earnings in a future period.
