Employer File Number Address; and Telephone Number Identification No. - ----------- ----------------------------- ------------------ 333-21011 FIRSTENERGY CORP. 34-1843785 (An Ohio Corporation) 76 South Main Street Akron, Ohio 44308 Telephone 800-736-3402
Item 5. Other Events On May 9, 2003, FirstEnergy Corp. (Company) amended its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company recorded a net charge to income during the year ended December 31, 2002, of $57.1 million (net of income taxes of $13.6 million) relating to decisions to retain interests in two businesses previously classified as "Assets Pending Sale": Avon Energy Partners Holdings (Avon) and GPU Empresa Distribuidora Electrica Regional S.A. and affiliates (Emdersa). This net charge represents the aggregate results of operations of Avon and Emdersa for the respective periods these businesses were held for sale. This charge was previously reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2002, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting. In April 2003, it was determined that this charge should instead have been classified in operations. The amended Form 10-K reflects this change on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2002. This change in classification had no effect on previously reported net income. 1
