Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure On June 5, 2003, FirstEnergy Corp. updated the investment community on activities associated with efforts to return the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station to service in a safe and reliable manner. NRC IMC 0350 Restart Process - June 3, 2003, Meeting - ---------------------------------------------------- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) IMC 0350 Panel conducted its monthly status session on the Davis-Besse restart effort at Camp Perry, near Port Clinton, Ohio on June 3, 2003. The meeting included an update on recent NRC activities, as well as an update by FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) officials on its progress toward preparing the plant for restart. The NRC discussed significant activities since the May 6, 2003 public meeting. The activities included issuance of the final significance for red finding regarding the control rod drive mechanism penetration cracking and reactor pressure vessel head degradation. The NRC oversight panel had determined that FENOC has adequately completed 11 of the 29 actions included in the restart checklist. The items completed in the past month include: o Boric acid corrosion management program (item 3d); o Reactor coolant system unidentified leakage monitoring program (item 3e); o In-service inspection programs (item 3f); and o Modification control program (item 3g). The NRC also discussed its continuing inspection efforts at the plant, including system health reviews and design issues, safety culture/safety conscious work environment, corrective action team inspection, and resident inspection. Upcoming NRC activities include preparing for the under-vessel inspections. The NRC also mentioned that a third resident inspector will join the team effective September 2003. FENOC officials' provided an update on plant activities, progress on management and human performance issues since the last meeting, modification of the high-pressure injection pumps, quality oversight and several engineering design issues. FENOC reported that it successfully completed two preliminary pressure tests of its reactor coolant system (RCS) during May. The two pressure tests, one increasing RCS pressure to 50 pounds per-square-inch (psi) and the other to 250 psi, were conducted to identify and subsequently rectify any valves needing minor repair. These steps help pave the way for the important full-pressure test (2,155 psi), slated for mid-to-late July 2003. With respect to management and human performance issues, FENOC provided actions taken to-date to address such issues and discussed site alignment and leadership plans going forward. The presentation also included an update on FENOC's decision to modify the high pressure injection (HPI) pumps. The pumps will be modified to add an internal strainer to prevent debris from entering the hydrostatic bearing. The ports that supply water to the hydrostatic bearing will be relocated to reduce debris concentration at the strainer. The current schedule shows completion of the pump modification by mid-July 2003. The NRC has scheduled the following Davis-Besse meetings: o June 19 - Discuss modification of the HPI pumps (Rockville, Maryland) o July 9 - Next 0350 panel meeting (Oak Harbor High School, Oak Harbor, Ohio) 1
