Item 5. Other Events Reference is made to Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters - Air Regulation in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 of Ohio Edison Company and Pennsylvania Power Company, wholly owned subsidiaries of FirstEnergy Corp., with respect to a complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the W.H. Sammis Plant. On Thursday, August 7, 2003, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ruled that 11 projects undertaken at the W. H. Sammis Plant between 1984 and 1998 required pre-construction permits under the Clean Air Act. The ruling concludes the liability phase of the case, which deals with applicability of Prevention of Significant Deterioration provisions of the Clean Air Act. The remedy phase, which is currently scheduled to be heard beginning March 15, 2004, will address civil penalties and what, if any, actions should be taken to further reduce emissions at the Plant. In the ruling, the Court indicated that the remedies it "may consider and impose involved a much broader, equitable analysis, requiring the Court to consider air quality, public health, economic impact, and employment consequences. The Court may also consider the less than consistent efforts of the EPA to apply and further enforce the Clean Air Act." SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
