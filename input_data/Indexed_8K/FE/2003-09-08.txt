Item 5. Other Events On September 8, 2003, FirstEnergy Corp. announced the public offering of additional common stock. FirstEnergy is updating its 2003 earnings guidance to reflect issuance of the additional shares, as outlined on Exhibit 99 herein. In connection with the offering, FirstEnergy is making presentations which contain a non-GAAP financial measure - free cash flow. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided below a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 2003 ($ in millions) Estimate ------------------------------------------------------------------ Cash flows from operations (GAAP basis) ............... $1,829 Less: Capital expenditures ............................... (733) Nuclear fuel fabrication ........................... (146) Common stock dividends ............................. (451) Add: Cash from divestitures of non-core assets .......... 76 Free cash flow (non-GAAP basis) ....................... $ 575 Management believes presenting free cash flow (non-GAAP basis) provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing cash flows of FirstEnergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's liquidity to others in the energy sector. FirstEnergy's management frequently references non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons, as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies. The non-GAAP information presented in the common stock offering presentations should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, cash flows from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.
