Other Events On September 11, 2003, FirstEnergy Corp. received an informal data request from the Securities and Exchange Commission asking the company to voluntarily provide information and documents related to its recent restatement of its 2002 annual financial statements. FirstEnergy intends to fully comply with the request and does not anticipate any adverse consequences.

These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms "anticipate," "potential," "expect," "believe," "estimate," and similar words. Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, replacement power costs being higher than anticipated or inadequately hedged, maintenance costs being higher than anticipated, legislative and regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), availability and cost of capital, inability of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station to restart (including because of any inability to obtain a favorable final determination from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) in the fall of 2003, inability to accomplish or realize anticipated benefits of strategic goals, further investigation into the causes of the August 14, 2003, power outage, ability to successfully execute the equity offering, and other similar factors.
