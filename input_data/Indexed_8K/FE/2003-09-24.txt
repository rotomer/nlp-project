The Firm Shares and the Additional Shares are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Shares." The shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share, of the Company to be outstanding after giving effect to the sales contemplated hereby are hereinafter referred to as the "Common Stock." The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3, including a prospectus (Registration No. 333-103865), for the registration of $2,000,000,000 aggregate par value and/or principal amount of its debt securities, common stock, share purchase contracts and/or share purchase units, and will file with the Commission a final prospectus supplement specifically relating to the terms of the Shares pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). Such registration statement has become effective. The Company qualifies for use of Form S-3 for the registration of the Shares, and the Shares are registered under the Securities Act. The prospectus forming a part of such registration statement, at the time such registration statement (or the most recent amendment thereto filed prior to the time of effectiveness of this Agreement) became effective, including all documents incorporated by reference therein at that time pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3, is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus."

II. The Company is advised by you that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of their respective Shares as soon after this underwriting agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as in your judgment is advisable. The Company is further advised by you that the Shares are to be offered to the public at the public offering price set forth in Annex B hereto. Annex B also sets forth the maximum concession and reallowance per Share. III. On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company agrees to sell to the Underwriters the Additional Shares, and the Underwriters shall have the right to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to 4,200,000 Additional Shares at the Purchase Price. The Representatives may exercise this right on behalf of the Underwriters in whole or from time to time in part by giving written notice of each election to exercise the option not later than 30 days after the date of this Agreement.

In further consideration of the agreements of the Underwriters herein contained, the Company covenants as follows: (a) To furnish without charge to the Representatives ten conformed copies of the Registration Statement, including all exhibits filed with the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated by reference therein (other than exhibits which are incorporated by reference therein) and to each other Underwriter a signed copy of the Registration Statement without exhibits and, during the period mentioned in paragraph (c) below, as many copies of the Prospectus and any documents incorporated by reference therein at or after the date thereof and any amendments and supplements thereto as you may reasonably request. The terms "supplement" and "amendments" or "amend" as used in this Agreement shall include all documents filed by the Company with the Commission subsequent to the date of the Prospectus pursuant to the Exchange Act which are deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus. (b) Before amending or supplementing the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or filing with the Commission any document pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, during the period referred to in paragraph (c) below, to furnish to the Representatives a copy of each such proposed amendment, supplement or document for your review prior to filing and not to file any such proposed amendment, supplement or document to which you reasonably object, and to file with the Commission within the applicable period specified in Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act any prospectus required to be filed pursuant to such Rule. (c) If, during such period as the Underwriters are required by law to deliver a Prospectus in connection with sales of the Shares by an Underwriter or dealer after the first date of the public offering of the Shares, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of your counsel or counsel to the Company, to amend the Registration Statement or to amend or supplement the Prospectus or modify the information 10
incorporated by reference therein in order that the Prospectus will not include any untrue statements of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus or modify such information to comply with the Securities Act and the Securities Act Regulations, forthwith to prepare and file with the Commission and to furnish (subject to the conditions in paragraph (b) above), at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which Shares may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters, and to any other dealers upon request, such amendments or supplements to the Prospectus or modifications to the documents incorporated by reference therein, so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended, supplemented or modified will not, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time such Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus will comply with the Securities Act and the Securities Act Regulations. Unless such event relates solely to the activities of the Underwriters (in which case the Underwriters shall assume the expense of preparing any such amendment or supplement), the expenses of complying with this paragraph (c) shall be borne by the Company until the expiration of nine months from the time of effectiveness of this Agreement, and such expenses shall be borne by the Underwriters thereafter. (d) To endeavor to qualify the Shares for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdiction as you shall reasonably request. (e) To make available generally to the Company's security holders and to the Representatives as soon as practicable an earning statement covering a twelve month period beginning after the date of this Agreement which earning statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the Securities Act Regulations. (f) Without the prior written consent of the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, during the period ending 90 days after the date of the Prospectus, not to (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise.

(i) To use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified in the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds." (j) Not to, directly or indirectly, use any of the proceeds from the sale of the Shares, or lend, contribute or otherwise make available any such proceeds to any subsidiary, joint venture partner or other person or entity, for the purpose of financing the activities of any person or entity in violation of any program administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury, including without limitation those implemented by regulations codified in Subtitle B, Chapter V, of Title 31, Code of Federal Regulations. VIII. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or the Basic Prospectus (including documents incorporated by reference therein), or caused by any 12
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; provided further, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission of material fact made in any preliminary prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph of Section VIII shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Shares concerned, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter occurs under the circumstance where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (i) the Company had previously furnished copies of the Prospectus to the Representatives, (ii) delivery of the Prospectus was required by the Securities Act to be made to such person, (iii) the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the preliminary prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and (iv) there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Shares to such person, a copy of the Prospectus. Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, any amendments or supplements thereto, or the Basic Prospectus. In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. 13
If the indemnification provided for in this Section VIII is unavailable to an indemnified party under the first or second paragraphs hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits conferred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregrate public offering price of the Shares set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section VIII are several in the proportions which the respective number of Shares set forth opposite their names in Annex A bear to the total number of Shares so set forth in Annex A, or in such other proportions as may be determined pursuant to Section IX, and not joint. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section VIII were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section VIII, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amounts of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section VIII are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section VIII and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter to any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, any of its directors, officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares. IX. The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the Representatives to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New 14
the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. X. This Agreement shall become effective when it has been executed by the Company and the Representatives. If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Shares which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the total number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the total number of Shares, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the number of Shares set forth opposite their names in Annex A bear to the total number of Shares so set forth opposite the names of all such nondefaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase; provided that in no event shall the number of Shares which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section I be increased pursuant to this Section X by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the total number of Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the total number of the Shares and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company except as provided in Section VIII. In any such case which does not result in such termination, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in each case, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 15
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original and all of which shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument binding on all of the parties hereto.

Exhibit 1(a) EXECUTION COPY FIRSTENERGY CORP. ---------- 28,000,000 SHARES COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $.10 PER SHARE UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT September 12, 2003
September 12, 2003 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and the other Underwriters listed on Annex A hereto c/o Citigroup Global Capital Inc. 388 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013 and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated 1585 Broadway New York, New York 10036 Ladies and Gentlemen: I. FirstEnergy Corp., an Ohio corporation (hereinafter called the "Company"), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, to issue and sell to Citigroup Global Capital Inc. ("Citigroup"), Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley"), and each of the other underwriters named on Annex A hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters", which term, when the context permits, shall also include any underwriters substituted as hereinafter provided in Section X), for whom Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are acting as representatives (in such capacity, the "Representatives"), and the Underwriters, upon the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the conditions hereinafter stated, agree to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the Company the number of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.10 per share, identified in Annex B hereto, set forth on Annex A hereto opposite their names (in an aggregate number of shares of 28,000,000), together with associated share purchase rights, at a purchase price (the "Purchase Price") identified in Annex B hereto (the "Firm Shares"). The Company also proposes, subject to the same terms and conditions referenced above, to issue and sell to the Underwriters not more than an additional 4,200,000 shares of its common stock, par value $.10 per share, together with associated share purchase rights (the "Additional Shares"), if and to the extent you, as Representatives, shall have determined to exercise, on behalf of the Underwriters, the right to purchase such shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.10 per share, granted to the Underwriters in Section III hereof. The Firm Shares and the Additional Shares are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Shares." The shares of common stock, par value $.10 per share, of the Company to be outstanding after giving effect to the sales contemplated hereby are hereinafter referred to as the "Common Stock." The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3, including a prospectus (Registration No. 333-103865), for the registration of $2,000,000,000 aggregate par value and/or principal amount of its debt securities, common stock, share purchase contracts and/or share purchase units, and will file with the Commission a final prospectus supplement specifically relating to the terms of the Shares pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). Such registration statement has become effective. The Company qualifies for use of Form S-3 for the registration of the Shares, and the Shares are registered under the Securities Act. The prospectus forming a part of such registration statement, at the time such registration statement (or the most recent amendment thereto filed prior to the time of effectiveness of this Agreement) became effective, including all documents incorporated by reference therein at that time pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3, is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." In the event that (i) the Basic Prospectus shall have been amended, revised or supplemented prior to the time of effectiveness of this Agreement, including without limitation by any preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Shares, or (ii) the Company shall have filed documents pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") after the time such registration statement (or the most recent amendment thereto filed prior to the time of effectiveness of this Agreement) became effective and prior to the time of effectiveness of this Agreement, which are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3, the term "Basic Prospectus" as used herein
reflecting such incorporation by reference. Such registration statement in the form in which it became effective and as it may have been amended by all amendments thereto as of the time of effectiveness of this Agreement (including, for these purposes, as an amendment any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus (the "Incorporated Documents")), and the Basic Prospectus as it shall be supplemented to reflect the terms of the offering and sale of the Shares by a prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, are hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus," respectively. II. The Company is advised by you that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of their respective Shares as soon after this underwriting agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as in your judgment is advisable. The Company is further advised by you that the Shares are to be offered to the public at the public offering price set forth in Annex B hereto. Annex B also sets forth the maximum concession and reallowance per Share. III. On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company agrees to sell to the Underwriters the Additional Shares, and the Underwriters shall have the right to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to 4,200,000 Additional Shares at the Purchase Price. The Representatives may exercise this right on behalf of the Underwriters in whole or from time to time in part by giving written notice of each election to exercise the option not later than 30 days after the date of this Agreement. Any exercise notice shall specify the number of Additional Shares to be purchased by the Underwriters and the date on which such shares are to be purchased. Each purchase date must be a least one business day after the written notice is given and may not be earlier than the closing date for the Firm Shares nor later than ten business days after the date of such notice. Additional Shares may be purchased as provided in Section IV hereof solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments made in connection with the offering of the Firm Shares.

(j) Not to, directly or indirectly, use any of the proceeds from the sale of the Shares, or lend, contribute or otherwise make available any such proceeds to any subsidiary, joint venture partner or other person or entity, for the purpose of financing the activities of any person or entity in violation of any program administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury, including without limitation those implemented by regulations codified in Subtitle B, Chapter V, of Title 31, Code of Federal Regulations. VIII. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or the Basic Prospectus (including documents incorporated by reference therein), or caused by any 12
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; provided further, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission of material fact made in any preliminary prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph of Section VIII shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Shares concerned, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter occurs under the circumstance where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (i) the Company had previously furnished copies of the Prospectus to the Representatives, (ii) delivery of the Prospectus was required by the Securities Act to be made to such person, (iii) the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the preliminary prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and (iv) there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Shares to such person, a copy of the Prospectus. Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, any amendments or supplements thereto, or the Basic Prospectus. In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. 13
If the indemnification provided for in this Section VIII is unavailable to an indemnified party under the first or second paragraphs hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits conferred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregrate public offering price of the Shares set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section VIII are several in the proportions which the respective number of Shares set forth opposite their names in Annex A bear to the total number of Shares so set forth in Annex A, or in such other proportions as may be determined pursuant to Section IX, and not joint. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section VIII were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section VIII, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amounts of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section VIII are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section VIII and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter to any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, any of its directors, officers or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares. IX. The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the Representatives to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New 14
the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. X. This Agreement shall become effective when it has been executed by the Company and the Representatives. If any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Shares which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder, and the total number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the total number of Shares, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the number of Shares set forth opposite their names in Annex A bear to the total number of Shares so set forth opposite the names of all such nondefaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase; provided that in no event shall the number of Shares which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section I be increased pursuant to this Section X by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the consent of such Underwriter. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the total number of Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the total number of the Shares and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company except as provided in Section VIII. In any such case which does not result in such termination, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in each case, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 15
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original and all of which shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument binding on all of the parties hereto.

Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley"), as --------- --------------- representatives (the "Representatives") of the several Underwriters, including --------------- Citigroup and Morgan Stanley (the "Underwriters"), propose to enter into an ------------ Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with FirstEnergy Corp., an ---------------------- Ohio corporation (the "Company"), providing for the public offering (the "Public ------- ------ Offering") by the several Underwriters of 28,000,000 shares (the "Shares") of - -------- ------ common stock, par value $.10 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"). ------------ To induce the Underwriters that may participate in the Public Offering to continue their efforts in connection with the Public Offering, the undersigned hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending 90 days after the date of the final prospectus relating to the Public Offering (the "Prospectus"), (1) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or (2) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (a) the sale of any Shares to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement or (b) transactions relating to shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired in open market transactions after the completion of the Public Offering. In addition, the undersigned agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending 90 days after the date of the Prospectus, make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any shares of Common Stock or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock. The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the Company's transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the undersigned's share of Common Stock except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions. The undersigned understands that the Company and the Underwriters are relying upon this Lock-Up Agreement in proceeding toward consummation of the Public Offering. The undersigned further understands that this Lock-Up Agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigned's heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.
Whether or not the Public Offering actually occurs depends on a number of factors, including market conditions. Any Public Offering will only be made pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, the terms of which are subject to negotiation between the Company and the Underwriters.
