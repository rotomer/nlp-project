Item 5. Other Events On November 13, 2003, FirstEnergy Corp. announced that it has reached an agreement with NRG Energy, Inc., with regard to a never-completed sale of four FirstEnergy power plants to NRG Energy. Under the agreement, FirstEnergy's claim against NRG Energy would be allowed in the amount of $396 million, subject to U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval and required authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. NRG Energy and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary bankruptcy petitions in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York in May 2003. Pursuant to NRG Energy's proposed Plan of Reorganization, FirstEnergy, as an unsecured creditor, would receive a settlement value of approximately 50 cents on the dollar, or an estimated value of $198 million, with payment in the form of cash, notes and common stock, as indicated below: o 12% in cash, or $23.8 million, o 15.2% in notes, with an estimated value of $30.2 million, and o 72.8% in new NRG Energy common stock, which is expected to be issued by the reorganized company. Based on the stock's nominal value as estimated in the Plan of Reorganization, the shares allocated to FirstEnergy would be worth approximately $144 million. The actual market value of the shares will be determined after trading begins in the public market. The settlement is related to NRG Energy's guarantee of obligations of its Able Acquisitions LLC affiliate's 2002 agreement to buy the Ashtabula, Bay Shore, Eastlake, and Lakeshore plants, which are owned by FirstEnergy's Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company and Toledo Edison Company subsidiaries, for $1.5 billion. The sale was never completed. Forward-Looking Statement: This Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements based on information currently available to management.
