Item 5. Other Events FirstEnergy Corp.'s FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) subsidiary recently received a grand jury subpoena which calls for the production of certain documents and records relating to the inspection and maintenance of the reactor vessel head at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station. The documents and materials are to be presented to a grand jury sitting in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. FENOC intends to comply fully with the grand jury subpoena and fully cooperate with the investigation. The Company is unable to predict whether legal actions related to the subpoena may be instituted or otherwise what might be the outcome of this investigation. FENOC also remains subject to civil enforcement action by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission related to Davis-Besse.

These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms "anticipate", "expect", "believe", "estimate" and similar words.
