EXHIBIT 99 FirstEnergy Corp. For Release: December 23, 2003 76 South Main Street Akron, OH 44308 www.firstenergycorp.com News Media Contact: Investor Contact: Kristen Baird Kurt Turosky (330) 761-4261 (330) 384-5500 FIRSTENERGY ISSUES STATEMENT ON STANDARD & POORS RATING ACTION; ANNOUNCES WEBCAST OF TELECONFERNCE WITH ANALYSTS FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) today issued the following statement regarding Standard & Poor's decision to reduce FirstEnergy's credit rating: "We are disappointed with Standard & Poor's rating action today and respectfully disagree with their conclusion. While we have faced a number of operational challenges this past year, we have made steady progress toward enhancing our financial strength and flexibility, and improving our overall credit profile. We will reduce outstanding debt and preferred stock this year by approximately $1.7 billion. Our cash generation remains among the strongest in the industry, estimated on a non-GAAP basis(*) at $720 million for 2003 and more than $1 billion in 2004; and our liquidity position remains favorable. Our recently completed common equity offering generated $935 million in net proceeds, which was used to reduce outstanding debt, and the recent renewal of our $1 billion short-term credit facility was strongly supported by our banking group. A portion of the company's $1.2 billion in undrawn credit capacity will be used to meet up to $470 million in cash and collateral calls that could be triggered by Standard & Poor's action. Our overall credit profile was meaningfully improved during 2003 and we expect continued substantial progress in 2004 through the use of our free cash to continue to reduce debt outstanding and improve our credit profile. The company is maintaining the earnings guidance for 2004 announced at the December 3 analyst meeting of $2.70 to $2.85 per share on a GAAP basis."

FirstEnergy subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity; exploration and production of oil and natural gas; transmission and marketing of natural gas; energy management and other energy- related services. (*) This news release contains the non-GAAP financial measures "free cash generation." Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management believes that investors would find this non-GAAP measure useful because it shows the amount of free cash expected to be available to the company.
