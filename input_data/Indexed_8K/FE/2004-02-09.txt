Item 5. Other Events On February 6, 2004, Moody's Investor's Service issued a press release which lowered its senior unsecured debt rating on FirstEnergy Corp. to Baa3 from Baa2 and lowered the senior secured ratings of its utility subsidiaries Jersey Central Power & Light Company, Metropolitan Edison Company and Pennsylvania Electric Company to Baa1 from A2. Moody's also assigned ratings for the syndicated bank credit facilities for FirstEnergy and Ohio Edison Company as follows: Baa3 to FirstEnergy's three unsecured revolving credit facilities that total $1.25 billion and Baa2 to Ohio Edison's three unsecured revolving credit facilities that total $500 million. Moody's confirmed the ratings of FirstEnergy's other utilities Ohio Edison Company (senior secured Baa1), Pennsylvania Power Company (senior secured Baa1), The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (senior secured Baa2) and The Toledo Edison Company (senior secured Baa2). This action concludes the review of the ratings of FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries for possible downgrade and the ratings outlook for FirstEnergy and all of its subsidiaries is stable.
