Item 5. Other Events On May 24, 2004, FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp., announced that the 1,260-megawatt Perry Nuclear Power Plant is expected to return to service next week, following repairs to an emergency service water pump. The plant was removed from service on Saturday May 22, 2004, after routine testing indicated that the pump was not maintaining a normal flow level. An initial inspection found a broken coupling on the pump's shaft, and a complete review is under way. A new pump and new couplings, made of stronger material, are being installed to help ensure better reliability. The plant will return to service after the equipment has been thoroughly tested and the review has been completed. The combined ownership and leasehold interests in the Perry Nuclear Power Plant are: The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company - 44.85%; Ohio Edison Company - 30.00%; The Toledo Edison Company - 19.91%; and Pennsylvania Power Company - 5.24%.
