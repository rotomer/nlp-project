Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition On October 21, 2004, FirstEnergy Corp. issued two public announcements, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1, and 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference. FirstEnergy's Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community contain non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community include normalized earnings per share, which is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "unusual items". Unusual items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are not routine, are related to discontinued businesses or are the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Management believes presenting normalized earnings calculated in this manner provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of FirstEnergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. FirstEnergy's management frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies. The non-GAAP information presented in the Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, reported earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits (c) Exhibits. Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release issued by FirstEnergy Corp., dated October 21, 2004 99.2 Consolidated Report to the Financial Community, dated October 21, 2004 Forward-Looking Statement: This Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements based on information currently available to management. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms "anticipate", "potential", "expect", "believe", "estimate" and similar words. Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, replacement power costs being higher than anticipated or inadequately hedged, maintenance costs being higher than anticipated, legislative and regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), adverse regulatory or legal decisions and the outcome of governmental investigations (including revocation of necessary licenses or operating permits), availability and cost of capital, the continuing availability and operation of generating units, the inability to accomplish or realize anticipated benefits of strategic goals, the ability to improve electric commodity margins and to experience growth in the distribution business, the ability to access the public securities markets, further investigation into the causes of the August 14, 2003 regional power outage and the outcome, cost and other effects of present and potential legal and administrative proceedings and claims related to that outage, the final outcome in the proceeding related to FirstEnergy's Application for a Rate Stabilization Plan in Ohio, the risks and other factors discussed from time to time in FirstEnergy's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including its annual report on Form 10-K (as amended) for the year ended December 31, 2003, and its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, and other similar factors.

FirstEnergy Corp. For Release: October 21, 2004 76 South Main Street Akron, Ohio 44308 www.firstenergycorp.com News Media Contact: Investor Contact: Keith Hancock Kurt Turosky (330) 384-5247 (330) 384-5500 FIRSTENERGY REPORTS HIGHER THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today reported that third quarter 2004 earnings on a GAAP basis were $298.6 million, or basic and diluted earnings of $0.91 per share of common stock. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, earnings were $319.1 million, or basic and diluted earnings of $0.97 per share of common stock, excluding unusual charges related to the sale and impairment of non-core assets and severance costs associated with the reorganization of the company's nuclear operations. That compares with GAAP earnings of $152.7 million, or basic earnings of $0.51 per share ($0.50 diluted) of common stock in the third quarter of 2003, including the impact of the Davis-Besse extended outage and other unusual charges. Excluding these items, last year's earnings were $280.2 million, or basic earnings of $0.94 per share ($0.93 diluted) of common stock on a non-GAAP basis. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2004 were $3.5 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2003. "Our third quarter earnings reflect the strong progress we've made this year, particularly in the areas of electricity distribution, generating plant performance and our debt-reduction program," said President and Chief Executive Officer Anthony J. Alexander. "The impact of milder weather on sales was offset in part by operational improvements and cost-savings efforts that continue to be achieved throughout the organization." (more)

Sales of such assets in the third quarter and sales currently anticipated in the fourth quarter resulted in a charge of $0.05 per share of common stock during the quarter from losses and impairments recorded for such activities. FirstEnergy's debt paydown and refinancing program resulted in a decrease of approximately $982 million in debt during the first nine months of 2004, producing annualized savings of approximately $78 million. The company remains on track to achieve its goal of reducing debt by at least $1 billion this year. At the end of the third quarter, the total capacity of FirstEnergy's primary credit facilities and those of its subsidiaries stood at $2.3 billion. (more) 2
For the first nine months of 2004, earnings on a GAAP basis were $676.7 million, or basic earnings of $2.07 per share ($2.06 diluted) of common stock.

Despite the milder weather, generation sales were 5% higher during the third quarter of 2004 compared with last year's third quarter due to increased sales in the wholesale market. FirstEnergy's generation fleet continued to show improved performance, enabling the company to take advantage of spot market sales. Its generating plants posted a record output for the quarter and for the first nine months of 2004 of 19.8 billion and 57.2 billion kilowatt-hours, respectively.

Exhibit 99-2 Consolidated Report to the Financial Community - 3rd Quarter Consolidated Report to the Financial Community Third Quarter 2004 - Unaudited (Released October 21, 2004) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3Q 2004 Results vs. 3Q 2003 - --------------------------- o| Electric distribution deliveries were flat as a 2% decrease in residential deliveries from milder weather was offset by modest increases in commercial and industrial deliveries. Cooling-degree-days were 7% below the same period last year and 4% below normal. Total electric generation sales rose 5% due to a 20% increase in wholesale sales. o Electric gross margin decreased $67 million after adjusting for changes in regulatory deferrals, the impact of JCP&L's rate decision in August 2003, and last year's Davis-Besse replacement power costs. The decrease in electric gross margin resulted from reduced regulated generation sales and distribution deliveries due to milder weather, and lower unregulated generation sales as a result of non-renewal of expiring contracts. o Generation operating expenses decreased $34 million primarily due to the absence of a nuclear refueling outage this quarter, compared with the Beaver Valley Unit #1 outage last year, and lower fossil maintenance expenses. o Energy delivery expenses decreased $45 million principally due to lower storm-related maintenance this quarter compared to expenses from hurricane Isabel last year, and a higher level of construction activities this quarter compared to more maintenance activities last year. o Pension, OPEB, and other employee benefit costs decreased approximately $23 million as a result of favorable market returns in 2003, changes to health care benefits for retirees, and Medicare legislation regarding prescription drugs. o Total depreciation and amortization expenses, adjusted for the regulatory deferrals and the JCP&L rate case impact, decreased $6 million. The decrease was primarily due to increased shopping incentive deferrals ($15 million) and capitalization of carrying charges on the deferrals ($9 million), partially offset by higher Ohio transition cost amortization ($20 million).
o Net interest charges decreased $49 million. Financing activities during the quarter included $533 million in mandatory long-term debt redemptions, $17 million in optional debt redemptions, and $236 million of refinancing and repricing transactions. These are expected to result in annualized savings of approximately $47 million. The issuance of 32 million additional shares of common stock in the third quarter of 2003 diluted earnings by $0.09 per share. o During the quarter, we recognized two unusual charges totaling $0.06 per share. The first reflects a $0.05 per share charge for losses and impairments relating to the divestiture of certain non-core, technology- related investments. The second charge of $0.01 per share relates to the severance costs associated with the reorganization at FENOC announced in August. 2004 Earnings and Free Cash Flow Guidance* - ------------------------------------------ o Earnings guidance for 2004, excluding unusual charges, remains at $2.70 to $2.85 per share. Year-to-date normalized non-GAAP earnings now stand at $2.18 per share. o Free cash flow (cash flow less capital expenditures and common stock dividend) guidance for 2004 remains at $825 million. * The GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation statements are attached and available on FirstEnergy Corp.'s website at www.firstenergycorp.com/ir. --------------------------

11 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Voluntary Pension Contribution - ------------------------------ On September 14, FirstEnergy made a voluntary $500 million contribution to its pension plan. The election to pre-fund the plan is expected to eliminate cash contributions of approximately $600 million during the 2006 - 2007 time period. Since the contribution resulted in a $200 million tax benefit, we have effectively eliminated a $500 million liability through a net borrowing of $300 million. We estimate that the pre-funding election should be accretive to earnings by about $0.06 per share during each of the next three years. The pre-funding resulted in the plan being essentially fully funded on an Accumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO) basis. Ohio Rate Stabilization Plan - ---------------------------- On August 5, FirstEnergy adopted the modified Rate Stabilization Plan approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). The approved plan provides for continuing current generation prices, with opportunities to seek recovery of increased fuel costs from 2006 through 2008. The approved plan also provides for a competitive bid auction to be conducted to determine if the market can provide lower generation prices than available under the Rate Stabilization Plan. Competitive Bid Process - ----------------------- On October 6, the PUCO approved the rules for the Competitive Bid Process (CBP) for FirstEnergy's Ohio load. The CBP suppliers will be responsible for providing firm generation service to meet the actual load requirements, less special contract and shopping customers, for a three-year supply period (2006 - 2008). The PUCO set the load cap for an individual supplier at 65% of the total load. The PUCO and NERA Economic Consulting, the CPB Auction Manager, agreed on a starting price of 5.5(cent)/kWh. Full details on the competitive bid process can be found at www.firstenergy-auction.com. The CBP will commence on November 17, and the PUCO will determine the acceptance or rejection of the CBP results within two business days after the completion of the auction. Reliability Settlement in Pennsylvania - -------------------------------------- On September 30, FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania electric utility operating companies entered into a settlement agreement that addresses all issues related to the companies' reliability case pending before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The agreement outlines steps to enhance service reliability, performance reporting and communications, and requires the companies to spend no less than $255 million annually on transmission and distribution. On October 14, the Administrative Law Judge recommended adoption of the Settlement. We anticipate the Commission will rule on the settlement by year-end. Nuclear Update - -------------- On August 23, FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) completed its reorganization designed to further improve the safe operations and reliable performance of its three nuclear plants. The reorganization resulted in a staffing reduction of 7%. FENOC's new organization is based on extensive benchmarking of the best performers in the industry from the perspective of safety, performance, and staffing levels. Standardized organizational structures are now in place at each plant and corporate oversight has been expanded. On October 18, Beaver Valley Unit 1 began its scheduled refueling outage. Unit 1 operated for a unit record of 339 consecutive days and posted an availability factor of 99.65% since the unit was last refueled in April 2003. During the outage, inspections of the reactor head and steam generators will be conducted, both of which are scheduled to be replaced during the unit's 2006 refueling outage. The outage is anticipated to be approximately 30 days in duration. 11
