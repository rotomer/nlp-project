Item 8.01 Other Events In late 2003, FirstEnergy Corp.'s (Company) FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) subsidiary received a grand jury subpoena requesting the production of certain documents and records relating to the inspection and maintenance of the reactor vessel head at the Davis-Besse Plant, which is owned by The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (51.38%) and The Toledo Edison Company (48.62%). The documents and materials were provided to the grand jury sitting in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. On December 10, 2004, the Company received a letter from the United States Attorney's Office, stating that FENOC is a target of the federal grand jury investigation into alleged false statements made to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in the Fall of 2001 in response to NRC Bulletin 2001-01. The letter also said that the designation of FENOC as a target indicates that, in the view of the prosecutors assigned to the matter, it is likely that federal charges will be returned against FENOC by the grand jury. FirstEnergy previously disclosed the grand jury investigation as it relates to its FENOC subsidiary in the Company's 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Form 8-K filed on November 21, 2003, and in Form 10-Q filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the first three quarters of 2004.
