Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On March 18, 2005, FirstEnergy Corp. (Company) announced that it has reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and three states that will result in significant reductions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from current levels at FirstEnergys generating plants. The agreement, upon final approval by the U. S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio, will resolve all issues related to various parties actions against the Companys W. H. Sammis Plant in the pending New Source Review case. The agreement, which is in the form of a consent decree, also has been signed by the states of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, and has been filed with the Court. The agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference, is subject to final approval by the Court.
As disclosed by FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries, Ohio Edison Company (OE) and Pennsylvania Power Company (Penn), in prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the EPA issued Notices of Violation or Compliance Orders in 1999 and 2000 to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W. H. Sammis Plant, which is owned by OE and Penn. In addition, the DOJ filed eight civil complaints against various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint against OE and Penn in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. 
Under the agreement, FirstEnergy will install environmental controls at the Sammis Plant, as well as install or upgrade environmental systems at a number of other power plants owned by FirstEnergy subsidiaries (OE, Penn, The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company and The Toledo Edison Company). The estimated $1.1 billion investment the environmental improvement program is consistent with assumptions reflected in the Companys long-term financial planning. Nearly all of the expenditures are expected to be capital additions, with the majority occurring between 2008 and 2010.
In addition, FirstEnergy will pay an $8.5 million civil penalty to the DOJ and contribute up to $25 million over five years to support environmentally beneficial projects in the states that were parties to the case.
Item 8.01 Other Events
On March 18, 2005, FirstEnergy Corp. issued two public announcements regarding the settlement agreement discussed in Item 1.01 above. The press release and Letter to the Investment Community are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, and incorporated by reference.

   EXHIBIT 99.1
   
   
   
  
 
 
Akron, OH - FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) announced today it has reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), the U.S. Department of Justice, and three states that will result in significant reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from current levels at FirstEnergys generating plants. The agreement, upon final approval by the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio, will resolve all issues related to various parties' actions against the companys W. H. Sammis Plant in the pending New Source Review case. The Sammis Plant is owned by FirstEnergy subsidiaries Ohio Edison Company and Pennsylvania Power Company.
 
"This builds on the significant progress we have been making to protect the environment while resolving uncertainty related to New Source Review," said Anthony J. Alexander, president and chief executive officer of FirstEnergy. "And, our plans to install additional environmental controls will help us meet Clean Air Act regulations recently announced by the U.S. EPA and enable us to continue utilizing our generating plants to meet our customers' electricity needs."
The agreement, which is in the form of a consent decree, also has been signed by the states of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, and has been filed with the Court.
 
Under the agreement, FirstEnergy will install environmental controls at the Sammis Plant in Stratton, Ohio, as well as at a number of other power plants. FirstEnergy also will upgrade existing scrubber systems on units 1 through 3 of its Bruce Mansfield Plant in Shippingport, PA.
Projects at the Sammis Plant will include equipment designed to reduce 95 percent of SO
2
 emissions and 90 percent of NOx emissions on the plants largest two units. In addition, 
the plants five smaller units will be controlled by equipment designed to reduce at least 50 percent of SO and 70 percent of NOx emissions. The agreement also calls for additional reductions at other plants, which may be accomplished with the installation of scrubbers and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), as well as through repowering or other strategies. In total, additional environmental controls could be installed on nearly 5,500 megawatts (MW) of the companys 7,400 MW of coal-based generating capacity, with construction beginning in 2005 and completed no later than 2012.
2
Much of the companys remaining generation comes from nearly 3,800 MW of non-emitting nuclear plants, which generate approximately 40 percent of the companys annual output.
The estimated $1.1 billion investment in environmental improvements is consistent with assumptions reflected in the companys long-term financial planning. Nearly all of the expenditures are expected to be capital additions and depreciated over a period of years. The majority of these expenditures are expected to be made between 2008 and 2010.
In addition, the company will pay an $8.5 million civil penalty to the Department of Justice and contribute up to $25 million over five years to support environmentally beneficial projects.

Background
In 1999 and 2000, the EPA issued Notices of Violation (NOV) or Compliance Orders to nine utilities covering 44 power plants, including the W. H. Sammis Plant which is owned by Ohio Edison Company (OE) and Pennsylvania Power Company (Penn). In addition, the DOJ filed eight civil complaints against various investor-owned utilities, which included a complaint against OE and Penn in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases are referred to as New Source Review cases.
The NOV and complaint allege violations of the Clean Air Act based on operation and maintenance of the W. H. Sammis Plant dating back to 1984. The complaint requested permanent injunctive relief to require the installation of "best available control technology" and civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day of violation. On August 7, 2003, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ruled that 11 projects undertaken at the W. H. Sammis Plant between 1984 and 1998 required pre-construction permits under the Clean Air Act. That ruling concluded the liability phase of the case, which deals with applicability of Prevention of Significant Deterioration provisions of the Clean Air Act.
The remedy phase of the trial to address civil penalties and any actions to further reduce emissions at the plant had been delayed without rescheduling by the Court because the parties were engaged in meaningful settlement negotiations.
Todays agreement, which is in the form of a consent decree, also has been signed by the states of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, and has been filed with the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio. The agreement, upon final approval by the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Ohio, will resolve all of the issues related to the various parties' actions against the company's W. H. Sammis Plant in the pending New Source Review cases.
Environmental Modifications at Power Plant Facilities
Under the agreement, FirstEnergy will install additional environmental controls at the Sammis Plant in Stratton, Ohio, as well as at a number of its other power plants.
Projects at the Sammis Plant will include equipment, designed to reduce 95 percent of SO
2
 emissions and 90 percent of NOx emissions on the plants largest two units (Units 6 & 7). In addition, 
the plants five smaller units will be controlled by equipment designed to reduce at least 50 percent of SO and 70 percent of NOx emissions. FirstEnergy also will upgrade existing scrubber systems on units 1 through 3 of its Bruce Mansfield Plant in Shippingport, PA.
2
The agreement also calls for additional reductions at Burger Units 4 & 5 and Eastlake Unit 5, which may be accomplished with the installation of additional scrubbers, SCR, selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR),  as well as through repowering or other strategies. In total, additional environmental controls could be installed on nearly 5,500 megawatts (MW) of the companys 7,400 MW of coal-based generating capacity, with construction beginning in 2005 and to be completed no later than 2012.

A detailed explanation of the environmental improvements is contained in the attached settlement agreement.
Financial Impact
FirstEnergy has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $8.5 million upon approval of the settlement. It has also agreed to fund and/or implement Environmentally Beneficial Projects as described in the settlement agreement cumulatively valued at up to $25 million. These projects consist of:
 
Estimated Capital Expenditures
The precise level and timing of capital expenditures required to comply with the settlement agreement cannot yet be predicted. The following table presents a conceptual estimate based on information available at this time.
*
Excludes capitalized interest and other overhead costs. Expenditures reflect a 3% annual inflation rate.
 
The estimated $1.1 billion investment in environmental improvements is consistent with assumptions reflected in the company's long-term financial planning.
 
While these environmental expenditures will materially assist FirstEnergy in complying with the new Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and Clean Air Mercury Rules, additional environmental controls will be needed. Given the complexity of these issues, including the ability to meet compliance through either allowance purchases or control installations, we are not able to estimate the total capital cost of compliance with these new rules at this time.
3
Administrative Process
The parties to the settlement acknowledge that entry of the Consent Decree is subject to certain procedures, which require this settlement to be noticed in the Federal Register for a period of 60 days. The public will have an opportunity to comment and the Federal Government will have the right to withdraw or withhold consent if the comments disclose facts or considerations indicating that the Consent Decree is inappropriate, improper or inadequate.
Business Strategy
We have characterized environmental expenditures at our coal-based stations as investments that will allow us to operate these plants for another 25 years or longer. Our coal-based facilities will have a net book investment well below that of a new plant even with these additional emission control expenditures. Additionally, we expect to increase the rated capacity of a number of these units through installation of more efficient turbine blades, increased fan capacities, or other technologies at the time we make the necessary environmental expenditures. These capacity increases will assist us in recovering the added costs of the environmental modifications.
This settlement resolves uncertainty and is an important milestone in our continued progress. It also provides a foundation that will allow us to continue to create shareholder value through the economic operation of our cost-effective coal-based generation fleet.
