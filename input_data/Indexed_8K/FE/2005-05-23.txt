EXHIBIT 99.1
 
FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) said today that it had been notified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station will return to the standard oversight process, effective July 1, 2005.
            "We are, of course, gratified by this news," said FENOC President and Chief Nuclear Officer Gary Leidich. "We believe this decision reflects the major improvements weve made at Davis-Besse, and its safe operations since the restart last year. It also is an acknowledgement of our employees renewed commitment to safe operations."
Enhancements to the plant included such projects as modifying back-up pumps on safety systems, increasing the capability of the plants emergency containment sump, stripping and repainting the dome of the containment building and installing a state-of-the-art reactor coolant system leak monitor. Davis-Besse also revamped its reactor coolant system leak detection program, making it one of the most effective in the industry, and expanded programs for employees to report safety issues.
           "While we have made a lot of progress at Davis-Besse," Leidich said, "we understand that we must remain vigilant against complacency. By returning to the standard regulatory oversight, we know that our hard work is paying off and that were on the right track."
