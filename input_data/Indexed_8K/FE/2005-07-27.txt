ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2.):
[ ] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425)
[ ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12)
[ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b))
[ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 27, 2005, FirstEnergy Corp. issued two public announcements, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference. FirstEnergy's Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community contain non-GAAP* financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community of the non-GAAP* financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
The Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community include normalized earnings per share, which is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "unusual items". Unusual items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are not routine, may be related to discontinued businesses or may be the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Management believes presenting normalized earnings calculated in this manner provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of FirstEnergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of others in the energy sector. The Consolidated Report to the Financial Community also includes references to free cash flow and cash generation which are not defined under GAAP. Management believes presenting these non-GAAP* measures provides useful information to investors in assessing FirstEnergy's normalized operating performance from a cash perspective. FirstEnergys management frequently references these non-GAAP* financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
On July 27, 2005, FirstEnergy Corp. raised its earnings and cash flow guidance for 2005 and announced earnings and cash flow guidance for 2006. The company's non-GAAP* earnings guidance for 2005 is $2.85 to $3.00 per share of common stock. The company expects that non-GAAP* free cash flow for 2005 will be approximately $535 million. The company's earnings guidance for 2006 is $3.40 to $3.60 per share of common stock. The company is currently unaware of any specific unusual charges or credits that will become reconciling items between earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP* basis in 2006. The company estimates that non-GAAP* free cash flow for 2006 will range from $280 million to $380 million. FirstEnergy issued a Press Release and Letter to the Investment Community that provide additional related details. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Press Release and Letter to the Investment Community of the non-GAAP* financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The Press Release and Letter to the Investment Community are furnished, not filed, as Exhibits 99.3 and 99.4, respectively, and are incorporated by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) Exhibits.
*This Form 8-K contains non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustment that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today reported that second quarter 2005 net income on a non-GAAP
(*)
basis was $233.3 million, or basic and diluted earnings of $0.71 per share of common stock, excluding two unusual items: a one-time gain of $0.05 per share from the settlement of rate cases in New Jersey associated with the companys Jersey Central Power & Light subsidiary, offset by a $0.22 per share write-off of Ohio deferred tax benefits that are not expected to be realized due to recent changes in Ohios tax system. On a GAAP basis, net income was $178.0 million, or basic and diluted earnings of $0.54 per share of common stock. The adjusted earnings are at the top end of the range included in the companys original earnings guidance for the second quarter.
Those results compare with non-GAAP net income of $221.6 million in the second quarter of 2004, or basic and diluted earnings of $0.67 per share of common stock. Including unusual items, earnings for the second quarter of 2004 were $204.0 million, or basic and diluted earnings of $0.62 per share of common stock on a GAAP basis.
Total revenues for the second quarter of 2005 were $2.9 billion, down from $3.0 billion reported in the second quarter of 2004. This is attributable to lower wholesale sales revenues, which
reflect the revised net reporting methodology for PJM sales and purchase transactions described in the company's first quarter 2005 earnings release.
Since this revised reporting methodology also produced a corresponding reduction in purchased power costs, there was no impact on net income.
2
 "I am pleased that we were able to exceed the second quarter earnings consensus estimate of analysts, excluding the impact of unusual items," said President and Chief Executive Officer Anthony J. Alexander. "These results reflect the overall progress weve made, particularly in the areas of retail electricity sales, generating plant performance and debt reduction. Our second quarter earnings, part of six consecutive quarters of delivering consistent financial performance, also were driven by operational improvements and cost-savings efforts that we continue to achieve across our organization."
   
3
A return to more seasonal weather toward the end of the second quarter of 2005 helped produce a 2.4-percent increase in kilowatt-hour deliveries compared with the year-prior quarter.
Also, strong performance by FirstEnergys generation fleet helped the company avoid higher-cost supply alternatives. Its generating plants posted a record gross output for the quarter and for the first six months of 2005 of 19.1 billion and 37.9 billion kilowatt-hours, respectively.
For the first six months of 2005, net income on a GAAP basis was $337.7 million, or basic earnings of $1.03 per share ($1.02 diluted) of common stock. Excluding unusual items, earnings on a non-GAAP basis were $388.4 million, or basic and diluted earnings of $1.18 per share.
That compares with net income on a GAAP basis of $378.0 million for the first six months of 2004, or basic earnings of $1.16 per share ($1.15 diluted) of common stock. Excluding unusual charges, non-GAAP earnings were $433.9 million, or basic earnings of $1.33 per share ($1.32 diluted) of common stock.
Revenues for the first six months of 2005 were $5.7 billion, compared with $6.0 billion for the same period last year. Expenses in the first six months of 2005 reflect two scheduled nuclear refueling outages, while there were no refueling outages during the corresponding period in 2004.

FirstEnergy retired approximately $269 million of debt and preferred stock during the first six months of 2005 through its debt paydown and refinancing program. The companys goal is to reduce debt by at least $600 million during the year. FirstEnergy also refinanced $310 million of long-term debt in the first half of 2005. In total, these redemption and refinancing activities are expected to produce financing cost savings of $25 million in 2005 and $33 million in 2006.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Regulatory Update
On May 18, 2005, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) granted the accounting authority for FirstEnergys Ohio utility operating companies to defer, for future recovery, incremental transmission and ancillary service-related charges incurred as a participant in the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. The PUCOs order applies to charges incurred from December 30, 2004, through January 1, 2006, and
authorizes the companies to accrue carrying charges on the deferral balances. The amount to be deferred will reflect actual incremental expenses, including line losses and carrying charges. In a separate case, pending before the PUCO, the companies propose to begin recovery of these incremental costs on January 1, 2006, through a tariff rider, which also would amortize the deferred balance over five years.
On July 22, we filed a settlement stipulation reached with various parties including the Ohio Consumers Counsel and the PUCO staff that provides for the requested recovery. If the settlement stipulation is approved by the PUCO, the actual amounts to be recovered in 2006 will be submitted to the PUCO on or before November 1, 2005.
On May 25, 2005, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a stipulated settlement agreement resolving the Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L) Phase II rate case filing, and a second stipulated settlement agreement resolving the motion for reconsideration of the 2003 decision in the JCP&L Phase I rate proceeding. The stipulated agreements are expected to increase JCP&Ls annual revenues by $51.1 million and result in a net annual earnings per share impact of approximately $0.12 per share. For 2005, the total impact is expected to be approximately $0.11 per share, which includes a $0.06 per share increase from revenues commencing on June 1 of this year and a one-time benefit of $0.05 per share from the creation of a new regulatory asset associated with accelerated tree trimming costs expensed in 2003 and 2004.
On May 27, 2005, FirstEnergys Ohio utility operating companies filed a request with the PUCO to establish a generation charge adjustment factor (GCAF) rider, as permitted under the Rate Stabilization Plan. The filing reflects projected increases in fuel and related costs in 2006 compared with 2002 costs. The companies request the tariff rider be implemented on January 1, 2006. Based on projected fuel costs and 2006 Ohio retail sales to which the GCAF rider will apply, the estimated revenue from the implementation of this rider is approximately $93 million in 2006.
Rating Agency Actions
On May 16, 2005, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services revised its outlook on FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries to "positive" from "stable" and affirmed its 'BBB-' corporate credit ratings on the companies. Standard & Poors stated that the outlook revision and rating affirmation reflect the successful restart of the Perry and Beaver Valley nuclear stations after their respective refueling outages.
On July 18, 2005, Moody's Investors Service changed its ratings outlook on FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries to "positive" from "stable", citing the companies improved finances and utility operations. FirstEnergys senior unsecured rating by Moodys is Baa3.
Intra-System Generation Asset Transfers
In May 2005, Ohio Edison Company (OE), The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), The Toledo Edison Company (TE), and Pennsylvania Power Company entered into certain agreements implementing a series of intra-system generation asset transfers, required under the restructuring plans approved in Ohio and Pennsylvania. When concluded, these transfers will result in the respective undivided ownership interests of the above utilities in FirstEnergys nuclear, fossil and hydroelectric plants being owned by FirstEnergy subsidiaries, FirstEnergy Nuclear Generation Corp., a new Ohio corporation, and FirstEnergy Generation Corp., respectively, separate and apart from the above utility subsidiaries. The generating plant interests that are being transferred do not include interests of CEI, TE and OE in certain of the plants that are currently subject to sale and leaseback arrangements with unaffiliated third parties.
Record Generation Output
FirstEnergy set a new generation output record of 19.1 million MWhs in the second quarter and 37.9 million MWhs for the first six months of the year. The output record was attributable to the outstanding performance of our generation fleet, particularly the 2,360 MW Bruce Mansfield Plant, which operated at a 97.4% availability factor for the six-month period.
 
On May 3, 2005, FirstEnergys Sammis Unit 2 became the longest-running single-turbine steam generating unit in the nations history when it surpassed a continuous-operation record of 819 days.

New Credit Facility
On June 14, 2005, FirstEnergy and certain of its subsidiaries, including all of its operating utility subsidiaries, entered into a new five-year syndicated credit facility totaling $2 billion. The new facility replaced FirstEnergys $1 billion and $375 million three-year credit agreements, as well as OE's $125 million three-year credit agreement and $250 million two-year credit agreement, which expired in May 2005. Borrowings under the facility must be repaid within 364 days. Available amounts for each borrower are subject to a specified sublimit as well as applicable regulatory and other limitations.
 
Nuclear Plant Update
On April 28, 2005, Beaver Valley Unit 2 returned to service following a scheduled refueling outage. Major work included replacement of fuel assemblies and a thorough inspection of the reactor vessel head and under-vessel, which were found to be in good condition.
On May 6, 2005, the Perry Plant returned to service following a scheduled refueling outage. The scope of the outage was increased by about 30% to enhance plant reliability, including work on the main generator, refurbishment of high-voltage breakers and modification of the emergency diesel generators exhaust system.
On May 20, 2005, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) announced the return of Davis-Besse to the standard oversight process, effective July 1, 2005, augmented to include inspections supporting the NRCs start-up order of March 8, 2004.
On July 8, 2005, the NRC issued their 95003 inspection report on the Perry plant. The inspection report concluded that Perry is being operated safely, however, the NRC will continue to provide increased oversight as FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company continues to implement Perrys Performance Improvement Initiative.

EXHIBIT 99.3
Based on its solid second quarter 2005 earnings and continued improvement in operational and financial performance, FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) announced today that it is raising its annual earnings guidance (non-GAAP)
(*)
for 2005 by $0.15 cents per share to $2.85 to $3.00 per share. Earnings guidance of $2.70 to $2.85 per share, excluding unusual items, was initially set on November 30, 2004. In addition, the company is increasing its cash flow guidance for 2005 and issuing annual earnings and cash flow guidance for 2006.
"By continuing to focus on our key objectives - maximizing the contribution of our generating plants, reinvesting in our business, enhancing financial strength and flexibility, and delivering consistent financial results - we are in a position to raise 2005 earnings and cash flow guidance and to issue 2006 guidance at this time," said Anthony J. Alexander, president and chief executive officer of FirstEnergy.
The upward revision of 2005 earnings guidance is primarily attributable to favorable regulatory decisions in Ohio and New Jersey; reduced operating expenses; a reduction in depreciation expenses due to the extension of the estimated service lives of the company's fossil generation units; lower pension and other employee benefits costs; and the favorable operating performance of its generation fleet.
As a result of the companys strong operating performance in the first half of the year and cash generated from an electricity prepayment program called Energy for Education II, the company now estimates 2005 free cash flow (non-GAAP) of $535 million and 2005 cash
2
generation (non-GAAP) of $620 million, up from previous estimates of $425 million and $560 million, respectively.
3
Also today, the company announced earnings guidance for 2006 of $3.40 to $3.60 per share of common stock, excluding unusual items. The company is currently unaware of any specific unusual charges or credits that will become reconciling items between earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in 2006.
The 2006 guidance reflects anticipated growth in the companys energy delivery business, increased generation margins, and a net reduction in Ohio transition cost amortization. It also reflects increased costs associated with a planned outage at its Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station to install a new steam generator and replace the reactor vessel head on Unit 1.
The company expects to generate net cash from operating activities (GAAP) in excess of $2 billion in 2006, with free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $280 million to $380 million after capital expenditures and common stock dividends, and cash generation (non-GAAP) of approximately $300 million to $400 million, as shown below:
The estimate for 2006 includes capital spending of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion, which is an increase of up to $100 million above our expected capital spending in 2005.
4
Details on the companys 2005 and 2006 earnings guidance will be provided during the companys earnings conference call, scheduled today at 1:00 p.m., (EDT). Briefings on the companys strategies, operations and financial outlook also will be provided. Supplemental information is included in the July 27, 2005, letter addressed to the investment community, which is posted on the Investor Information section of FirstEnergys Web site,

TO THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY:

As detailed in todays attached news release, FirstEnergy Corp. raised its earnings and cash flow guidance for 2005 and announced its 2006 earnings and cash flow guidance. This letter provides additional details concerning these announcements.
 
2005 Earnings Guidance
FirstEnergy issued 2005 earnings guidance of $2.70 to $2.85 per share, excluding unusual items, on November 30, 2004 (see the Letter to the Investment Community dated November 30, 2004 for additional details, available at www.firstenergycorp.com\ir). Since that time, the company has experienced favorable operating performance of its generation portfolio, lower pension and other employee benefit costs, reduced operating expenses, and a reduction in depreciation expense due to the extension of the estimated service lives of its fossil generation units.
Also, in May 2005 we received regulatory orders in Ohio and New Jersey that provide positive financial impacts in 2005 that were not reflected in our original earnings guidance:

Partially offsetting these favorable developments have been unanticipated replacement power and O&M costs resulting from a 26-day forced outage at the Perry nuclear plant and the extension of the subsequent scheduled Perry refueling outage.
Combined, these developments allow us to revise our 2005 earnings guidance to $2.85 to $3.00 per share, excluding unusual items, as detailed in the following table.
 
Attached to this letter is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of our revised 2005 earnings guidance.
With normalized non-GAAP earnings in the first two quarters of 2005 of $1.18 per share, we estimate that the remaining earnings for the year, excluding unusual items, will be allocated approximately 55% in the third quarter and 45% in the fourth quarter.
2005 Cash Flow Guidance
In our first quarter 2005 earnings release, we estimated free cash flow (non-GAAP) of $425 million and, after reflecting miscellaneous asset sales and other items, total cash generation (non-GAAP) of $560 million.
During the second quarter - through an electricity prepayment program called Energy for Education II - our Ohio operating companies received electric service prepayments that will have a net 2005 prepayment benefit of approximately $220 million. This program involved the Ohio Schools Councils ("OSC") pre-paying the electric bills of schools in return for discounts on their electricity service during the next three years. The OSC is a consortium of school districts in northern Ohio and the program benefited 249 districts.
Coupled with other operating and working capital changes, we now estimate our 2005 free cash flow (non-GAAP) to be $535 million and our 2005 cash generation (non-GAAP) at $620 million. Attached to this letter is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of our revised cash flow guidance.

The company continues to project net debt reduction of $600 million during the year, which should result in a debt to total capital ratio of about 55% at year-end. Cash availability above our guidance level would result from the release of collateral when the company gains an investment-grade rating for senior unsecured debt from Standard & Poor's (S&P). Additional cash resources could also become available through the anticipated JCP&L securitization, although the timing of this is uncertain.
2006 Earnings Guidance
We are establishing our 2006 earnings guidance, excluding unusual items, of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. This increase reflects the net impact of a variety of regulatory and operating items in comparison to our revised 2005 earnings guidance. We are currently unaware of any specific unusual items or credits that will become reconciling items between earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in 2006. The following table reconciles the increase from the mid-point of our revised 2005 earnings guidance ($2.93) to the mid-point of our 2006 earnings guidance ($3.50).

2006 Cash Flow Guidance
We are establishing our estimated 2006 free cash flow (non-GAAP) guidance at a range of $280 million to $380 million and our 2006 cash generation (non-GAAP) guidance at a range of $300 million to $400 million. These guidance amounts reflect $2.1 billion of net cash from operating activities (GAAP), which is up slightly from the guidance level in 2005. Attached to this letter is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of our 2006 cash flow guidance.
The following table reconciles our estimated 2005 free cash flow to our estimated 2006 free cash flow.
 
 
Our 2006 cash flow guidance includes estimated capital expenditures within a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We will finalize our 2006 capital-spending program this fall as we complete our budgeting process, which will prioritize capital projects and review our air quality control compliance strategy. We will provide investors with additional details about our 2006 capital spending plans later this year.
As mentioned previously, cash availability could be increased above our guidance range from the release of approximately $120 million of collateral when the Company regains its investment grade credit rating for unsecured debt from S&P and through the anticipated JCP&L securitization of up to $277 million.
Longer-Term EPS Growth Rate
Our longer-term annual EPS growth rate target of 3% to 4% remains unchanged. We believe this target is achievable through:

Summary
Throughout this year we have emphasized several key areas of management focus:
We have made substantial financial and operating progress over the recent past and believe that we will achieve levels of performance that will provide additional value for our investors.
