Akron, OH - FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today issued a comprehensive report to shareholders regarding air emissions regulations and an assessment of the companys future risks and mitigation efforts. The report is available on the companys Web site at
www.firstenergycorp.com/environmental
.
As one of the nations leading energy companies, we are committed to protecting the environment while meeting our customers needs for safe, reliable electricity, said Richard R. Grigg, FirstEnergy executive vice president and chief operating officer. We are pleased to offer our shareholders and customers this review of our past environmental accomplishments and plans to make significant additional emissions reductions.
FirstEnergys
Air Issues Report
was compiled at the request of  the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the Marianist Province of the United States, which hold FirstEnergy stock. The report recognizes that the debate surrounding issues such as global climate change may lead to new requirements in the years ahead.
The commitment of FirstEnergy to full environmental disclosure and reporting provides valuable information and assures stockholders, customers and stakeholders that the company is addressing climate change in a serious way, said William Somplatsky-Jarman, Mission Responsibility Through Investment Committee of the Presbyterian Church (USA).
With our substantial component of non-emitting nuclear plants - which provided nearly 40 percent of the electricity we produced last year - we believe that we are positioned better than many others to compete in a carbon-constrained world, Grigg said. In addition, we are actively engaged in research and development efforts and public policy discussions surrounding the issue of climate change.
Over the next five years, FirstEnergy expects to spend approximately $50 million on products, programs and activities that will help reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions or intensity and contribute to the development of technologies and solutions that help address climate change. These are expected to include:
 
In addition, FirstEnergy anticipates spending approximately $50 million on nuclear plant capacity uprates that will add 172 megawatts (MW) to its non-emitting generating capacity, license renewals for six nuclear and hydroelectric facilities, and contracts for 210 MW of additional wind power.
 
FirstEnergy is a diversified energy company headquartered in Akron, Ohio. Its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, as well as energy management and other energy-related services. Its seven electric utility operating companies comprise the nations fifth largest electric system, based on 4.5 million customers served within a 36,100 square-mile area of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.

Im pleased to offer our shareholders the following assessment of our environmental record and the steps were taking to meet increasingly stringent regulations in the future.
 
As one of the nations leading energy companies, FirstEnergy is committed to protecting the environment while meeting our customers needs for reliable and affordable electricity. We achieve these objectives by effectively managing the environmental impact of our activities; using natural resources wisely; improving our environmental performance; and supporting research on environmental technologies.
 
We take pride in our environmental achievements. For example:
 
 
 
 
 
As we work to achieve additional reductions in emissions, we also recognize that the debate surrounding issues such as global climate change  what many call global warming  may lead to new requirements in the years ahead.
 
We believe specific targets for carbon dioxide (CO
2
) reductions should be driven by proven, commercially available technologies. Toward that end, we remain active in collaborative projects such as CoalFleet for Tomorrow and the Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP) that should help our industry develop cost-effective CO
2
technologies while meeting our nations growing electricity needs.
 
We also believe that solutions should be comprehensive and global  not fractured and segmented by industry or country. Without a global approach that focuses on all sources of CO
2
emissions, regulations may lead to higher electric rates and potential supply shortages in the U.S. with no commensurate benefits to the environment.
 
No matter what regulatory framework we face, FirstEnergys diverse mix of generating resources  with our significant component of non-emitting nuclear capacity  places us in a strong position to meet future requirements. And we will continue to operate those resources in an environmentally sound manner while meeting the energy needs of the customers were privileged to serve.
 
We hope you view the following report as both an expression of that commitment and a blueprint to achieve environmental excellence.
 
Sincerely,

Global climate change is an issue that has received increasing attention recently, particularly related to the role human activity may play through emissions of CO
2
and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). Any response should acknowledge the need for global actions and will require the concerted efforts of different economic sectors. Clearly, it is not just an issue for our country or our industry to address.
 
 
Fleet Modernization
 
At FirstEnergy, fleet modernization has been a key strategy for achieving continuing emission reductions and will be central to our ability to continue meeting new, more stringent requirements. The following activities have helped diversify our generation fleet and minimize risk associated with future regulations:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Today's FirstEnergy
 
Today, FirstEnergy owns and operates 20 power plants located in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Jersey, with a combined generating capacity of 13,387 MW.
 
In 2004, 39.7 percent of the electricity generated by these plants came from non-emitting nuclear units, while approximately 59.9 percent was generated from coal. The remaining 0.4 percent came from hydroelectric, natural gas and oil units.
 
Since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, FirstEnergy has added low-NOx burners to 20 units, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) equip-ment to
3 units, Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) equipment to 5 units, and repowered a unit with a circulating fluidized bed boiler. In addition, we have increased our reliance on low-sulfur Eastern and Powder River Basin coals.
 
 
Investments and Innovation
 
In total, FirstEnergy companies have spent more than $5 billion on pollution controls and environ-mental systems since 1970. And these invest-ments have resulted in significant emission reductions.
 
Between 1990 and 2004:
 
 
 
At the same time, customer usage has increased by more than 10 percent.
 
Issued December 1, 2005                                                                               iii                                                                                          Air Issues Report
The companys largest plant, the 2,360-MW Bruce Mansfield Plant in Shippingport, PA, is fully equipped with flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment  also known as scrubbers  which removes some 92 percent of SO
2
, and SCR equipment, helping to meet regulatory requirements for NOemissions. Over the next few years, the plants scrubber systems will be upgraded to increase SO
x
2
removal to about 95 percent.
 
An example of the companys approach to environmental stewardship is its innovative Forced Oxidation Gypsum (FOG) project, a $30-million recycling facility at the Mansfield Plant that converts calcium sulfite  a byproduct of the plants scrubber systems  into commercial-grade gypsum.
 
Launched in 1999, the FOG facility currently recycles nearly half-a-million tons of calcium sulfite each year, reducing the need for land-filling. The companys partner in this project, National Gypsum, built an $85-million drywall facility adjacent to the plant to take advantage of this low-cost raw material. FirstEnergy currently is expanding the FOG facility to nearly triple its recycling capability and output, and further reduce the companys need to dispose of waste from its scrubber systems while expanding employment opportunities and investment in our local communities.
 
The FOG project is just one example of the leadership role FirstEnergys utility companies have maintained in the development of clean-coal technologies designed to support the continued use of coal  our nations most abundant energy resource while reducing air emissions. For more than two decades, FirstEnergy companies have been actively involved in efforts to accelerate the deployment of advanced clean-coal generating technologies and ensure their commercial availability.
 
During this time, the companies have partici-pated in some 15 clean-coal technology projects, with
a total cost of more than $430 million. These projects were implemented through funding collaborations with various government and industry groups, including U.S. Environ-mental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Ohio Coal Develop-ment Office (OCDO), Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Gas Research Institute.
 
The latest effort, a partnership with New Hampshire-based Powerspan Corp., resulted in the commercial development of a multi-pollutant control technology called Electro-Catalytic Oxidation (ECO
) that has been proven effective in reducing NOx, SO
2
, mercury, acid gases, and fine particulates. The ECO system also produces an ammonium sulfate co-product, which can be sold into the fertilizer market.
 
This seven-year effort to develop ECO from the laboratory to commercial availability was con-ducted at FirstEnergys R.E. Burger Plant near Shadyside, Ohio. The OCDO was a key sponsor of this project. Recently, FirstEnergy announced its intentions to install ECO on Unit 4 of its Bay Shore Plant in Oregon, Ohio. Design engineering is expected to begin in early 2006.
 
FirstEnergy and Powerspan also recently announced plans to conduct a pilot test of a promising CO
2
removal technology at the Burger Plant. The technology, called ECO
2
, can be readily integrated with the ECO system.
 
 
Continuing Improvement
 
In light of pending regulations issued earlier this year, such as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), these developments could be key to the compliance efforts of generators across the country.
 
CAIR calls for the most significant reductions of SO
2
and NOx in more than a decade. In total, 28 states, including all four where FirstEnergy has generating facilities  Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Jersey  will be required to achieve emission reductions over two phases. Phase I requires that NOx emissions be reduced 53 percent from 2003 levels by 2009 and SO
2
emissions be reduced 45 percent from 2003 levels by 2010.
 
CAMR, the first federal regulation of mercury emissions, also will be implemented in two phases, with the first beginning in 2010 and capping emissions at 38 tons, about 20 percent below current levels; and the second beginning in 2018 and capping emissions at 15 tons, a 70-percent reduction from current levels.
 
FirstEnergy already has committed to spending $1.5 billion on environmental improvements by 2012 at generating facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania. This investment, which involves installing new emission controls at the companys 2,233-MW W.H. Sammis Plant in Stratton, Ohio, as well as achieving reductions
at other facilities, will build on the significant progress already made in reducing emissions and represent an important step in complying with the new CAIR and CAMR rules.
 
 
Issued December 1, 2005                                                                               iv                                                                                           Air Issues Report
 
Both CAIR and CAMR rules would incorporate a cap-and-trade approach similar to that used as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This market-based trading system allows generating facilities the flexibility to achieve emission reduction targets, or caps, in the most economical manner possible. Cap-and-trade programs offer several advantages over the traditional command-and-control approach, which prescribed maximum allowable emissions by company and facility. In addition to greater flexibility and lower-cost compliance, cap-and-trade programs provide incentives to develop new technologies and greater certainty that environmental goals will be met through permanent caps on emissions.
 
The states will play a key role in CAIR and CAMR through implementation of the cap-and trade programs. Under these federal rules, states will be required to file new or updated State Implementation Plans (SIPs), which will set emission caps for SO
2
, NO and mercury, and allocate to generators tradable allowances that can be used to achieve compliance with the new rules. In addition, several states, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, have announced plans to require mercury reductions at generating facilities in their states.
x
 
While there is significant support for cap-and-trade programs, opinions vary on how to allocate these valuable allowances. Under the previous cap-and-trade programs, an input-based approach was used, with allowances being allocated based on the amount of fuel consumed by the affected sources. This provided allowances only to emitting generators, giving an economic advantage to these sources, and disadvantaging low- and non-emitting sources. An output-based, generation-neutral methodology would allocate allowances based on megawatt-hours (MWh) produced, providing an incentive for the development of lower-emitting generators. We believe the output-based, generation-neutral approach would level the playing field for both existing and new generators and encourage environmental efficiency.
 
Climate Change: Challenges
 
and Opportunities
 
Greenhouse gas-induced climate changes present unique challenges to policymakers and regulators charged with balancing environmental, economic and energy concerns. Unlike SO
2
and NO, there is no commercially available technology to capture and sequester CO
x
2
from power plants.
 
In preparation for this report, we completed the first comprehensive inventory of our systems direct and indirect GHGs. FirstEnergy facilities are responsible for approximately two percent of the CO
2
emitted by the U.S. electric utility industry  and just about one-tenth of one percent of total GHGs worldwide.
 
FirstEnergys GHG emissions primarily consist
of CO
2
, sulfur hexafluoride (SF
6
), nitrous oxide (N
2
O), methane (CH
4
), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Of these, all but SF
6
and HFCs are created during the combustion of fossil fuels. SF
6
is used as an insulating gas in the transmission and distribution system, and HFCs are used in building and vehicle air-conditioning systems.
 
We already have made significant voluntary reductions of CO
2
and other GHGs. According to reports made to the DOE, these efforts have resulted in average annual reductions of 8.9 million tons of CO
2
equivalent through improved operating efficiencies, uprates at our nuclear plants, reductions in SF
6
emissions, tree planting and reduced business travel. In the 14 years that we have reported our progress,
we have reduced some 125 million tons of 
CO
2
equivalent.
 
Our voluntary efforts include:
 
 
 
Issued December 1, 2005                                                                                   v                                                                                         Air Issues Report
 
 
 
Previous actions such as the retirement of older, coal-based power plants and investments in
non-emitting nuclear generation have worked to mitigate future risk related to GHG reduction requirements. In fact, our 3,795 MW of nuclear generation allow the company to avoid emitting about 25 million tons of CO
2
, 166,000 tons of SO
2
, and 62,000 tons of NOx annually.
 
FirstEnergy expects to spend approximately $50 million over the next five years on products, programs and activities that will help reduce GHG emissions or intensity in the near-to-mid term and contribute to the development of technologies and solutions in the long term to help our nation address the issue of climate change. These investments will focus on the following areas:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, FirstEnergy anticipates spending approxi-mately $50 million over the next five years to support relicensing and capacity uprates at its non-emitting generating plants, and renewable energy development. These investments will include:
 
 
 
 
The company expects, through the continuation of a variety of initiatives, to see a leveling of annual CO
2
emissions from its power plants through 2020, and a slight decline in the intensity of CO
2
emissions (the amount emitted per MWH produced) during the same period.
 
Recent analysis of proposed GHG regulations conducted by DOEs Energy Information Administration, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Charles River Associates  based on modeling of the impact of the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act of 2003  indicates that FirstEnergys cost to comply would be lower than our peers in the region.
 
While FirstEnergy is the third-largest electricity producer in the region that includes the East Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement (ECAR) and PJM Interconnection, we would have one of the lowest costs to comply with CO
2
reductions, due in large part to our significant nuclear generating capacity.
 
Even with a relatively low risk profile compared with our peers in the region, FirstEnergy is continuing to manage risks through additional voluntary reduction efforts, operating improve-ments and support for research and development.
 
Paving the Way for the Future
 
FirstEnergy believes it is important to remain actively involved in the discussion of climate change and work toward a reasoned approach for our industry.
 
Issued December 1, 2005                                                                                   vi                                                                                         Air Issues Report
As we stated earlier, we are participating in a research effort that will test a carbon capture process developed by Powerspan Corp. at our R.E. Burger Plant beginning in 2006. This process, which achieved 90-percent removal in laboratory testing, can be integrated into Powerspans ECO multi-pollutant technology. The pilot test also is supported by a research
and development agreement between Powerspan and DOE.
 
We also support EPRI research initiatives such as CoalFleet for Tomorrow, Future Coal Genera-tion Options, Global Climate Policy Costs and Benefits, Greenhouse Gas Reduction Options, Advanced Nuclear Research, and Electric Transportation Program.
 
While regulations of GHGs are certain to impact customer prices, it is difficult to estimate that effect. What is clear, however, is that GHG compliance costs would affect all generating units in our region. And, because FirstEnergy operates in three states likely to be fully deregu-lated by the time any reductions may be required, prices would be market-based and reflect the costs for compliance across the region, not just on our system.
 
To help quantify this impact, our report includes a discussion of three evaluations we conducted using different CO
2
emission allowance price scenarios  low ($10/ton of CO
2
), middle ($25/ton CO
2
) and high ($50/ton CO
2
). These price scenarios are based on different potential compliance options, including the use of capture and sequestration technologies currently under development, the conversion of existing coal units to natural gas, and a CO
2
tax. Based on these evaluations, costs to comply with CO
2
reductions could range from less than one cent per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to 4.5 cents per kWh.
 
 
Our Report to Shareholders
 
FirstEnergy developed this report in response to shareholder proposals received December 3, 2004, from the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the Marianist Province of the United States. The proposals, which were withdrawn following
our decision to issue a report, requested an
assess-ment of current and future risks associated with CO
2
and other air emissions.
 
This report is intended to provide shareholders
with information on challenges and opportunities
the company may face in a carbon-constrained environment. As we have in the past, we will
balance the needs of our customers, shareholders
and communities in addressing these issues,
while maintaining our commitment to producing electricity in an environmentally responsible manner.
 
FirstEnergy's
Air Issues Report
was compiled by
a company task force led by the vice president
of Environmental with oversight from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The report also was reviewed by the Environ-men-tal Steering Committee representing the companys senior officers and led by the Chief Operating Officer.

Chapter

: Introduction
FirstEnergys core mission is to meet the growing needs of its customers for reliable, affordable electricity. As we pursue this goal, we also must meet increasingly stringent environmental requirements and deliver adequate return to our shareholders. We have an obligation to our customers whose lives, livelihoods and quality of life depend in part on electricity. We have an obligation to be responsible stewards of the environment and to continue the significant air-quality progress weve been making for decades. And, we have an obligation to our shareholders to be prudent in our decision making and successful in our financial performance.
 
FirstEnergy takes all three of these responsibilities seriously.
 
While we have a strong record of environmental compliance, much work will need to be done to comply with future environmental regulations. More stringent regulations aimed at additional reductions of NOx and SO
2
, as well as new mercury regulations, already are being implemented. CO
2
and other GHG emissions have been addressed by Congress in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. At the same time, demand for electricity continues to grow across the country and is expected to rise 49 percent by 2025.
1
 
FirstEnergy believes that, in order to continue providing reliable, affordable electricity in an environmentally sound manner, we need to plan carefully to meet any new requirements.
 
Global climate change  what many call global warming  has received increasing attention for the last several years, particularly with respect to the role human activity may play in contributing to the warming effect through emissions of CO and other GHGs. This report does not attempt to analyze differing scientific opinions about climate change. Rather, it acknowledges that there is a growing scientific concern about climate change and seeks to provide an assessment of the impact GHG reductions may have on FirstEnergy, its customers and shareholders.
2
 
Any discussion of climate change needs to begin with an understanding that while there are ways to reduce GHG emissions through improved operating efficiencies and enduse efficiencies, there currently are no cost-effective ways to make the kinds of significant reductions the electricity industry has achieved for SO and NOx without the development of control technology to capture and sequester CO emissions from existing coal-based power plants. Consequently, there is no consensus on the most appropriate solutions  or the proper time frames for addressing the issue.
2

This report was compiled to provide information to our shareholders on the assumptions and analyses that are shaping FirstEnergys actions in response to global climate change, and to document those actions.
 
Climate Change: Global and Economywide
 
Using data from the DOE and World Resources Institute, it can be shown that FirstEnergy facilities are responsible for approximately two percent of the CO emitted by the U.S. utility industry  and just one-tenth of one percent of total GHG emissions worldwide. As a result, we believe public policies designed to minimize risk associated with CO and other GHGs should acknowledge two fundamental characteristics of climate change: (1) it is global in nature and (2) it involves many different sectors of domestic and international economies.
2

The Global Nature of Climate Change
Climate change is a global phenomenon  impacted by human activity worldwide  that requires a global solution. According to EPRI, if current trends continue, the amount of CO emissions in developing countries will surpass the amount of CO emissions in developed countries sometime in the next few decades. If countries CO emissions , but countries CO emissions continue to , total global emissions will continue to rise.

The effectiveness  and the associated costs  of any GHG reduction measures in the United States, whether voluntary or mandatory, will depend in part on actions taken in other nations around the globe. A climate change solution must involve broad global participation, by both developed and developing nations. Moreover, it will be critical for U.S. policy makers to give careful thought to the interaction of U.S. domestic climate change policy with international climate change policy.
 
The Economywide Nature
of Climate Change
 
Climate change involves all sectors of the economy and it will take a multi-sector approach to adequately address the issue. While the electricity sector may be the largest single contributor of GHGs in the U.S., there are many sources of GHGs, nationally and globally. According to the U.S. EPA, the electric power industry produces 33 percent of U.S. GHG emissions; transportation sources produce 27 percent; industrial sources produce 19 percent; and agricultural, commercial, residential, and other sources combined produce 21 percent. 
For example, the combined carbon equivalent emissions from transportation and other industry sources in the United States are larger than the carbon equivalent emissions from electricity generation sources.
2
 
 
Effective policy on climate change must, therefore, address sources
multiple
of CO and other GHG emissions, rather than just targeting individual sectors.
2
 
 
Guiding Principles for Climate Change Policy
 
Recognizing that climate change is global and economywide and that no cost-effective control technology to capture CO emissions from electric power plants currently exists - FirstEnergy believes addressing climate change requires comprehensive scientific and economic review. Development of a clear national policy on global climate change would help FirstEnergy to plan for the future. Whatever policy Congress considers should:

A Multi-Pronged
Investment Strategy
 
Technology Is the Key
Recognizing that technology is the key to responding to the global climate change challenge, FirstEnergy will focus much of our risk-mitigation efforts on supporting research and development into control technologies for new and existing power plants. While demand-side management and energy-efficiency improvements will help reduce GHG emissions, we believe that significant progress can only be achieved through technology development.
 
At FirstEnergy, we are committed to producing electricity in an environmentally responsible manner. Since the Clean Air Act of 1970 was passed, weve spent more than $5 billion to protect the environment  an investment that has resulted in significant reductions of SO
2
and NOx. Since 1990 alone, weve reduced SO
2
by 47 percent and NOx by 63 percent.
 
FirstEnergy similarly is committed to achieving future voluntary CO reductions through fuel diversity, terrestrial sequestration, increased use of renewables, energy efficiency programs and end-user electrotechnologies. In the absence of specific CO reduction targets or implementation time-lines, we are planning and acting thoughtfully and with foresight. We are investigating other opportunities to reduce our CO emissions  from efficiency improvements at our coal-based plants to uprates at our nuclear power plants.
2

2
 
Even with our fleet diversity, which includes non-emitting generation assets, FirstEnergy still relies heavily on coal to generate a large portion of the electricity needed to serve our customers. Coal-based electricity is abundant, reliable and less costly than most other sources of electricity; for those reasons, we will support the development of advanced technologies that allow us to continue to utilize coal as a significant part of our fuel mix.
 
Our major investments targeted at developing advanced coal technologies are focused in four general categories:
 
 
FirstEnergy has agreed to pilot test this new ECO technology integrated with the ECO unit at our R.E. Burger Plant in 2006. The pilot is expected to capture approximately 20 tons of CO per day. We believe ECO technology could be economically applied to existing power plants, thereby providing a potential option for continuing to operate our existing coal-based fleet in a carbon-constrained world. In addition, new ultra-supercritical pulverized coal plants with ECOtechnology could be economically equivalent or even preferable to Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) with CO capture for new coal-based power plants.

Global Climate Change:
Our Position
 
Ultimately, policy makers will determine how global climate change is addressed, and we will comply with those regulations. We have taken a progressive approach in addressing air quality issues, making major investments and realizing significant air-quality improvements. We recognize the importance of being a responsible environmental steward, and we accept responsibility for managing that stewardship and continuing to improve our environmental performance.
 
Reducing GHGs will present unique challenges because of the nations heavy reliance on coal, the high cost of natural gas and the need to develop cost-effective technologies to capture and sequester CO
2
from the existing fleet of power plants. We support policies that expedite these developments, such as those contained in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
 
FirstEnergys risk in a carbon constrained world is significantly mitigated by our substantial non-emitting nuclear capacity  which generates approximately 40 percent of the electricity we produce. This non-emitting capacity will play a key role in meeting increasingly stringent and expansive air-quality and emissions standards. And our substantial investments in clean coal technologies will help support the continued use of abundant domestic supplies of low cost coal to meet the nations need for reliable, affordable electricity.
 
Climate change compliance efforts would be expected to be reflected in the price of electricity. If all electricity providers are held to the same standards, costs associated with CO constraints ultimately will be born by customers in both regulated and competitive markets. In competitive markets, such as the three states where FirstEnergy operates  Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey  we expect that the market will reflect the added cost in the price of generation. In regulated environments, costs likely will be part of regulated rates.
2
 
The cost to address global climate change could vary greatly, depending on time frames for compliance, levels of reductions, and technology developments, among other things. Of course, carbon costs will be lower for electricity customers if flexibility and trading are allowed, and if reasonable compliance schedules are imposed. A too rapid transition precludes the optimal use of next-generation advanced tech-nologies. And, if new emission standards are implemented too soon, not only will costs be higher but the benefits of the technology will be minimized. The key to whether GHG reductions can be achieved cost effectively lies in the timing of technology developments and the flexibility of compliance options. Without development of new carbon capture and sequestration technologies and flexibility such as cap-and-trade programs, the cost to reduce GHGs would be significant.

: FirstEnergy Profile and Background
 
Company Profile & Brief History
 
FirstEnergy Corp. is a diversified energy company headquartered in Akron, Ohio. Its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, as well as energy management and other energy-related services. Its seven electric utility operating companies comprise the nation's fifth largest investor owned electric system, serving 4.5 million customers within 36,100 square miles of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The company operates 20 power plants and approximately 135,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines. In 2004, FirstEnergy had nearly $12.5 billion in annual revenues and approximately $31 billion in assets.
 
FirstEnergy was formed from the 1997 merger of Ohio Edison Company (and its subsidiary, Pennsylvania Power Company) and the former Centerior Energy Corporation, which itself was formed in 1986 by the merger of Toledo Edison and The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. In 2001, FirstEnergy merged with the former GPU, Inc., which was a utility holding company for Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L), Metro-politan Edison (Met-Ed) and Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec).
 
FirstEnergys corporate vision is to be the leading retail energy and related services supplier in its region; the preferred choice for total customer solutions; shareholders choice
for long-term growth and investment value; and a company driven by the skills, diversity and character of its employees. This vision is supported by our commitment to protect the environment while meeting our customers needs for reliable, affordable electricity.
 
FirstEnergys Generation Portfolio
 
FirstEnergy operates 20 power plants with a total system capacity of 13,387 MW. Altogether, they produce an average of about 75 million MWh of electricity each year. These plants are capable of meeting the electricity needs of as much as 93 percent of our 3.4 million Pennsylvania and Ohio customers. Additional power is purchased from the Midwest Independent Transmission System (MISO) and the PJM Interconnection to match overall supply with demand. In New Jersey, power is procured for our 1.1 million JCP&L customers through the states annual auction.
 
The balance and diversity of FirstEnergys generation portfolio reflect one of the companys strategies for responding to the challenge of providing electricity to our customers while continually improving the environmental performance of our generation facilities.

Of FirstEnergys 13,387 MW of generating capacity:
 
 
 
 
 
 
More than half of FirstEnergys generation comes from non-emitting nuclear plants or scrubber-equipped coal-based units.
 
On average, 40 percent of the electricity we produce each year comes from our nuclear fleet. In 2004, for example, FirstEnergy produced 75 million MWh of electricity from its generation plants. Of this total, 45 million MWh (59.9 percent) was generated by coal-based plants  including 18.4 million MWh from the scrubber-equipped Bruce Mansfield Plant  and 29.9 million MWh (39.7 percent) was produced by nuclear plants that do not emit CO or criteria air pollutants (those regulated under the Clean Air Act). The remaining 0.4 percent came from hydroelectric, natural gas and oil units. The 29.9 million MWh of emissions free nuclear power produced in 2004 was a record for FirstEnergys nuclear fleet.
2
 
FirstEnergys nuclear plants play a key role in our efforts to limit overall emissions. For example, approximately one ton of CO is created per MWh of electricity generated from coal, and about three-quarters of a ton is created per MWh of electricity produced from natural gas when fired in a simple-cycle combustion turbine. As a result, our substantial nuclear generation capacity allows us to avoid emitting, on average, about 25 million tons of CO into the air annually that other wise would have been emitted if coal or gas-fired generation were used instead. We also are able to avoid emitting, on average, approximately 166,000 tons of SO and 62,000 tons of NOx annually. Our nuclear plants will play a similarly vital role in enabling us to respond to greenhouse gas initiatives in the future.
2

2
 
FirstEnergys balanced portfolio of fossil fuel and non-emitting generation also distinguishes the company among Midwest utilities. In Ohio, for example, more than 90 percent of electricity is generated from coal. As illustrated in the chart below, our air emissions are significantly lower than the regions average for Ohio.
 
Fleet Modernization as a Corporate Strategy
 
The composition of FirstEnergys generation fleet has evolved over several decades, with increased nuclear and natural gas generation and the shut-down of older coal-based units resulting in further diversification of the fuel sources used by the companys generating fleet. Todays generation mix, featuring a strong nuclear component in a balanced and diverse portfolio, reduces our risk associated with future environmental regulations and increasingly stringent emission standards  particularly those related to GHGs  while positioning the company to better meet growing customer demand for electricity. In this regard, our generation fleet is a valuable competitive and risk-mitigation advantage.

There have been several dimensions to the companys fleet modernization strategy during the last three decades, including the following:
 
 
FirstEnergy is committed to continued reliance on nuclear power for meeting its customers electricity needs and for helping to meet tougher air-quality standards. We are in the process of applying to renew the licenses of all four of our nuclear units, which, if approved by the NRC, would extend their service for another 20 years each. Three of the units currently operate under their original 40-year licenses, which were granted when the plants went online in 1976 (Beaver Valley 1), 1986 (Perry) and 1987 (Beaver Valley 2). Davis-Besse currently operates under a license that was modified by the NRC to allow 40 years of operation from the time the plant went online in 1977. (The original license for Davis-Besse was effective from the beginning of plant construction and, without modification, would have encompassed less than 40 years of operation.)
 
 
Since 1970, FirstEnergy companies have taken 57 older coal-based boilers, totaling nearly 1,900 MW, out of service. Together, these plants used more than three million tons of coal annually. It is estimated that as much as 65,000 tons of SO, 15,600 tons of NOx and 2.25 million tons of CO have been avoided annually by the shutdown of these boilers.
2
2
 
 
 
 
 
As we add balance to our generation portfolio, the net effect has been to reduce FirstEnergys reliance on coal, add environmental controls to the majority of our remaining coal-based units, and give us greater flexibility in mitigating the risk associated with evolving emission standards and future climate change regulations.

At the same time, our ongoing efforts to maintain the diversity of our fuel sources used for electric generation will continue to recognize coal as a key resource that will help us meet a growing demand for affordable electricity. Coal is our nations most abundant domestic fuel source for electricity generation, less costly than virtually all other fossil fuels, and  thanks to continuing advancements in clean coal technologies  increasingly clean. As such, coal will remain a significant component of FirstEnergys electric generation mix.
 
Clean-Coal Technology Leadership
 
For more than 20 years, FirstEnergy companies have been leaders in efforts to accelerate the deployment of advanced clean-coal generating technologies and support their commercial availability. FirstEnergy and its utility operating companies have participated in 15 clean coal technology projects, dating back to 1986 and including various partnerships with the U.S. EPA, DOE, OCDO/ Ohio Air Quality Development Authority, EPRI and Gas Research Institute. To date, FirstEnergy and its sponsoring partners have spent more than $430 million on the advancement of clean-coal technologies.
 
These investments, which are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3 of this report, have made it possible for utilities across the country to burn coal more cleanly  reducing emissions of criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gases  while helping to ensure that coal will continue to be a viable and significant source of reliable, affordable electricity well into the future.
 
And this work continues. FirstEnergy is participating in an EPRI effort known as CoalFleet for Tomorrow, which is evaluating the next generation of advanced coal power systems such as IGCC, fluidized bed combustion of waste coal, and ultra-supercritical boilers burning pulverized coal.
 
A Legacy of Emission Reductions
 
FirstEnergy has a strong environmental track record. We have made substantial investments  and these investments have yielded significant reductions in emissions. For example, since 1990 alone:
overall, FirstEnergy companies have spent more than $5 billion on environmental protection since 1970
 
 
 
 
 
Commitment to Ongoing Air Quality Investments
 
Looking to the future, FirstEnergy is expecting to spend $1.5 billion over the next several years in environmental systems that will significantly reduce emissions of SO, NOx and mercury at our power plants. Under this program, which establishes the foundation for achieving emission reductions called for in the U.S. EPAs Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), additional control equipment could be installed on nearly 5,500 MW of the companys 7,400 MW of coal-based generation.
2
 
Our obligation to our customers and to our shareholders calls for a reasonable, thoughtful and responsible plan of action in anticipation of such regulations. We believe this $1.5 billion commitment is a sound investment for the future. (The role this investment will play in FirstEnergys overall environmental risk mitigation strategy will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.)

Corporate Environmental Policy
 
As one of the nations leading energy companies, FirstEnergy is committed to protecting the environment while meeting our customers needs for a reliable and affordable source of electricity. We achieve this balance through a number of strategies and investments that will be discussed in detail in this chapter of the report.
 
FirstEnergys commitment to environmental protection is articulated in the companys Corporate Environmental Policy:
 
FirstEnergy is committed to providing energy and energy-related services to our customers in a manner that is consistent with environmental policies, laws, regulations and rules. We will achieve this objective by effectively managing the environmental impact of our activities, using natural resources wisely, improving our environmental performance, enhancing our environmental stewardship, and supporting research on environmental technologies.

Overall, FirstEnergy companies have spent more than $5 billion on environmental protection since the introduction of the Clean Air Act in 1970. As this chapter will document, these investments are paying substantial dividends in the form of significant, measurable air-quality improvements.
 
In addition to investments and actions designed to achieve the clean air objectives that constitute the primary focus of this report, FirstEnergy companies have a proud history of working with public and private interests on a variety of other environmental issues, including the preservation of wetlands, recycling byproducts from our operations, and maintaining our transmission corridors in a manner conducive to wildlife diversity.
 
As a company, we believe such programs not only benefit the environment, but also make good business sense.
 
Overview of Environmental Improvements
 
FirstEnergy reduces NOx, SO and mercury emissions from its coal-based power plants through a variety of means, including the use of flue gas desulfurization (FGD)  also called scrubbers  a circulating fluidized limestone bed, baghouses, electrostatic precipitators, blended coal, washed coal, low NOx burners, selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Following
2
is a summary list of specific major environmental improvements the company has made to generating units since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Also since 1990, FirstEnergy has achieved significant emission reductions by decommissioning older, coal-based boilers (discussed in more detail later in this report).
 
Its important to note that these emission reductions were achieved during a period in which net MWh produced from fossil-fuel generation in the FirstEnergy system actually by more than ten percent. This further underscores the significant advances we have made in the environmental efficiency of our generating processes and technologies.
increased
 
These emission reductions have helped FirstEnergy comply with new environmental regulations, including the U.S. EPA Acid Rain Program, which implemented Title IV of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, and NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call. Following is a detailed description of the emission reduction requirements for these two initiatives, as well as a summary of FirstEnergys compliance record with respect to each set of requirements.
 
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 - The Acid Rain Program
 
The overall goal of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 was to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of SO and NOx. To achieve this goal at the lowest possible cost, the U.S. EPAs Acid Rain Program employed both traditional and innovative, market-based approaches for controlling emissions, and also encouraged energy efficiency and emission avoidance. The flexibility regarding compliance options allowed under the program has been key to FirstEnergys ability to respond successfully to the programs emission reduction requirements with as little impact as possible on customer prices.
2
 
Compliance Options: Freedom
to Choose
 
The Acid Rain Program provides companies flexibility to select their own compliance strategies. For example, to reduce SO, a generating facility may switch to cleaner burning fuel or be repowered to utilize an alternate fuel. Companies also may decide to reduce electricity generation by adopting conservation or efficiency measures. Most options, such as fuel switching, require no special prior approval, allowing generators to respond quickly to market conditions without needing government approval. For NOx, the source may meet the performance standard on a utility unit basis,

enter into an emissions averaging plan, or apply
for an alternative emissions limitation.

In each of these cases, the program allows affected utilities to combine these and other options in ways they see fit to tailor their compliance plans to the unique needs of each unit or system, and to achieve the desired outcomes in the most cost-effective manner.
 
SO
2
Emission Reduction Requirements
 
The Acid Rain Program set a goal of reducing annual SO emissions by 10 million tons below 1980 levels. To achieve these reductions, the law required a two-phase tightening of the restrictions placed on fossil fuel-fired power plants:
2
 
 
 
Market-Based Allowance Trading System
 
In a dramatic departure from traditional command-and-control regulatory methods, which establish specific emission limitations with which all affected sources must comply, the Acid Rain Program introduced an allowance trading system that relies on the incentives of the free market to reduce pollution.
 
Under this system, affected utility units are allocated allowances based on their historic fuel consumption and a specific emission rate. Each allowance permits a unit to emit one ton of SO
2
during or after a specified year. For each ton of SO
2
emitted in a given year, one allowance is retired  that is, it can no longer be used.
 
Allowances may be bought, sold, or banked. Anyone may acquire allowances and participate in the trading system. However, regardless of the number of allowances a source holds, it may not emit SO at levels that would violate federal or state limits set under Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
2
 
The innovative, market-based SO allowance trading component of the Acid Rain Program allows utilities to adopt the most cost-effective strategy to reduce SO emissions at units in their systems. Affected utilities are required to install systems that continuously monitor emissions of SO, NOx and other related pollutants to track progress, ensure compliance, and provide credibility to the trading component of the program. In any year that compliance is not achieved, excess emissions penalties will be assessed, and sources either will have allowances deducted immediately from their accounts or may submit a plan to the U.S. EPA that specifies how the excess SO emissions will be offset.
2
2
2
2
 
Currently, under Phase II, utilities are allocated about 9.5 million allowances annually. The number of allowances will be reduced to a permanent ceiling, or cap, of 8.95 million annually beginning in 2010. The cap firmly restricts emissions and ensures that environmental benefits will be achieved and maintained.
 
Bonus Allowances
 
The SO emission allowance allocation for the Acid Rain Program was a key factor in at least partially alleviating concern about the high cost of compliance in certain states and regions due to new requirements. For each phase, bonus allowances were provided to certain units, although Phase II contains significantly more bonus allowance provisions than Phase I.

Many factors were considered in the allocation of bonus allowances, including the use of specific technologies; recognition for early reductions; low capacity factor in the baseline years; coal or other fuel type; whether states were non-attainment; previous fuel switching due to regulatory requirements; small unit size; low emission rate units or states; demonstration of advanced technology; and states with high population growth. It is notable that the many types of bonus allowances were for limited time periods.

FirstEnergys Compliance with
Current SO
2
Reduction Requirements
Phase II of the Acid Rain Programs SO reduction requirements began January 1, 2000, and annually requires FirstEnergy to achieve an additional 200,000 tons of SOreductions beyond Phase I goals. Compliance has been achieved by increased use of lower sulfur coal, scrubbers on all three units at our Bruce Mansfield Plant, and repowering Bay Shore Unit 1 using a technology called circulating fluidized bed combustion. In addition, we now generate more electricity from our lower or non-emitting plants. We also have shut down or placed on cold-standby older, less efficient coal-based units.

FirstEnergy participates in the SO allowance market as both a buyer and a seller. Since achieving Phase II compliance, FirstEnergys SOemission rate has steadily declined from 1.34 lbs./million British thermal units (mmBtu) in year 2000 to 1.21 lbs./ mmBtu in year 2004.

The current Acid Rain Program requirements for SO emission reductions will stay in effect until the start of Phase I of CAIR in 2010.

NOx Emission Reduction Requirements
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set a goal of reducing NOx emissions by 2 million tons from 1980 levels by 2000. The Title IV Acid Rain Program focuses on reducing emissions from one set of sources that emit NOx: coal-based electric utility boilers.
 
The NOx program embodies many of the same principles of the SO trading program. It has a results oriented approach, flexibility in the methods that can be used to achieve emission reductions, and program integrity through measurement of the emissions. However, the program does not cap NOx emissions as the SO program does, nor does it utilize an allowance trading system.
2
2
 
As with the SO emission reduction requirements, the NOx reduction program was implemented in two phases, beginning in 1996 and 2000, respectively.
2
 
 
 
In general, two options for compliance with the emission limitations were provided:
 
 
 
These options gave utilities flexibility to meet the emission limitations in a cost-effective way across all of their coal-based generating units and allowed for the further development of technologies to reduce the cost of compliance.
 
Ozone Regulations: The NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call
 
In October 1998, the U.S. EPA finalized the "Finding of Significant Contribution and Rule making for Certain States in the Ozone Transport Assessment Group Region for Purposes of Reducing Regional Transport of Ozone" (commonly called the NOx SIP Call). The NOx SIP Call required 22 states and the District of Columbia to reduce emissions of NOx, an ozone precursor, to reduce the out-of-state contribution to ground-level ozone pollution in the eastern United States. For states opting to meet the obligations of the NOx SIP Call through a cap-and-trade program, U.S. EPA included a model NOx Budget Trading Program rule (Part 96). This trading program was modeled after the Acid Rain Program SO trading system. It facilitates cost-effective emissions reductions of NOx from large stationary sources, and includes provisions for applicability, allocations, monitoring, banking, penalties, trading protocols and program administration.

NOx Budget Trading Program Allowances
As part of its responsibility to administer the NOx Budget Trading Program under the NOx SIP Call, the EPAs Clean Air Markets Division records allowance allocations in the NOx Allowance Tracking System (NATS) according to the specifications of each state. The requirements for recording allocations in NATS are: (1) the state has finalized its SIP, including its trading rules; (2) the SIP is approved by U.S. EPA; and (3) the state submits to the Clean Air Markets Division an electronic file including account specific allocation amounts.
 
Ohio NOx SIP Call
In response to U.S. EPAs NOx SIP Call, Ohio EPA finalized rules in July 2002 to establish the NOx Budget Trading Program in Ohio. Ohio EPAs rules established the NOx Budget Trading Program in Ohio to reduce NOx emissions from electrical generating utilities and large industrial boilers.
 
The NOx Budget Trading Program requires substantial reductions of NOx emissions for regulated units during the compliance period, which is May 1 through September 30 (sometimes referred to as the ozone season). In its NOx SIP Call, U.S. EPA set a cap on the total NOx emissions from regulated units in Ohio during the compliance period. The cap is Ohios NOx budget for regulated units and represents a 60- to 85-percent reduction of NOx emissions from these units compared to their historical averages. Beginning in 2004, and for each following year, regulated units receive an allocation of NOx allowances from Ohios NOx budget. Each NOx allowance represents permission to emit one ton of NOx emissions. At the end of each control period, NOx allowances available to each regulated unit must equal or exceed the tons of NOx emissions from the unit during the control period. How this is done is left up to the units owner. The owner can install NOx control equipment, reduce hours of operation, or purchase NOx allowances on the open market.
 
Pennsylvania NOx SIP Call
Pennsylvania's NOx reduction program was adopted in 1994, and the second phase of the program, including emissions trading, was implemented in 1999. Resulting emissions of NOx from affected sources in 1999 were reduced 60 percent from 1990 levels. Pennsylvania's Chapter 145 regulations, the response to EPA's NOx SIP Call, improved on the market-based trading program. Pennsylvanias current Interstate Ozone Transport Reduction regulation in Chapter 145 of the Pennsylvania Code established requirements beginning in 2003 for:
 
 
 
The current cap-and-trade program allocates NOx allowances during the period of May 1 through September 30 and establishes an accounting process for deposit, use and transfer of allowances between NOx budget sources. Affected Pennsylvania sources are required to meet a standard of 0.23 lbs. NOx/mmBtu. Similar sources that are not otherwise covered may optin in order to participate in the cap-and-trade program.
 
New Jersey NOx SIP Call
FirstEnergy owns two generating facilities in New Jersey  Forked River, an 86-MW combustion turbine, and half of the output of Yards Creek, a 400-MW pumped-storage hydroelectric facility. Forked River  the companys only combustion source in the state  has two dual-fuel combustion turbines that incorporate water injection systems to control NOx. FirstEnergy receives NOx allowances annually from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) for these units. Because New Jersey has deregulated its generation business, the regional cost of NOx compliance is reflected in the market-based price for electricity.
 
FirstEnergys Compliance with
Current NOx Reduction Requirements
Phase II of the Title IV Acid Rain NOx reduction program began January 1, 2000. Low-NOx combustion equipment has been installed on our most cost-effective units, and we currently are in full compliance with the Phase II NOx rules. Since achieving Phase II compliance, FirstEnergys NOxemission rate has steadily declined from 0.48 lbs./mmBtu in year 2000 to 0.33 lbs./mmBtu in year 2004.
 
 
Also, Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires significant NOx reductions from May through September (the ozone season) on most units for ozone attainment reasons.Essentially, an 85-percent NOx reduction was required beginning with 2003 in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and beginning May 31, 2004, in Ohio and Michigan. FirstEnergy met these NOx reductions by operating a mix of control technologies, including SCR, SNCR, low-NOx burners, overfire air systems and fuel switching. We operated new SCRs on all three Pennsylvania coal-based units (Mansfield 1, 2, and 3) during the May through September ozone season in 2004 and 2005. We also operated SNCR systems installed on three of our Ohio coal-based units (Sammis Plant #2 and #7, and Eastlake Plant #3).

Case Study: Mansfield Power Plant Environmental Controls & FOG Recycling Project
 
FirstEnergys Bruce Mansfield Plant, located in Shippingport, Pennsylvania, is the largest coal-based electric generating plant in the state. It also is home to one of the largest recycling projects in North America. A $30-million recycling facility at the Mansfield power plant turns a typically unusable byproduct of the facility's FGD system, also known as a scrubber system, into commercial-grade gypsum used to produce wallboard.
 
The recycling process is called Forced Oxidation Gypsum, or FOG. Launched in 1999, the FOG plant, which is a separate facility on the Bruce Mansfield property, is the only one of its kind in the world.
 
The Mansfield Plants scrubber system, which removes 92 percent of the SO from the plant's emissions, works by spraying a liquid lime substance into the flue gas. The process creates a byproduct called calcium sulfite, which is normally disposed of in a landfill.
2
 
FirstEnergys partner in this unique recycling project is the National Gypsum Company, which built an $85-million drywall facility adjacent to the Mansfield Plant specifically to take advantage of the recycled gypsum. After the calcium sulfite is transformed into gypsum, an enclosed conveyer belt transports it from FirstEnergys FOG plant to National Gypsums drywall-production facility across the road.
 
FirstEnergy benefits from the FOG technology in two ways: (1) we generate additional revenue by selling the gypsum; and (2) we reduce our disposal costs.
 
National Gypsum benefits by being able to buy a less costly raw material and avoid shipping expenses. And, the environment benefits because the program reduces the amount of land disposal of calcium sulfite and the need to mine gypsum from the earth.
 
The Mansfield Plants FOG facility currently produces 450,000 tons per year of synthetic gypsum  using only about one-third of the total scrubber byproduct from the three generating units at the Mansfield Plant. Because of the successful operation of the FOG facility, FirstEnergy and National Gypsum have decided to increase the level of recycling at the plant. Construction began in April 2005 on a $50-million expansion of the FOG facility. When finished  construction is scheduled to be completed by June 2006  the expanded facility will have the capacity to convert nearly all of the calcium sulfite generated at the Mansfield Plant into more than a million tons of synthetic gypsum per year.
 
For its part, National Gypsum has agreed to purchase all of its requirements for synthetic gypsum from the company and to help FirstEnergy sell the excess that is produced by our expanded FOG facility. Currently, National Gypsum purchases additional gypsum from another source so it can operate its plant at full capacity.
 
The Mansfield Plants FOG facility is a textbook example of how innovation, collaboration and technology have combined to mitigate the environmental impact of FirstEnergys ongoing efforts to meet the growing demand for electricity.
 
 
Coal-based Plant Shutdowns
Another important dimension of FirstEnergys actions to reduce emissions is the companys decision to retire aging and less-efficient coal-based power plants in response to the Clean Air Act of 1970.
 
Since 1970, FirstEnergy companies have taken 57 older coal-based boilers, totaling nearly 1,900 MW, out of service. Together, these units used more than three million tons of coal annually.
 
During the 1970s and 1980s, FirstEnergy companies modernized its fleet by investing in more than 7,000 MW of generating capacity that either met all new source standards or was non-emitting nuclear generation. As noted in Chapter 2 of this report, FirstEnergys nuclear plants play a key role in our efforts to limit overall emissions. Today, approximately 40 percent of the electricity FirstEnergy produces comes from non-emitting, non-fossil-fuel sources. Our substantial nuclear generation capacity allows us to avoid emitting, on average, about 25 million tons of CO,166,000 tons of SO, and 62,000 tons of NOx that otherwise would be emitted annually if a regional mix of coal and natural gas-fired generation were used instead. The strategic value of our nuclear fleet will only increase with the implementation of the U.S. EPAs new CAIR for electric generating plants and CAMR rules for coal-based power plants in 2010, as well as any development of emission standards for greenhouse gases.

Generation Asset Exchange
 
In March 1999, FirstEnergy completed a generation asset exchange with Duquense Light, increasing our nuclear generation and further reducing our coal-based generation. Under the agreement, Duquesne Light transferred 1,436 MW at eight generating plants (six coal-based and two nuclear units) to FirstEnergy in exchange for 1,328 MW at three coal-based plants owned by FirstEnergy operating companies. (Ownership actually transferred on December 3, 1999.) Our generation portfolio became even more balanced, increasing our fuel diversity and flexibility for reducing emissions systemwide.
 
However, because those plants continue to operate under the ownership of others, we do include the emission reductions from the three power plants transferred in 1999 when we tally and report total emission reductions for the FirstEnergy system. If those improvements were included in FirstEnergys emission reduction totals, our progress in reducing emissions would be even more significant.

Clean-Coal Technologies
 
One of the most visible signs of FirstEnergys commitment to responsible environmental stewardship is the ongoing investment the company has made in research, development, and deployment of clean-coal technologies. For more than 20 years, FirstEnergy has been a national leader in efforts to accelerate the deployment of advanced clean-coal generating technologies and ensure their commercial availability. To date, FirstEnergy and our sponsoring partners have spent more than $430 million on the advancement of clean-coal technologies. Some of these projects have led to the development of control technologies for SO, NOx and mercury removal that are widely used today.

Coal is the most abundant energy source in North America, with an estimated 250-year supply based on current usage levels. Coal plays a significant role in providing reliable, affordable electricity to our homes, businesses and communities. More than 50 percent of the electricity generated in the U.S., and 40 percent worldwide, comes from coal. While energy conservation, energy efficiency and alternative methods of generating electricity may reduce our reliance on coal, it will continue to play a significant role even as we move forward into what is likely to be a carbon-constrained environment. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that coal will continue to be the source of about half of all U.S. electric power through 2025.

Keeping coal in the mix of clean, efficient, economical power generation options is critical to meeting overall electricity needs of the future, which the EIA forecasts will increase steadily by about 1.9 percent annually through 2025.  Therefore, accelerating the deployment of advanced clean-coal generating technologies toward commercial availability will be important to achieving environmental goals while energy consumption and reliance on coal-based generation continue to grow. Given the diversity of regional electricity
4
markets and the variations in coal properties, a diverse portfolio of advanced clean-coal technologies is required.
 
Advanced clean-coal technologies cannot reach commercial availability, however, until they have been proven in full-scale operation, under varying operating conditions, and for a sufficient time period to ensure expectations are met for performance and reliability. FirstEnergy and our utility operating companies have been national leaders in the development of such technologies with some 15 clean-coal technology projects dating back to 1986, including various partnerships with the U.S. EPA, DOE, OCDO, EPRI, and Gas Research Institute.

Case Study: Bay Shore Boiler Project
 
FirstEnergy has formed an alliance with British Petroleum Company (BP) to convert a waste byproduct into energy at its Bay Shore Plant in Oregon, Ohio. This innovative partnership combines low-emitting power generation technology with recycling to benefit the environment and the local community.
 
In 2001, the company replaced a 1950s-era coal-based boiler at its Bay Shore Plant with a state-of-the-art circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler. The CFB boiler, which is designed to operate more efficiently and effectively than traditional coal-based boilers, is fueled by petroleum coke, a waste byproduct of BPs nearby Toledo Refinery. This allowed BP to upgrade the refinery to use a less expensive grade of crude oil.
 
Toledo Edisons partnership with BP has both environmental and community benefits:
 
Toledo Edison  and its customers  benefit from reduced fuel costs.
 
 
 
 
At FirstEnergy, we always are looking for new ways to minimize the environmental impact of our operations. As the Bay Shore project demonstrates, innovation and collaboration can be effective tools for achieving air-quality improvements  and sometimes much more.
 
The Next Generation of
Clean-Coal Technologies
 
FirstEnergy is participating in several government and industry partnerships, collaborations, and initiatives designed to identify and develop the next generation of clean-coal technologies.
 
Electro-Catalytic Oxidation
(ECO) Technology
Since 1997, FirstEnergy has partnered with New Hampshire-based Powerspan to test their Electro-Catalytic Oxidation, or ECO process, a multi-pollutant control technology for power plants. To date, the ECO technology has shown great promise for reducing emissions of NOx, SO, fine particulates, and mercury, and, as a result, FirstEnergy plans to install the first ECO system on Unit 4 of its Bay Shore Plant in Oregon, Ohio. Design engineering of the system is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2006.
2
 
In response to growing concerns over CO emissions, Powerspan also began investigating the capability to remove CO with the ECO process. In May 2004, Powerspan and the DOEs National Energy Technology Laboratory entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to develop a cost-effective CO removal process for coal-based power plants. The CO removal process is expected to be readily integrated with the ECO technology. The scope of the three-year agreement includes laboratory testing, pilot testing, and detailed studies of the CO capture process economics. FirstEnergy is taking the lead in demonstrating this technology by planning for a pilot test of the CO capture process at our Burger Plant beginning in late 2006.

EPRI CoalFleet for Tomorrow
EPRI and 42 organizations  including FirstEnergy  have joined forces to accelerate the deployment of clean, efficient, advanced coal technology and to develop options for managing CO emissions from power plants. Initially, the program will focus on development of IGCC technology to be commercially available in the next ten years. CoalFleet for Tomorrow also will address other advanced coal technologies such as ultra-supercritical pulverized coal and super-critical circulating fluidized bed combustion.

FutureGen  A Sequestration and Hydrogen Research Initiative
FutureGen is a $1-billion government/industry partnership to design, build, and operate a nearly emissions-free coal-based power plant. This partnership, under a cooperative agreement with the DOE, would provide 20 percent of the total project cost. The 275-MW prototype plant would serve as a large scale engineering laboratory for testing new clean power, carbon capture and coal-to-hydrogen technologies. It would be the most environmentally clean fossil-fueled power plant in the world. Working in conjunction with the OCDO, which is a program of the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority, FirstEnergy has submitted two candidate sites  the Toronto Plant and the Ashtabula C Plant  for consideration.

In a related effort, the company is involved in a research project  with 36 other partners and led by Battelle Memorial Institute  called the Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP). This effort is intended to study the feasibility of geological and terrestrial carbon sequestration in our region. MRCSP is just one of seven regional partnerships established by DOE to assess the technical and economic viability, as well as public acceptance, of carbon sequestration to determine the best approach.
 
Case Study: ECO Commercial
Demonstration Project
 
FirstEnergy, in partnership with a New Hampshire-based technology company, Powerspan, is commercially demonstrating a multi-pollutant control process that can be retrofitted on existing coal-based power plants to help them meet current and future environ-mental regulations. This partnership has resulted in plans for the first commercial installation of ECO at FirstEnergys Bay Shore Plant in Oregon, Ohio. The system will be installed on Bay Shores 215-MW Unit 4, with design engineering expected to begin in early 2006.
 
Since early 2004, FirstEnergys R.E. Burger Plant in Shadyside, Ohio, has been the site of a commercial demonstration of ECO technology, removing SO, NOx, mercury and other emissions from a 50-MW slipstream from the plants Unit 5. The ECO process produces a highly marketable ammonium sulfate co-product that can be sold in the fertilizer market. The Bay Shore installation will include a fertilizer processing plant on site.
2
 
Powerspans ECO technology was originally conceived in the fall of 1996 in response to the Acid Rain Program and the need for multi-pollutant controls of SO and NOx emissions. Standard technology addresses each pollutant individually, necessitating the installation of separate, costly devices, requiring large spaces not always available on space constrained sites that are typical of existing power plants. Powerspan sought to develop an integrated approach to achieve multi-pollutant reductions at a significantly lower cost than commercially available systems, thus enabling power plant owners to generate power in an environmentally responsible and more cost-effective manner.
2
 
In late 1997, FirstEnergy visited Powerspan to observe a lab-scale demonstration of the ECO technology. Based on this demonstration and laboratory test results, FirstEnergy committed to fully fund the construction and testing of a larger-scale ECO pilot unit at the companys R.E. Burger Plant.
 
The pilot test facility, originally operational in July 1998 and then modified in 2002, treated a slipstream of flue gas roughly equivalent to 1-2 MW of output from a 156-MW coal-based unit at the Burger Plant. The pilot testing showed significant reductions in emissions of SO, NOx, mercury, other heavy metals, fine particulate matter, and air toxics. Based on these successful results, FirstEnergy committed to jointly fund the first ECO commercial demonstration unit with Powerspan, a 50-MW equivalent unit costing more than $20 million.
2
 
Additional project support was secured through OCDO and the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority. The OCDO co-funds the research, development, and deployment of technologies that allow for cleaner and more economical use of Ohio coal. With the assistance of Powerspan, FirstEnergy requested, and was granted, $4.5 million from OCDO for the commercial demonstration unit at the Burger Plant. Construction of the commercial demonstration unit was completed, and unit commissioning and testing were initiated in January 2004. An additional $1-million grant to support the demonstration was awarded by OCDO and the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority in June 2005.
 
Based on ECO testing completed to date, ECO has the potential to meet regulatory requirements for SO, NOx, mercury, acid gases, hazardous air pollutants and fine particulate matter. In May 2004, Powerspan signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the DOEs National Energy Technology Laboratory to develop a cost-effective CO removal process for coal-based power plants. This process would be integrated with the existing ECO technology. Powerspan already has demonstrated in its laboratory the ability to use ECO technology to remove 90 percent of CO with the addition of supplementary equipment. FirstEnergy and Powerspan are planning a pilot test to demonstrate this CO capture process beginning in 2006.

As of April 2005, FirstEnergy had contributed more than $32 million to Powerspans technology development efforts. This includes equity investment in Powerspan and ECO demonstration project funding. FirstEnergy also serves on Powerspans Board of Directors. Frank Alix, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Powerspan, said this about FirstEnergys contribution to the commercialization of ECO technology:
 
FirstEnergys support has been the most critical factor in our ability to secure the resources we need to successfully commercialize our technology. Equally important to the financial support has been the commitment of the FirstEnergy peoplefrom the CEO, to the Board representative, to the engineering and power plant staffs. Throughout the organization, weve had the privilege of working with dedicated people who take their role as environmental stewards very seriously. Were grateful for this opportunity to help FirstEnergy meet their environmental goals in a way that benefits their community and their shareholders.

Detailed Emission Reductions Data
 
FirstEnergys many environmental actions and innovations, coupled with the companys substantial environmental investments, are making a substantial difference in our environmental performance
.
 
The following graphs illustrate the steady and significant progress made since 1990, while customer usage has increased more than ten percent.
 
Environmental Actions:
Looking Ahead
 
In March 2005, FirstEnergy announced its intentions to spend an additional $1.5 billion on environmental improvements by 2012 at generating facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania, most notably at the 2,233-MW coal-based W.H. Sammis Plant in Stratton, Ohio. The company will install new emission control equipment on all seven units at the Sammis Plant, and achieve additional reductions at other units. These include an upgrade of existing scrubber systems on Units 1-3 at the Bruce Mansfield Plant in Shippingport, Pennsylvania, increasing the SO removal from 92 percent to 95 percent.
2
 
Projects at the Sammis Plant will include reducing 95 percent of the SO emissions and 90 percent of the NOx emissions from the plants two largest units. In addition, emissions of SO and NOx at the plant's five smaller units will be reduced at least 50 percent and 70 percent, respectively. The companys commitment to reducing emissions at several other power plants could be accomplished through the installation of scrubbers and SNCR, as well as through repowering or other strategies.
2
2
 
In total, additional environmental controls could be installed on nearly 5,000 MW of the companys 7,339 MW of coal-based generating capacity. (The remainder of FirstEnergys generation comes from nearly 3,800 MW of non-emitting nuclear power, 1,599 MW of natural gas and oil, and 654 MW of pumped storage and run-of-river hydro.) Construction will begin in 2005 and be completed no later than 2012.
 
FirstEnergys $1.5-billion investment is expected to build on the significant progress already made in protecting the environment and represents an important step in complying with the new CAIR and CAMR rules, while meeting our obligations in a settlement agreement with the U.S. EPA and other parties related to the New Source Review case involving the Sammis Plant. CAIR and CAMR rules are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 of this report.

Introduction
 
Current U.S. regulations governing power plant emissions have served the environment well. Since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, emissions of the targeted criteria air pollutants have declined by 48 percent while the U.S. gross domestic product increased 164 percent. During the 32-year period between 1970 and 2002, the coal-based electricity sector reduced emissions of targeted criteria air pollutants by 31 percent, even though the use of coal to generate electricity almost tripled during that time.  As noted earlier, FirstEnergy companies have reduced emissions of NOx by more than 60 percent and SO by nearly 50 percent since the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990. Emissions of particulate matter also have declined, due to replacements and upgrades of collection equipment. By any measure, the Clean Air Act has led to significant air-quality improvements.

FirstEnergy acknowledges the need for even greater reductions, and we believe that technology, and a diverse generation portfolio, are the keys to achieving such results. In particular, we share with many other electric utilities the belief that a  that is, one that simultaneously addresses emissions of SO, NOx and mercury  can be even more effective at reducing power plant emissions than continued regulation under current law. Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, for example, there are multiple emission reduction programs with broadly similar goals, but often conflicting strategies. This complexity has led to litigation, which can result in delays in achieving future emission reductions.

What follows is a review and discussion of major regulatory and legislative proposals that present environmental compliance challenges and risks for the utility industry. Its important first, however, to understand the evolution from command-and-control emission reduction programs to cap-and-trade emission reduction programs. Continued refinement of, and reliance on, the latter approach will be critical to effectively managing FirstEnergys environmental planning, performance and compliance costs.
 
From Command-and-Control to Cap-and-Trade
 
The first comprehensive regulation of air emissions occurred in 1970 when Congress passed the Clean Air Act and established the U.S. EPA. The Clean Air Act has been amended at various times in the last 35 years, most recently in 1990.
 
Early regulatory requirements were based on a command-and-control approach, which prescribed the maximum amount of a specified pollutant that a company was allowed to discharge, in a given time period, from a particular power plant or generating unit. Command-and-control generally did not allow utilities sufficient flexibility in power plant operations or take into account individual characteristics such as the age or type of coal-based generating stations.
 
With Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Congress relied on a new approach, a market-based trading system often referred to as cap-and-trade. Under cap-and-trade, the U.S. EPA imposed a cap on the level of emissions permitted; however, rather than specify the amount of allowable emissions for each individual power plant, tradable emission allowances are allocated to the companies that own and operate the plants. Companies may use their allowances, trade them to other utilities, or bank them for future use. On an annual basis, a utilitys emissions may not exceed the total number of allowances the company holds.
 
Cap-and-trade programs offer several advantages over command-and-control programs:
 
The Clean Air Act targeted six "criteria air pollutants,' which it defined as having the potential to harm human health. They included sulfur dioxide (SO), nitrogen dioxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb), particulate matter (PM), and ozone (O). Nitrogen dioxide is one of several nitrogen oxides (NOx). Ozone, the major component of smog, is formed by a reaction of NOx and volatile organic compounds. Mercury (Hg) was not listed as a criteria air pollutant under the Clean Air Act.

As the last 15 years have demonstrated, the cap-and-trade approach has been highly successful, resulting in improved air quality at a lower cost to electricity customers than command-and-control regulation. By setting an overall cap on emissions and allowing power companies to buy and sell credits earned by facilities that exceed compliance targets, the Acid Rain Program has achieved emission reductions ahead of schedule, at a lower cost than predicted, and with nearly universal compliance.
 
As new multi-emission proposals are formulated and implemented, it is clear that proposals featuring cap-and-trade mechanisms will achieve better results. While FirstEnergy believes there is growing support among stakeholders for comprehensive yet flexible multi-emission reduction programs, we also recognize that where environmental policy is concerned, there are few absolute certainties.
 
Summary and Assessment of Recent Rules
 
While the U.S. Congress was unable to pass any of several multi-emission bills introduced between 2003 and 2005, including the Administrations Clear Skies Act, the U.S. EPA finalized rules to further control emissions of SO, NOx and mercury through cap-and-trade programs, and achieve compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and fine particulates. Taken as a whole, these new U.S. EPA rules could function in a limited and loosely coordinated fashion as a multi-emission regulatory framework for reducing emissions  that is, unless they are delayed or unraveled by litigation and/or superseded by the emergence of comprehensive multi-emission legislation. The three regulatory actions include:

Clean Air Interstate Rule

and NOx Emissions
On March 10, 2005, the U.S. EPA finalized CAIR, establishing the deepest reductions in SO and NOx emissions in more than a decade. Designed to address interstate transport of ozone and fine particulates (PM), CAIR is based on U.S. EPA modeling that shows that emissions from 28 states and the District of Columbia contribute significantly to the non-attainment of NAAQS for fine particulates and/or 8-hour ozone in the region. Among the 28 states subject to CAIR are all four states where FirstEnergy has power plants: Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Utilizing a cap-and-trade program based on the highly successful Acid Rain Program, CAIR will require substantial additional reductions of NOx and SO emissions in two phases:

Annual and seasonal NOx caps will begin in 2009, and annual caps for SO in 2010

FirstEnergys fossil fuel-fired generation facilities in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania will be subject to the caps on both NOx and SO, while the companys sole fossil fuel-fired generation facility in New Jersey will be subject only to the NOx caps.

U.S. EPA Assessment of CAIRs
Targeted Reductions
According to U.S. EPA, emissions of NOx and SO in the affected states will be reduced to the following levels:

The future cost to FirstEnergy of compliance with these mandated reductions will be substantial. Much will depend on how the requirements ultimately are implemented by the states in which FirstEnergy companies operate affected facilities.
 
CAIR Implementation Issues
Each state affected by CAIR is required to submit a revised SIP by September 2006. If a state does not submit a revised SIP, U.S. EPA will promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). States may achieve CAIRs required reductions by limiting emissions from any type of source they choose; however, states wishing to participate in the regional cap-and-trade program must achieve of their reductions from electric generating units only.

Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR)
On March 15, 2005, US EPA finalized CAMR, a program designed to reduce mercury emissions from coal-based power plants in all 50 states.
 
Utilizing a national cap-and-trade program, CAMR will require reductions of mercury emissions in two phases from all coal-based electric generating units with a maximum output capacity of 25 megawatts or greater.
 
 
 
CAMR also requires new boilers (i.e., facilities beginning construction after January 30, 2004) to meet stringent New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) in addition to being subject to the cap-and-trade program. The NSPS mercury emission limit for new boilers depends on fuel type, technology type and add-on controls.
 
CAMR Implementation Issues
CAMRs cap-and-trade program will be implemented through individual state programs. The U.S. EPA has assigned each state (and two Native American tribes) an emissions budget for mercury. Each state has complete authority for allocating allowances among its subject sources; alternatively, a state may instead choose to use a U.S. EPA developed federal model for allowance allocation. States are required to submit revised SIPs, with initial allowance allocation decisions, to U.S. EPA by October 31, 2006.
 
The graphic on the next page illustrates the time frame for implementation of CAIR and CAMR.

State Implementation Plans
As noted earlier in this chapter, both CAIR and CAMR require new and/or updated SIPs, and there are uncertainties associated with both.
 
 
 
There are many uncertainties and critical unanswered questions related to the implementation of CAIR and CAMR. How these questions ultimately are answered will impact FirstEnergys exposure to risk with regard to its emission reduction obligations.
 
Mercury Emissions: Global Challenge Requires Global Solution
 
The U.S. EPAs new CAMR rule calls for a 70-percent reduction in mercury emissions by 2018. CAMR will require mercury emission reductions from all coal-based electric generating units in the United States with a maximum output capacity of 25 MW or greater.
 
It is critical, however, to understand that even with reductions of this magnitude, the impact on U.S. air quality will be minimal. We simply cannot escape the fact that mercury emissions are a challenge that require a solution.

8-Hour Ground-Level Ozone
and Fine Particulate Rules
In July 1997, U.S. EPA promulgated changes in the NAAQS for ozone and proposed a new NAAQS for PM. The final implementation rule for 8-hour ground-level ozone was issued on April 15, 2004, and took effect on June 15, 2004. The 8-hour ground-level ozone rule set forth the classification scheme for non-attainment areas. State and local governments have until 2007 to prepare an SIP to bring non-attainment areas into attainment by 2009 or 2010, depending on their classification.
2.5
 
U.S. EPA issued designations for counties not in attainment with the PM standard in December 2004; those designations became effective April 5, 2005. States and tribes with designated non-attainment areas must submit plans by February 2008 outlining how they will meet the PM standards beginning in February 2010.

FirstEnergys Response to
Regulatory Proposals
In response to these new rules, FirstEnergy is carefully developing a number of different compliance scenarios. We also are participating
in state-level efforts to develop implementation strategies for attaining NAAQS.
 
FirstEnergy already has committed to the installation of more than $1.5 billion in additional emission-control technologies between 2006 and 2012, which will lay the groundwork for our compliance.
 
State Initiatives
 
In addition to federal legislative and regulatory efforts under way that could lead to reductions of NOx, SO and mercury, there are state initiatives that could play a role in how we comply with future laws, rules or regulations.
2
 
Ozone Transport Commission
The Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) is a multi-state organization created under the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments to address issues related to the transport of ground-level ozone in the northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. OTC implemented a three-phase effort to reduce emissions of NOx from electricity generators between 1999 and 2004.
 
Proposed State Mercury Rules
 
- The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) has announced that it will develop statewide regulations of mercury emissions from coal-based power plants. The regulations, which could be more stringent than CAMR, may take up to a year to complete.
Pennsylvania
 
- The NJDEP enacted rules in December 2004 that will reduce mercury emissions from power plants, iron and steel smelters, and municipal solid waste incinerators. Under the rules, all coal-based boilers will be required to reduce mercury emissions to less than 3 milli-grams/MWh or achieve a mercury emission reduction efficiency of at least 90 percent.

Allowance Allocation Methodology
As noted earlier in this chapter, there is widespread acknowledgement that cap-and-trade programs offer a viable, cost-effective mechanism for achieving emission-reduction goals. Opinions vary, however, on the best methodology for cap-and-trade programs to use in allocating allowances to affected facilities. The question is a critical one.
 
The allocation methodology used in the Acid Rain Program is an example of an. In this program, SO allowances were allocated based by the affected sources in a baseline year.

Allowances for most electric generating units were determined using the following formulas:
 
2.5 pounds of SOper mmBtu of heat input, multiplied by the unit's baseline mmBtu (i.e., the average fossil fuel consumed from 1985 through 1987)
Phase I (1995-2000):
2
 
1.2 pounds of SO per mmBtu of heat input, multiplied by the unit's baseline heat input
Phase II (2000 through the present): 
2
 
Most of the Acid Rain Programs allowances were allocated to those facilities requiring the greatest emission reductions. The rationale was that this would help mitigate the economic impact of compliance at these facilities. New generating facilities not in operation during the baseline years received no allocation; to meet their annual compliance obligations, owners of these facilities have to purchase allowances from companies with excess allowances.
 
While the Acid Rain Program generally has been deemed a success, FirstEnergy believes the programs input-based allocation methodology is unfair in its treatment of different categories of SO emission sources. For example, the methodology disadvantages companies that previously had invested in non-emitting generation. Conversely, companies that did make such investments received a full allocation of allowances.
2
not
 
FirstEnergy prefers an in which allowances are allocated In other words, allowances are allocated to reflect the economic value of a generating units output, measured by the units share of total generation within its sector. Because this approach is based on output, new and non-emitting generating facilities, including renewables and nuclear, would be entitled to their proportionate share of the allowances.
output-based, generation-neutral methodology
based on the megawatts of power produced.
 
Not only does the output-based, generation-neutral methodology create a more level playing field for both existing and new generating units  regardless of fuel type or fuel consumption  it also rewards companies for achieving greater environmental efficiency in their generation operations. Just as important from an environmental stewardship perspective, an output-based approach to allowance allocation provides better incentives for utilities to use lower-carbon fuels and non-emitting technologies than an input-based approach.
 
An output-based, generation neutral approach also will be much more successful at spurring the necessary transformation of our nations aggregate electric power resources to a cleaner, more modern generating fleet. The performance-rewarding incentives provided by an output-based approach will be powerful drivers of higher-efficiency generation, accelerated technological innovations and superior environmental progress.
 
The question of allocation allowance methodology is important to FirstEnergy in the context of CAIR and CAMR. Model rules for both regulations contemplate a traditional input-based methodology (for CAIR, a nominal emission rate will be applied to baseline heat input to calculate allowances; for CAMR, baseline heat input will be multiplied by scaling factors for different coal types). FirstEnergy will be moderately disadvantaged as a result of these model rules because the companys substantial reliance on non-emitting (largely nuclear) generation is not recognized under input-based allocation.
 
Emissions Projections
 
FirstEnergy is expecting to spend nearly $1.5 billion on control equipment in the 2006 to 2012 time period to reduce NOx, SOand mercury emissions. This additional control equipment is projected to reduce NOx and SO emissions by more than 212,000 tons per year. As a co-benefit of these achievements, we also expect significant reductions in mercury emissions.
2
2
 
Even with these expenditures and resulting emission reductions, we expect that we will purchase some emission allowances from the marketplace to comply with CAIR and CAMR. As part of our risk-management process, FirstEnergy continually assesses the risks associated with reliance on emission allowance markets for compliance with reduction requirements. As part of this assessment, we consider additional capital expenditures on pollution control equipment in return for reduced exposure to energy allowancemarket fluctuations. We are mindful of the lead-time required for such equipment installations, and we factor this into our risk assessment.
 
 
The charts on the next page illustrate FirstEnergys emissions beginning in 1990 and projected through 2020. The range of future projections is based on various combinations of emission allowance trading and control equipment installations.

Initiatives
 
Overview
 
Greenhouse gas-induced climate change (also commonly referred to as global warming) is one of the most complex issues facing policy-makers and regulators charged with balancing environmental, public health, economic and energy objectives. The fact that climate change is a global issue  and, therefore requires a global solution  only makes the task of crafting effective policy all the more challenging.
 
While climate change will impact many sectors of the economy, it could have a disproportionate impact on the energy sector and on the electric utility industry in particular. State, federal and international policies and actions in response to concerns about climate change are still evolving, and there are significant issues of risk, cost and competitiveness to consider.
 
As climate change policies take shape, FirstEnergy will continue to undertake voluntary actions to reduce GHG emissions. We view these steps both as part of our environmental stewardship and as part of responsible strategic planning. However, to achieve significant reductions while continuing to meet the nations energy needs, it will be necessary to develop and deploy cost-effective technologies to capture and sequester GHGs from existing coal-based power plants.
 
This chapter will outline some of those efforts, including the completion of a systemwide GHG inventory, participation in the DOEs MRCSP and continuation of our work with Powerspan to test their ECO carbon capture technology, as well as work to increase our non-emitting generation capacity by uprating our nuclear plants, and efforts to increase renewable generation through power purchase agreements with wind farm developers.

Greenhouse Gases and
the Greenhouse Effect
 
Understanding climate change requires an understanding of what is called the greenhouse effect.  As energy from the sun warms the surface of the Earth, heat is radiated from the surface. Some of this heat simply passes back through the atmosphere and out into space, but a portion of it is absorbed by certain gases that exist naturally in our atmosphere. The heat that is trapped by these gases  called greenhouse gases because the effect is similar to what happens when heat is captured by the glass panels of a greenhouse  is what keeps Earths temperatures within a range that allows life as we know it to thrive. Without the natural insulating effect of GHGs, large areas of the planet would be uninhabitable.
 
Climate change concerns are based on the belief that increased concentrations of GHGs from human activities are causing a warming of the Earths atmosphere at the surface (i.e., global warming) and potentially creating undesirable environmental impacts.

Greenhouse gases, in the aggregate, make up less than one percent of the Earths atmosphere. While most of the major GHGs occur naturally, human activities add to the levels of many of GHGs in the atmosphere. The most common GHGs are:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, several powerful GHGs are generated in a variety of industrial processes. These include , and
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
hydrofluoro-carbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
sulfur hexafluoride (SF

Greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere can remain there for periods ranging from decades to centuries, depending on the gas.
 
Each greenhouse gas differs in terms of its concentration in the atmosphere and its ability to absorb heat  i.e., its potential warming effect. For example:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To provide a more useful metric for comparison and analysis, estimates of GHG often are expressed as units of millions of metric tons of carbon equivalents (MMTCE), which weights each gas by its Global Warming Potential (GWP). GWP is calculated as the ratio of one unit mass of a greenhouse gas to one unit mass of CO over a specified time period. GWP reflects both the length of time a gas stays in the atmosphere and how efficiently it traps heat.

FirstEnergys Greenhouse Gas Emissions
 
FirstEnergys greenhouse gas emissions primarily consist of CO, SF, NO, CH and HFCs, with three of those  CO, NO and CH being created during combustion of fossil fuels. Our fossil-fueled plants are designed and operated to optimize the combustion process and achieve the best levels of efficiency. This results in lower costs and improved environmental performance. While this optimization process produces fewer carbon particles, carbon monoxides and hydro-carbons, it also produces more CO.

In addition, SF is used as an insulator in FirstEnergys transmission and distribution system, and HFCs are used in cooling equipment such as building air conditioners. Small amounts of SF and HFCs are periodically released as a result of leaks or routine maintenance activities.

When all greenhouse gases are converted to a CO equivalent, CO from the burning of fossil fuels accounts for approximately 98 percent of FirstEnergys total GHG emissions. FirstEnergy emits 2 percent of total CO emitted by utilities in the United States and one tenth of one percent of all GHGs emitted globally.

The Concern Over Climate Change
 
Studies indicate that the climate system is changing, and there is growing concern among climate scientists that human activities are responsible for much of that change. While opinions vary on the likely magnitude and immediacy of the concern, little disagreement exists today over several key facts:

Impact on Emission Control Regulations
The concern over climate change is real. While there appears to be some agreement in the scientific community that the climate system is changing, there is uncertainty about the appropriate actions and timeframes for effective solutions.
 
Climate change also is certain to be a significant factor in shaping the regulatory landscape in which FirstEnergy will operate for the next 50 years or more. The specific contours of that landscape will be determined, however, by factors that today are difficult to define with certainty. What will be the pace and nature of future climate change? What is the potential impact on socio-economic conditions and the global economy? What is a reasonable time frame for the development and adoption of effective and affordable new technologies? Should a market for carbon be established now to help the developing world move toward advanced technologies? The answers to these questions require thoughtful research and studies. In the meantime, we simply have to use our best judgment  guided by the evolving state of climate change science  to determine the most appropriate response to the issue of climate change.
 
Sufficient concern exists to give rise to a growing interest in developing policies to regulate emissions of CO and other GHGs. FirstEnergy believes that regulations governing COemission levels and reduction standards eventually will be put into effect. Even though the parameters and time line for such standards are unknown, and may remain unknown for some time, we believe that considering the possibility of future GHG constraints when making strategic investment decisions is responsible and necessary.
2
2
 
To that end, FirstEnergy expects to spend approximately $50 million over the next five years on products, programs and activities that will help reduce GHG emissions or intensity in the near-to-mid term and contribute to the development of technologies and solutions in the long term to help our nation address the issue of climate change. These investments are expected to focus on the following areas:

International, Federal and
State Initiatives
 
Advances in our understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change are giving impetus to international, federal, regional, and state efforts to regulate GHG emissions. Individually and collectively, these emerging and evolving policies and actions eventually may create a domestic market for CO and other GHGs similar to that used by the European Union.
2
 
International Action
In December 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, the first international agreement specifying GHG emission reduction targets and timetables was established. The agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, was signed by the then current Administration in the fall of 1998 but was never ratified by Congress. This agreement would obligate the United States to reduce its CO emissions by 7 percent below 1990 levels by about the year 2010. Due to growth in the U.S. economy since 1990, the actual projected reduction for the United States would be more than 30 percent.
2
 
The current Administration has announced that, while it intends to pursue measures to reduce GHG intensity, it does not support implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, because the treaty applies only to developed countries  exempting nations with rapidly growing energy demands, such as China, India and Brazil  and implementation of the Protocol would have strong detri-mental effects to the U.S. and world economies.
 
The treaty finally took effect on February 16, 2005, after being ratified by at least 55 countries accounting for 55 percent of the 1990 CO emissions. Several participating countries  most notably those in the European Union  are initiating policies such as emissions trading in an attempt to meet their targets. Many other countries are evaluating options for reducing GHG intensity consistent with the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change, but as part of an agreement or approach other than the Kyoto Protocol.
2
 
Federal Action: Administration
In February 2002, the Administration proposed the U.S. Global Climate Policy, which challenges U.S. business and industry to slow and eventually reverse growth in GHG emissions without sacrificing economic growth. The Administrations plan, which is voluntary, relies on the use of a measure known as greenhouse gas intensity  the ratio of emissions to economic output, measured as the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of GDP. In conjunction with the new policy, a national goal was established of reducing U.S. GHG intensity by 18 percent by 2012.
 
The Administration also called for an enhanced registry and improved guidelines for reporting emissions and emission reductions. Companies that participate will be permitted to bank their emission reductions in a GHG registry. Under Chapter 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act, the DOE expects to issue final guidelines by the end of 2005, with an effective date following completion of public review by June 1, 2006.
 
The Administration has supported the Global Climate Policy with unprecedented funding for climate-change-related programs. The fiscal year 2005 budget called for energy tax incentives that promote GHG emission reductions totaling $680 million this year and $4.1 billion through fiscal year 2009. The tax incentives include credits for the purchase of hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles, residential solar heating systems, energy produced from landfill gas, electricity produced from alternative energy sources such as wind and biomass, and combined heat and power systems.

In February 2003, the DOE launched Climate VISION, a voluntary public-private partnership designed to help U.S. business and industry respond to the Presidents challenge to reduce GHG intensity by 18 percent during the next decade. The utility sector, including FirstEnergy, is participating in Climate VISION through a voluntary program coordinated by EEI called Power Partners.

Federal Action: The Energy Policy
Act of 2005
Congress took a step toward addressing climate change with passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was signed into law in August. Title XVI of the Act creates incentives for development of technologies to reduce GHG intensity and encourages partnerships with developing nations.
 
Specifically, the Energy Policy Act provides incentives for development of low or non-GHG-emitting generation, advanced nuclear generation and systems, advanced coal generation, and renewable energy technologies, as well as technologies for carbon capture and sequestration, fuel cell research, improved energy efficiency and energy conservation. We believe this is an important step in the development, demonstration, commercialization and deployment of emerging and new technologies that will help move the nation toward significant, long-term reductions in GHG intensity.
 
Title XVI of the Energy Policy Act was based on three climate bills introduced by Senator Hagel (R-Nebraska) that dealt with the international, domestic and tax components of the climate issue. Considered together, Sen. Hagels approach represented a three-pronged strategy to assist developing countries in reducing GHG emissions and also extend existing research and development tax incentives. By encouraging a technological solution to global climate change, we believe this to be a reasoned approach to the issue. The proposals were:
 
 
 
 
International Developments
The Administration recently pledged support for two international initiatives designed to address climate change on a global level. The first, a Plan of Action agreed to by leaders at the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, focuses on improving energy efficiency; promoting developments in nuclear power, clean-coal technologies, renewable energy and power transmission enhancements; and supporting research and development. The Plan includes both developed and developing nations. The second, the new Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, is a results-oriented initiative that will look at ways to ensure adequate energy supplies while addressing emission reductions, energy security and climate change concerns. In addition to the United States, the partnership includes Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea.
 
State Initiatives
A number of state governments have taken steps to begin regulating GHG emissions. State actions that directly impact FirstEnergy companies include:

The fact is, there are no cost-effective, commercially viable and available control technologies for reducing CO emissions from electric generating plants. FirstEnergy believes more time is needed to develop technologies that will cost-effectively capture and sequester CO and other GHGs. In the meantime, we continue to be an active partner in a number of successful voluntary efforts to reduce emissions of CO and other GHGs.

Voluntary GHG-Reduction Programs and Partnerships
FirstEnergy already has made significant voluntary reductions in CO and other GHGs. As reported in our 1605(b) filing with the DOE, annual reductions of CO emissions have averaged 8.9 million tons through improvements in plant efficiency, reduced business travel, uprates at nuclear plants, reductions in SF emissions and tree planting. In the 14 years that we have made this voluntary reporting, we have reduced the equivalent of more than 125 million tons of CO. We support and are working aggressively to help the nation achieve the 18-percent reduction in CO emissions intensity over the next ten years called for in the Administrations Global Climate Policy. One way we are doing that is through our involvement in a number of voluntary programs and partnerships working to advance control technology research, development and deployment for the purpose of reducing, avoiding, and sequestering GHGs. They include:

FirstEnergys CO
2
Emission Projections
 
FirstEnergy has prepared two different estimates (minimum and maximum) of the companys CO emissions through 2020, assuming a range of potential responses to the U.S. EPAs CAIR and CAMR rules. The precise impact of these regulations on our coal-based generation assets will depend on the economics of capital investment in emission controls (which would lower dispatch costs and increase economic generation) versus emission allowance purchases and/or unit retirements.
2
 
As mentioned in Chapter 3 of this report, FirstEnergy exchanged generation assets with Duquesne Light in 1999. This asset exchange increased our nuclear generation and decreased our coal-based generation. One result of this exchange was to increase our fuel diversity and therefore reduce both absolute CO emissions and emissions intensity of our generation fleet. This reduced the potential impact of CO constraints on our generation fleet and provides us significant differentiation and competitive advantage compared with other regional generators. As a result, we present our CO emission projections in two ways, first without consideration of the asset exchange and then with consideration of the asset exchange.

Assessment
Modeling the impact of any proposed federal or state CO emissions program is difficult due to the many uncertainties about how such a program would be implemented (including reduction requirements, sectors included/ excluded, timing, etc.). However, several organizations have modeled the impact of the Climate Stewardship Act of 2003 (the McCain-Lieberman proposal). The DOEs EIA, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Charles River Associates (CRA) all have modeled the potential impact of McCain-Lieberman (expressed as price per ton of CO) with some variations in input and output assumptions and conclusions, namely regarding natural gas supply and demand and pricing.
2
2
 
Even though assumptions vary for the three forecasts, we can utilize this range of potential CO allowance prices to illustrate the potential impact on FirstEnergys generating costs relative to other large generators in our region. To do this, we combined the lowest estimated CO allowance prices (MIT) and the highest estimated CO allowance prices (EIA) with FirstEnergys low-case and high-case generation estimates. It should be noted that this is a simplified assumption because we did not model a federal or state CO program to arrive at our generation estimates. A forecast of FirstEnergys generation under a CO cap could, in fact, produce vastly different generation levels depending on CO allowance prices, natural gas prices and the corresponding impacts on wholesale electric market prices. Also, we note that this example is exclusive of any allocated CO allowances, which would serve to mitigate some of the estimated additional cost.
2

Even though these numbers (especially in 2020) may seem high at first glance, in our market area (ECAR & PJM), FirstEnergy would be at the low end of potential CO costs. This is due primarily to our non-emitting nuclear plants, which accounted for 40 percent of FirstEnergys total electricity production in 2004. As indicated in the following table, FirstEnergy is the third-largest electricity producer in the region. At the same time, assum-ing the 2004 generation mix is constant into the future, we would have one of the lowest carbon intensities and, therefore, costs based on our CO emissions per MWh of generation. If regional electricity prices fully reflect the projected increase in CO-related costs, FirstEnergy potentially could see an in operating margin (revenues less dispatch costs).
2

increase
 
In a CO-constrained economy, FirstEnergys coal-based generation fleet will face additional costs. However, much uncertainty remains as to whether these additional costs will drive margins to a point where it becomes uneconomic to continue operation of the coal-based units.
2
 
Natural gas, while producing 30 percent less CO than coal, faces supply, cost and infrastructure constraints that would make it an unlikely choice for addressing climate change. Depending on the region, season and time of day, natural gas combined-cycle plants are the marginal units  i.e., the last unit dispatched in order to meet load, which in turn sets the market price in a particular region. The number of hours that natural gas units will function as marginal units is expected to grow into the future. In such an environment, coal-based units will have to meet or beat the dispatch cost of these combined-cycle gas units in order to continue operating. The biggest single component of a combined-cycle gas units dispatch cost is the delivered price of natural gas. Given its low emissions of SOand NOx, the next biggest potential dispatch cost component in the future could be CO, depending upon the level of CO emission allowance prices (assuming a cap-and-trade system is implemented).

36
To analyze potential impacts to a baseload coal-based unit in such an environment, we constructed a scenario in which a new natural gas combined-cycle unit is the marginal unit (i.e., the price setter). We calculated the required natural gas price that would equal the dispatch cost of a typical baseload coal-based unit, given varying natural gas and CO allowance price combinations.
2
 
 
 
 
For example, if natural gas prices were $7/mmBtu, it would take a CO allowance price of $50/ton or greater in order for a natural gas unit to beat the dispatch cost of a baseload coal-based unit. Even without considering the impact of a state or federal CO program, some natural gas forecasters are predicting prices in that range. Any upward pressure on natural gas demand due to CO compliance decisions would tend to drive natural gas prices even higher. Given this dynamic, we believe FirstEnergys baseload coal-based capacity should be well positioned to continue operating profitably into the future.
2
2
2
 
The remaining coal-based units in FirstEnergys fleet are considered intermediate units  i.e., they operate to regulate the hour-to-hour changes in regional load rather than running at high levels every hour as base-load units do. These intermediate units typically have lower heat rates and less-efficient emission controls than a typical coal-based baseload unit, resulting in higher dispatch costs. A COprogram may make some of these units uneconomical to run, depending on natural gas and CO emission allowance prices.
2
2
 
 
Unlike baseload units, an coal-based unit breaks even with combined-cycle natural gas generation (burning $7/mmBtu fuel) at a CO price of $17/ton or greater  which is well within the potential CO price forecast range of $14 to $34/ton in 2020. If it were economical to install more efficient emission controls (for SO, NOx  or mercury) on these units, the break-even CO price would be higher. Another potential scenario could have less efficient (i.e., higher dispatch cost) intermediate coal-based units as the marginal units. If FirstEnergys intermediate coal-based units are more efficient (i.e., lower dispatch cost) than the marginal unit, they could possibly continue to operate.

Looking Ahead
We can observe a clear trend across the world, and (on a smaller scale) in states across the nation, toward CO and GHG regulations. We can reasonably expect federal GHG emission standards and controls at some point. However, what we know far exceeds, in quantity and magnitude, what we know.

do
 
The unanswered questions are numerous: Will future regulations focus only on CO, or will other GHGs be targeted? What sources of GHGs will be the focus of future regulations? Will emissions trading be part of the regulatory frame-work? If so, how will the program be structured? How will allowances be allocated? Will utilities be permitted to bank allowances for future use? At what level will caps be set? And what year will be used as the baseline year? What kind of timeline will be established for meeting new standards? Will the regulatory environment allow for recovery of costs associated with compliance?

All of this uncertainty makes it difficult to determine the potential impact and risks associated with GHG emissions; to make effective, strategic capital investment decisions; and to project our costs, revenues, and profits. A clear national policy on global climate change is needed for FirstEnergy to plan for the future. Nonetheless, we believe FirstEnergy is well-positioned competitively due to our diverse and modern generating fleet, our strategic fuel mix, our installed technologies and planned upgrades, and our strong position as a market leader.
 
Chapter
6
: Risk Mitigation Strategy
 
Overview
 
Even with a diverse, balanced generation portfolio, FirstEnergy will continue to rely on coal-based generation. This continued reliance will come with some measure of risk in a regulatory environment as a result of increasingly stringent emission control standards for criteria air pollutants and hazardous air pollutants, and the potential for standards for CO and other greenhouse gases.
2
 
Managing the risk associated with global climate change policy is by definition an encounter with uncertainty. Even though future constraints on CO and other GHG emission standards seem likely, significant questions remain about how stringent regulations will be, how aggressive implementation time lines will be, how much flexibility emission sources will be given to comply with the standards, and more. On top of these unknowns are similar concerns about other air-quality issues and the attendant regulatory, economic and technological ramifications of those issues.
2
 
FirstEnergy continues to employ a deliberate, thoughtful and strategic approach to assessing air-quality issues and a full spectrum of options for managing and mitigating risk related to those issues. We believe it is prudent to prepare for a range of possible regulatory approaches to GHG emissions standards  and we are doing so.
 
Future actions planned to address anticipated and evolving air-quality issues are an obvious focal point for any evaluation of FirstEnergys competitive position, market opportunities and investment risk. At the same time, a comprehensive understanding of FirstEnergys risk mitigation strategy requires taking into account the companys past and present actions as well. Believing that federal and/or state GHG emission standards are likely, we have planned  and taken appropriate strategic action  accordingly.
 
Past Actions
 
As noted in earlier chapters of this report, FirstEnergy has taken numerous actions that have helped position the company to compete successfully in a regulatory environment characterized by increasingly stringent emission standards and potential GHG emission controls. These actions generally fall within two categories: (1) , which have reduced the companys reliance on less-efficient, coal-based, CO-emitting generation; and (2) , which has allowed FirstEnergy to produce about 40 percent of the electricity we generate from non-emitting, non-fossil-fuel sources.

Coal Unit Shutdowns
FirstEnergy began retiring older and less-efficient coal-based power plants in 1970. During the past 35 years, we have taken 57 of these units, totaling nearly 1,900 MW, out of service.
 
Investment in Non-emitting Generation
Our ability to produce about 40 percent of our electricity from non-emitting, non-fossil-fuel sources is due to investments the companies made during the 1970s and 1980s to build a nuclear power portfolio that now includes:

FirstEnergys substantial nuclear generation capacity allows the company to avoid emitting about 25 million tons of CO166,000 tons of SO and 62,000 tons of NOx that otherwise would be emitted annually if coal- or gas-fired generation were used instead. The strategic value of our nuclear fleet will only increase with the implementation of the U.S. EPAs new CAIR and CAMR rules, as well as the potential implementation of first-ever federal emission standards for GHGs.

Long term, additional generation capacity is available from power uprates at all four nuclear units, and in some cases that work already is under way. A summary and time line for the planned uprates and enhancement of FirstEnergys nuclear output are provided later in this chapter.
 
Present Actions
FirstEnergys current and ongoing actions to minimize risk associated with air-quality issues, particularly those associated with potential CO and other GHG emissions, generally can be grouped into three categories: (a) dealing with advanced coal generation, CO capture and GHG emission reduction; (b) sources that, like the companys nuclear fleet, do not emit GHGs; and (c) programs that reduce the amount of CO and other GHGs emitted into the atmosphere.

Public Policy
As part of our effort to engage in public policy discussions surrounding issues of importance to our customers and shareholders, we have joined the Global Roundtable on Climate Change, a three-year project to analyze and evaluate climate change issues. This forum comprising 150 high-level representatives of critical stakeholder groups engages in discussion, analysis and exploration of areas of potential consensus regarding core scientific, technological and economic issues critical to shaping sound public policies on climate change. Participants are drawn from all regions of the world and every major economic sector, and include leading figures from international organizations, national and local governments, business, academia and non-governmental organizations.
 
We also engage in public policy discussions through our participation in the Nuclear Energy Institute's (NEI) environmental committee, EEI's subcommittee on global climate change, EPRI's environmental council and the Pennsylvania Energy Advisory Board of the Department of Environmental Protection. These groups focus on ways to reduce emissions of SO, NOx,  mercury and CO through upgrading and relicensing nuclear power plants, developing advanced technologies for coal, and promoting the use of renewable energy.

Research
Clean coal power will play a vital role in the ability of FirstEnergy and the power industry in general to meet more stringent regulations of criteria air pollutants and hazardous air pollutants, as well as expected CO regulations. For that reason, FirstEnergy is participating in a number of research projects focused on advanced coal generation systems, CO capture and GHG reduction options. The companys involvement and investment in these programs are an important component of our ongoing efforts to mitigate risk associated with air-quality issues and to position the company to operate successfully in the carbon-constrained regulatory environment we expect to take shape in the future.

This research project performs technical and economic assessments of specific technologies, currently focused on sequestration, and makes focused investments in exploration of new technologies (e.g., carbon capture and disposal regional test centers). The program will help FirstEnergy respond to existing regulations; understand and evaluate strengths and weak-nesses of alternative emission reduction options; evaluate and choose whether to take voluntary actions; understand operational and financial impacts of possible future regulation; identify hedging strategies that may reduce exposure to future regulation; and evaluate investments for coping with GHG reduction requirements.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For FirstEnergy, any resulting mobile emission reductions from the use of electric vehicles will enhance environmental compliance and potentially lead to emission credits that can help level the playing field between mobile and stationary emission sources. The company currently is engaged in discussions with customers and communities about several electric transportation demonstration projects, both on-road and off-road. One technology we are exploring is plug-in hybrid vehicles, in which on-road vehicles are configured with both an internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric motor, and batteries are charged through regenerative braking or a plug-in charging station. This technology has a number of potential economic and environmental benefits, including:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the technology may provide opportunities for cost reductions, fuel flexibility for fuel cell vehicles, and cleaner distributed energy using vehicle-to-grid power capability.
 
Other transportation-related initiatives include work with the University of Toledos Intermodal Transportation Institute and Ohio manufacturers to produce components for the next generation of electric hybrid vehicles, an exploration of the potential for truck-stop electrification, and a study of the feasibility of electric-powered forklift trucks.

Renewable Energy Sources
Renewable energy is generally defined as any source that is continually replenished, as distinct from fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil and gas) in which supplies are drawn down and depleted over time without any mechanism to adequately replace them. All renewable sources ultimately are powered by the sun  through direct radiation, plant growth and heating of the atmosphere, which in turn produces wind and drives water cycles  and heating of the earth. (Tidal power and some wave action are caused by planetary motion, with wind also contributing to waves.)
 
Each renewable resource category encompasses many variations of process, technology, and time and place. Before the era of fossil fuels, of humankind's energy use was based on renewable sources. The low cost and immense scale of fossil fuel use resulted in renewable resources playing a much smaller role, relatively speaking, over time. Major obstacles to the reemergence of renewable energy sources include capital and operating cost, operational scale, and entrenched interests and habits.
all
 
A renaissance has been under way for several decades, however, as environmental and resource concerns have become more significant and technology has advanced dramatically. In almost all categories, dramatic cost reductions during the past 30 years have brought renewables much closer to parity with dominant nonrenew-able supplies, particularly when so-called external costs are considered. Global climate change due to GHGs is a major externality that is of increasing concern to society. Renewable energy can help mitigate GHGs directly because renewables do not add net CO to the atmosphere.
2
 
FirstEnergy currently has, through direct ownership or power-purchase agreements, 107 MW of renewable capacity, and we expect to add 210 MW of additional wind power during the next two years. The following chart provides an overview of FirstEnergys current and planned renewable energy capacity and generation output.

They are cited here as an example of FirstEnergys proactive approach to study, develop, and deploy new non-emitting technologies.

The wind, hydro and NUG units displace less-efficient, higher-cost, fossil-fuel generating units and their associated emissions of SO, NOx, mercury, and CO. To quantify the impact, we calculated the average emissions for the marginal fossil-fuel units, beginning with data from PJMs   report.

State of the Market
 
 
We estimated the impact of these renewable energy units on emissions by considering the capacity factors and weight-averaged emissions of the generation that would be displaced in the PJM market. The estimate of emissions avoided is shown in the table.
 
 
 
Renewables will never fully replace fossil units due to the variability of their generation. However, increased use of renewable generation can have a beneficial impact by reducing total emissions and helping the company meet more stringent emission standards and regulations.
 
Partnering for the Future  Collaborations
in Renewable Technologies
 
FirstEnergy is constantly seeking and creating innovative solutions to the ongoing challenge of making the energy generation and delivery system more efficient  and thus more reliable, more affordable and more environmentally responsible. Following are brief descriptions of three small-scale examples of FirstEnergys leadership, collaboration and innovation targeted in part at improving energy efficiency and environmental performance.
 
 
 
 
 
Energy Efficiency & Renewables
FirstEnergy companies actively promote energy efficiency and work closely with customers to reduce demand and modify usage and load patterns for greater efficiencies and cost savings. Added benefits include enhanced system reliability and reduced emissions.

FirstEnergy has helped manage this program since its inception in May 2001. During the initial four-year period of the energy-efficiency component of the program, an estimated 169,000 metric tons of CO were avoided through a range of initiatives, including rebates, discounts, and delivery of energy-efficiency products and services for JCP&L customers in New Jersey.  If these savings are extrapolated to the expected lives of the installed energy-efficiency measures, the lifetime CO emissions avoided would be more than 1,339,000 metric tons.

New Jersey also offers the CleanPower Choice Program, which gives electric customers the option to pay a premium to encourage the development of clean power sources  such as wind, solar, small or low-impact hydro.
 
 
 
Future Actions
 
FirstEnergy works hard to meet our regions need for reliable and affordable energy in an environmentally responsible manner. As the demand for electricity continues to grow, so too does our commitment to protect the environment and reduce emissions. While we take pride in our accomplishments to date, and are optimistic about continued positive results from the important work already under way, we will continue to seek new ways to further protect the environment by reducing emissions, managing the use of natural resources wisely, and supporting research on environmental-control technologies.
 
We expect to meet our voluntary GHG reduction goals by continuous improvements in energy efficiency at our facilities, fuel diversification, employing effective demand-side management programs, increasing our levels of renewable energy, sequestering carbon through forest preservation and planting of trees, purchasing allowances when economically prudent and, possibly, sequestrating GHGs in underground geologic formations.
 
Voluntary Reductions
As noted throughout this report, FirstEnergy already has made significant voluntary reductions in CO and other GHGs. Through these actions, we have reduced CO emissions by an average of 8.9 million tons per year since 1990. We support and are working aggressively to help achieve the 18-percent reduction in CO emissions intensity called for in President Bushs Global Climate Policy. We will continue our involvement in a number of voluntary programs and partnerships working to advance control technology research, development, and deployment for the purpose of reducing, avoiding, and sequestering GHGs.
2
2
2
 
The experience we gain through all of our voluntary efforts will help us to better comply with future requirements. However, our ultimate strategy for complying with potential GHG regulations will depend greatly on the final details and timing of such requirements. We believe a well-constructed policy that uses a phased-in approach to gradually reduce emissions over time can be managed without undue disruption to the company, our customers, or the economy. The future impacts also depend on the pace of deployment of new emerging technologies, as well as the availability and price of natural gas.

Sequestration
FirstEnergy is committed to the development of CO sequestration projects through its participation in the MRCSP. This study is part of a DOE research initiative called FutureGen, a project to develop a virtually emission-free, coal-based electric generation and hydrogen production plant. FirstEnergy has committed $25,000 to support the Phase I study, led by Battelle Memorial Institute, to assess geological (carbon injection in deep rock formations) and terrestrial (vegetation and soil) sequestration potential for CO in the Midwest region. We also were among a number of utilities that submitted project proposals to be host sites for the DOE-sponsored Phase II project in our region. Three quarters of the funding for the $2-million to $4-million project will come from the DOE with the remainder being provided by the partnership. The DOE announced awards for the Carbon Sequestration Partnership Program, Phase II projects on June 9, 2005, and the Midwest region was one of seven regions that received a project award.

Plant Uprates
FirstEnergys risk mitigation efforts are likely to be bolstered by significant efforts to increase non-emitting generation capacity (nuclear and wind power) and to improve efficiency through turbine upgrades at the companys coal-based Bruce Mansfield Plant. Plans also are in place to secure license renewals for all four nuclear units and three hydroelectric plants.
 
  Nuclear Plant License Renewals and Uprates - License renewal applications will be filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the following schedule:

: Impact
on Customers
 
Background
While it is still unclear what, if any, actions may be taken to regulate GHG emissions (specifically CO), it is important to evaluate the impact such potential regulation might have on FirstEnergy customers. While many believe that reducing the impact of climate change will partially offset costs associated with GHG reduction efforts, the following analysis focuses solely on the impact to our customers.
2
 
No attempt has been made by FirstEnergy to quantify the CO market prices that would result from the various legislative proposals put forth (although estimates made by others are noted in Chapter 5). Instead, FirstEnergy studies have concentrated on two areas. First, factors that might limit conversion of generating units from burning coal to burning natural gas have been examined. Substituting natural gas-fired generation for coal-based generation is probably the simplest way of reducing CO emissions from power plants in the near to mid term. Second, we have used electric power price forecasting tools to evaluate the impact of a range of CO emission allowance market prices on wholesale electric power prices. These increases are used to estimate the cost impact on FirstEnergy customers.
2
2
2
 
Regarding this estimate of customer costs, it is important to realize that these costs will be affected not so much by what happens to FirstEnergy generating units, but rather by what happens to all of the generating units in the FirstEnergy market area. Our belief is that no CO requirement will be applied prior to the 2010-2015 time period. By this time, the retail sale of electricity in all of the FirstEnergy control areas is scheduled to be fully deregulated. This means that FirstEnergy will have no clearly defined set of generation customers, but rather will sell power generated by its power plants in various possible ways. Power may be sold directly to retail customers, to third parties who sell to retail customers or to the wholesale market. In any of these cases, the retail power prices will be closely related to the wholesale power market prices. It is logical to assume, therefore, that increases in wholesale electric prices due to CO regulation will be passed directly on to FirstEnergy (and other) customers.

Limits on Natural Gas Conversion
 
In 2004, FirstEnergy, with the assistance of Power & Energy Analytic Resources (PEAR), studied the impacts of potential future environmental regulations on emission allowance prices for several emissions. As part of this study, several legislative proposals concerning CO regulation were examined. Because the nature of future CO regulation, or even whether it would be regulated at all, was so uncertain, no attempt was made to forecast future CO emission allowance prices. However, the study did address the question of whether there will be sufficient natural gas supplies in the future to support a significant amount of conversion of existing electric generation plants from coal to natural gas in order to achieve proposed CO emissions.
2
2
2
2
 
At one time, natural gas was thought to be the fuel of choice in a future CO-constrained environment. The reason for this is that electric generating units burning natural gas emit up to 40 percent less COthan coal-based generating units. On the other hand, the current natural gas supply relative to demand in the U.S. is fairly tight, and natural gas prices have reflected that situation, with natural gas forward prices being at all-time high levels. With the supply of natural gas already constrained, there is concern whether there will be sufficient natural gas available in the future to replace a significant amount of generation that is currently coal-based.

In order to investigate this question, FirstEnergy worked with a natural gas forecasting consultant, Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. (EEA). EEA employs a fundamental forecasting model to estimate future natural gas prices. As a fundamental model, it incorporates estimates of future natural gas demand and supply to forecast prices. EEAs forecasts in 2004 indicated that the bulk of incremental new gas supply (i.e., the supply that is most capable of being increased) during the period 2005-2015 would come from liquified natural gas (LNG) imports. The expected amount of natural gas supply forecast by EEA was sufficient to meet the demand proposed by new natural gas-fired generating units, but insufficient to provide for significant conversion of existing coal-based generation to natural gas.
 
EEA was then asked to estimate the amount that LNG imports could feasibly be increased by 2015, and what impact that would have on the price of natural gas. EEAs analysis indicated that LNG imports could be increased by 1,500 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per year, or enough to provide for a 300-million tons/year reduction in U.S. CO emissions, roughly equivalent to the CO reduction required by the first stage of the 2003 McCain-Lieberman bill (S. 139). Since most legislation proposing CO regulation requires more stringent reductions of CO than the first stage of McCain-Lieberman, converting coal-based generation to burn natural gas is not a viable option.
2
2
2
2
 
Our belief that natural gas conversion is not sufficient to meet stringent CO reduction requirements is indirectly confirmed by the June 2003 EIA study  of the impacts of the McCain-Lieberman bill. The EIA study assumes that the CO reductions associated with electric generation required by the McCain-Lieberman bill are produced mainly by the following:

n 
Only moderate increases in natural gas-fired generation
 
FirstEnergy agrees that the reductions in electricity demand could result from higher electricity prices inherent with CO legislation. However, we are skeptical that the large increases in electric generation due to new nuclear generating units and generating units powered by gasified biomass assumed by EIA would be feasible. Consequently, we believe that the only way (if indeed there is any possible way) to achieve large reductions in CO emissions is through development, demonstration and commercial deployment of CO removal and sequestration technologies for coal-based generating units.

Customer Impacts of CO
2
Regulation
 
CO regulation is unlikely to occur until after the time when retail sales (at least the generation portion of them) in the states where FirstEnergy operates are scheduled to be fully deregulated. Because of this, determining the cost impacts of CO regulation on FirstEnergy customers is not a matter of calculating the costs associated with FirstEnergy generating units and allocating them to the electric sales within the FirstEnergy service areas. In a deregulated retail environment, FirstEnergy will have no defined generation customers, and the generation portion of the prices that customers pay, whether they are FirstEnergy customers or not, will be market-based and determined by regional generators costs to comply. This means that deregulated generation prices, while they will be affected by such factors as customer load factors or marketing costs, will be substantially determined by wholesale energy prices. Because of this, it is reasonable to assume that any increases in wholesale energy prices due to CO regulation will flow through into retail energy prices.
2
2
2
 
To estimate the cost impacts of CO regulation on FirstEnergy customers, therefore, it is necessary to determine the impact of CO regulation on average annual wholesale energy market prices. These cost impacts are then assumed to apply, on the average, to FirstEnergy retail customers.
2
2
 
 
FirstEnergy uses software developed by North-Bridge Group for EPRI to forecast wholesale energy market prices. This software involves dispatching all the generation within a forecast area, on an hour-by-hour basis, against the hourly load in that forecast region. Uncertainties in input variables, such as loads or fuel and emission prices, are handled by running 100 probabilistic scenarios.

To examine the price impacts of CO regulation, three potential CO emission allowance price scenarios were evaluated: a low-price forecast ($10/ton CO), a mid-price scenario ($25/ton CO) and a high-price scenario ($50/ton CO). The high-price scenario corresponds approximately to the cost, in 2015 dollars, of CO capture and seques-tration from a coal generating units flue gas using monoethanolamine (MEA) technology. The mid-price scenario is similar to the cost of CO reduction by natural gas conversion or using the ECO technology to remove CO from a coal units flue gas. (The costs for the MEA and ECO CO capture technologies are derived from the February 2005 DOE report, An Economic Scoping Study for CO Capture Using Aqueous Ammonia.) It should be noted, however, that neither MEA nor ECO capture technologies have been deployed on a commercial scale for power plants. Although few, if any, CO removal methods could reduce CO emissions for $10/ton CO, the low-price scenario could correspond to a CO tax. Average annual all-hours energy market prices were calculated for the Cinergy and PJM Western Hub market hubs. These market hubs are the major trading hubs in the vicinity of FirstEnergys generating units and thus should be indicative of the impacts on FirstEnergys future retail customers. The following figures show the increase in annual average energy market price for the three CO EEA price scenarios in the Cinergy and PJM Western Hub markets.

These graphs illustrate that customer cost impacts from CO regulation could be significant (3.5-4.5 cents per kWh) if the CO market price is as high as $50/ton CO. Even the mid-range CO price scenario results in customer cost increases on the order of 1.5-2.0 cents per kWh. Are CO prices likely to go this high? One indication is the CO emission allowance market in Europe, where all members of the European Union are signers of the Kyoto agreement. Thus far during 2005, European CO emission allowance prices have increased from approximately $10/ton CO to over $30/ton CO. This would imply that future U.S. CO prices would be at least in the mid-range of the prices analyzed. And thus far in Europe, generators have not had to incorporate expensive technology, such as CO capture and sequestration for coal units, to comply. Such technology is not yet commercially available. European CO prices seem likely to continue to rise, possibly to the $50/ton CO level estimated for coal unit CO removal.

The cost to FirstEnergy customers for CO compliance will of course depend greatly on the stringency of any CO regulations adopted. But the costs shown in the above two charts probably represent a reasonable range of costs that would result from CO regulation.

: Conclusion
 
At FirstEnergy, we are committed to protecting the environment while meeting our customers need for reliable and affordable electricity.
 
We take pride in our environmental achievements and expect to accomplish even more in the future. We remain active in collaborative projects to help our industry meet the growing needs for electricity, while also addressing environmental concerns.
 
Since the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, FirstEnergy companies have reduced emissions of NOx by more than 60 percent and SO by nearly 50 percent. Emissions of particulate matter also have declined due to replacements and upgrades of collection equipment. We have retired 57 aging and less efficient coal-based boilers from service, which represent nearly 1,900 megawatts of generation and together used more than three million tons of coal.
2
 
However, we acknowledge the need for even greater reductions. We plan to invest more than $1.5 billion over the next several years in environmental systems that will lead to additional, significant reductions in SO and NOx at our coal plants.
2
 
In addition, our diverse mix of generating resources - with our significant component of non-emitting nuclear capacity - places us in a strong position to meet future environmental requirements.
 
We also are taking steps to deal with global climate change and CO emissions. This report does not attempt to analyze differing scientific opinions about climate change. Rather, it acknowledges that there is growing scientific concern about climate change and seeks to provide an assessment of the impact greenhouse gas reductions may have on FirstEnergy, its customers and shareholders.
2
 
Because of global climate changes wide-ranging impact - including many different sectors of domestic and international economies - we believe the solutions should include specific targets for CO reductions and be driven by proven, commercially available technologies, not fractured and segmented by industry or country.
2
 
With coal-based electricity being abundant, reliable and less-costly than most other sources of electricity, we owe it to our customers and shareholders to continue our leadership role in helping to develop and deploy advanced clean-coal generating technologies. At the same time, we plan to continue pursuing renewable energy alternatives as part of our overall generation mix.
 
When it comes to FirstEnergys overall commitment to the environment, we hope this report will be viewed as a positive step in helping society develop effective public policies that achieve a proper balance among energy, economic and environmental objectives.

FirstEnergy has conducted an inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions. EPRI Solutions and Platts assisted in carrying out this work. The EPA Climate Leaders Greenhouse Gas Protocol (EPA Protocol) was selected as the primary guidance for our inventory. The EPA Protocol is based on The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a guidance document for corporate GHG inventory protocol developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The WRI GHG protocol is recognized as an international standard for corporate greenhouse gas accounting and reporting and is used by many GHG initiatives as a basis for registry, trading and reduction programs.
 
The GHG inventory for emissions from our sources was completed for the years 2001 through 2003. The sources included are all sources in which FirstEnergy has an ownership stake, with emissions calculated in proportion to equity interest. The source categories included are stationary combustion, mobile combustion, fugitive emissions and emissions from purchased power consumed by FirstEnergy facilities that are not located in FirstEnergys service territory. All emissions were converted to CO
2
equivalents.
 
Carbon dioxide emitted from fossil-fuel fired generation is the source of 98.1 percent of our GHG emissions. Emissions of SF
6
from transmission and distribution equipment accounted for 1.1 percent of the total. The remaining sources are minor by comparison. The table below shows the sources of the companys GHGs.

Following are brief profiles of the 15 clean-coal technology projects in which FirstEnergy companies have participated:
 
HALT
 
Hydrate Addition to Low Temperature, or HALT, humidified a 5-MW slipstream and injected lime to reduce SO
2
. Particulates were collected in an electrostatic precipitator.
 
LIMB/Coolside
 
This project developed Limestone Injection Multi-Stage Burner (LIMB) and low-NOx burner technology for both retrofit and new applications for wall-fired boilers. Variations of the LIMB technology, including humidification of the flue gas to improve SO
2
removal and precipitator performance, and the Coolside technology, which demonstrated in-duct lime
injection, also were developed.
 
Clean Coal Fuels Management
 
Clean Coal Fuels Management developed a personal computer-based model for utilities to evaluate the economics of a new strategy for controlling power plant SO
2
emissions in which multiple product-cleaned coal is fired in existing pulverized coal units and in new or retrofit fluidized bed combustion units.
 
E-SOX
 
E-SOX was a 5-MW slipstream pilot demonstration of an SO
2
removal system in which the first stage of an electrostatic precipitator was replaced by a chamber where a lime slurry was sprayed into the flue gas. Additionally, the particulates entering the remaining precipitator collectors were precharged to improve collection.
 
REBURN
 
REBURN demonstrated the injection of a secondary fuel in the furnace, creating a fuel-rich zone to reduce NOx by converting it to molecular nitrogen.

CCT Ash Utilization Study
 
The CCT Ash Utilization Study demonstrated high-volume, low-technology uses of dry FGD byproduct material, which could substitute for other materials that are utilized for land reclamation (abandoned acidic mine reclamation), agriculture, and soil stabilization.
 
NOXSO Pilot
 
The NOXSO pilot demonstrated a dry SO
2
/NOx removal system using a regenerable sorbent on a 5-MW slipstream. The flue gas passed through a fluidized bed of sorbent to remove SO
2
and NOx. Heat was used to regenerate the sorbent at high temperature with methane gas and steam.
 
SORBTECH Mag*Sorbent
 
SORBTECH Mag*Sorbent was a 2-MW slipstream pilot demonstration of a dry SO
2
/NOx removal system that uses a regenerable sorbent. Flue gas passes through a moving bed of sorbent, which removes pollutants. Sorbent is regenerated in a heating process.
 
SNRB
 
SNRB, or SOx-Nox-ROx-Box, demonstrated a flue gas cleanup process combining the removal of SO
2
, NOx, and particulates in one piece of equipment in a high temperature baghouse. SO
2
removal is accomplished using either calcium- or sodium-based sorbent injected into the flue gas. NOx is reduced to nitrogen and water by catalytic reaction with ammonia. Particulate removal is accomplished by high temperature ceramic-fiber bag filters. The project was installed on a 5 MW slipstream from a 156MW boiler.
SNOX
 
SNOX treated a flue gas equivalent of about 35 MW, reducing NOx by selective catalytic reduction and oxidizing SO
2
to SO
3
on a sulfuric acid catalyst in the SO
2
Reactor at high temperature.
SORBTECH Duct Injection
 
The SORBTECH Duct Injection pilot demonstrated an SO
2
removal system on a 2-MW slipstream by injecting a fine sorbent into a flue gas duct to reduce SO
2
with resulting fine particulates being collected by a cyclone and high pressure baghouse.

LS-2 Scrubber
 
The LS-2 Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization (WFGD) System (LS-2 Scrubber) incorporated improvements in spray tower and reaction tank design as well as other enhancements, which resulted in a compact system offering reduced capital and operating cost over conventional WFGD designs. The system had an equivalent capacity of 130 MW, scrubbing a portion of flue gas from two units at one of our plants (each rated at 125 MW). It utilized limestone as the scrubbing reagent and produced gypsum as a byproduct which was sold to a local company for commercial use.
 
Result: Demonstrated cost-effective SO
2
reduction as an alternative to fuel switching.
 
Forced Oxidation Gypsum (FOG)
 
FirstEnergys development of Forced Oxidized Gypsum (FOG) resulted in the largest recycling project in North America, a $30-million recycling facility at the companys Bruce Mansfield power plant that turns a typically unusable byproduct (calcium sulfite) of the facility's flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubber system into commercial-grade gypsum used to produce wallboard. FOG produces 100-percent synthetic gypsum from the calcium sulfite by injecting it with oxygen and removing fly ash from the scrubber slurry. Currently, a $50-million expansion of the facility will enable it to produce more than one million tons of commercial-grade gypsum annually beginning in mid-2006. Additional details can be found in Chapter 3 of this report.
 
Fluidized Bed Combustion
 
In 2001, the company replaced a 1950s-era coal-fired boiler at its Bay Shore Plant with a state-of-the-art circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler. The CFB boiler, which is designed to operate more efficiently and effectively than traditional coal-fired boilers, is fueled by petroleum coke, a waste byproduct of British Petroleums nearby Toledo Refinery. Additional details can be found in Chapter 3 of this report.
 
Electro-Catalytic OxidationTM (ECO) Technology
 
FirstEnergys R.E. Burger Plant is the site of a 50-MW commercial-scale demonstration of the Electro-Catalytic Oxidation
TM
, or ECO multi-pollutant control technology. This demonstration follows a successful pilot demonstration utilizing a 2-MW slipstream, also at the Burger Plant. ECO technology, which was developed by Powerspan Corp. of New Durham, New Hampshire, is designed to reduce emissions of SO
2
, NOx,
 
fine particulates, and mercury. The process also produces a valuable fertilizer co-product.
 
During the first year of operation, the commercial-scale ECO unit demonstrated greater than 99 percent SO
2
removal, 70-80 percent NOx removal, and 80 percent mercury removal. All fertilizer co-product (several thousand tons) has met commercial specifications. ECO commercial demonstration testing will conclude by the end of 2005. Additional details can be found in Chapter 3 of this report

Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate
Fact Sheet
Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs

July 28, 2005
 
Vision Statement of Australia, China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the U.S. for a New Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate
 
Development and poverty eradication are urgent and overriding goals internationally. The World Summit on Sustainable Development made clear the need for increased access to affordable, reliable and cleaner energy and the international community agreed in the Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainable Development on the importance of the development agenda in considering any climate change approach.
 
We each have different natural resource endowments, and sustainable development and energy strategies, but we are already working together and will continue to work to achieve common goals. By building on the foundation of existing bilateral and multilateral initiatives, we will enhance cooperation to meet both our increased energy needs and associated challenges, including those related to air pollution, energy security, and greenhouse gas intensities.
 
To this end, we will work together, in accordance with our respective national circumstances, to create a new partnership to develop, deploy and transfer cleaner, more efficient technologies and to meet national pollution reduction, energy security and climate change concerns, consistent with the principles of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
 
The partnership will collaborate to promote and create an enabling environment for the development, diffusion, deployment and transfer of existing and emerging cost-effective, cleaner technologies and practices, through concrete and substantial cooperation so as to achieve practical results. Areas for collaboration may include, but not be limited to: energy efficiency, clean coal, integrated gasification combined cycle, liquefied natural gas, carbon capture and storage, combined heat and power, methane capture and use, civilian nuclear power, geothermal, rural/village energy systems, advanced transportation, building and home construction and operation, bioenergy, agriculture and forestry, hydropower, wind power, solar power, and other renewables.
 
The partnership will also cooperate on the development, diffusion, deployment and transfer of longer-term transformational energy technologies that will promote economic growth while enabling significant reductions in greenhouse gas intensities. Areas for mid- to long-term collaboration may include, but not be limited to: hydrogen, nanotechnologies, advanced biotechnologies, next-generation nuclear fission, and fusion energy.
 
The partnership will share experiences in developing and implementing our national sustainable development and energy strategies, and explore opportunities to reduce the greenhouse gas intensities of our economies.
 
We will develop a non-binding compact in which the elements of this shared vision, as well as the ways and means to implement it, will be further defined. In particular, we will consider establishing a framework for the partnership, including institutional and financial arrangements and ways to include other interested and like-minded countries.
 
The partnership will also help the partners build human and institutional capacity to strengthen cooperative efforts, and will seek opportunities to engage the private sector. We will review the partnership on a regular basis to ensure its effectiveness.
 
The partnership will be consistent with and contribute to our efforts under the UNFCCC and will complement, but not replace, the Kyoto Protocol.

Excerpts from:
CHAIRS SUMMARY, GLENEAGLES SUMMIT, 8 JULY
Gleneagles Summit
We met at Gleneagles for our annual Summit, 6-8 July 2005.
 
Climate Change
 
 
We were joined for our discussion on climate change and the global economy by the leaders of Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa and by the heads of the International Energy Agency, International Monetary Fund, United Nations, World Bank, and the World Trade Organisation.
 
We have issued a statement setting out our common purpose in tackling climate change, promoting clean energy and achieving sustainable development.
 
All of us agreed that climate change is happening now, that human activity is contributing to it, and that it could affect every part of the globe.
 
We know that, globally, emissions must slow, peak and then decline, moving us towards a low-carbon economy. This will require leadership from the developed world.
 
We resolved to take urgent action to meet the challenges we face. The Gleneagles Plan of Action which we have agreed demonstrates our commitment. We will take measures to develop markets for clean energy technologies, to increase their availability in developing countries, and to help vulnerable communities adapt to the impact of climate change.
 
We warmly welcomed the involvement of the leaders of the emerging economy countries in our discussions, and their ideas for new approaches to international co-operation on clean energy technologies between the developed and developing world.
 
Our discussions mark the beginning of a new Dialogue between the G8 nations and other countries with significant energy needs, consistent with the aims and principles of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This will explore how best to exchange technology, reduce emissions, and meet our energy needs in a sustainable way, as we implement and build on the Plan of Action.
 
We will advance the global effort to tackle climate change at the UN Climate Change Conference in Montreal later this year. Those of us who have ratified the Kyoto Protocol remain committed to it, and will continue to work to make it a success.
