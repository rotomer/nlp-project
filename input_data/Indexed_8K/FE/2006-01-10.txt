EXHIBIT 99.1
 
Akron, OH - FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) announced that it will file a motion today requesting clarification related primarily to one aspect of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) January 4 order approving the companys Rate Certainty Plan (RCP).
The company is seeking clarity on issues related to distribution deferrals, including requirements of the review process, timing for booking of certain deferrals, and definitions of the types of expenditures that qualify. The company also is seeking confirmation that the list of distribution expenditures included in the revised stipulation - submitted in November 2005 - falls within the PUCO definition.
The RCP initially was supported by the cities of Cleveland, Akron, Toledo and Parma, the Industrial Energy Users - Ohio, and the Ohio Energy Group, and later supported by the Office of Consumers Counsel, Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, and Cleveland Housing Network and various other Cleveland-area consumer groups.
Under the companys plan, Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company and Toledo Edison customers are expected to pay essentially the same prices for electricity through 2008 as they paid in the mid-1990s. The RCP also provided for the company to postpone for future recovery fuel and distribution-related increases that otherwise could have occurred during the 2006 through 2008 period.
