Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 15, 2006, FirstEnergy Corp. issued two public announcements, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference. FirstEnergy's Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community contain non-GAAP* financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community of the non-GAAP* financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
The Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community include normalized earnings per share, which is not calculated in accordance with GAAP because it excludes the impact of "unusual items". Unusual items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are not routine, may be related to discontinued businesses or may be the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Management believes presenting normalized earnings calculated in this manner provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of FirstEnergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing the company's operating performance to the operating performance of other companies in the energy sector. The Consolidated Report to the Financial Community also includes references to free cash flow and cash generation which are not defined under GAAP. Management believes presenting these non-GAAP* measures provides useful information to investors in assessing FirstEnergy's normalized operating performance from a cash perspective. FirstEnergys management frequently references these non-GAAP* financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) Exhibits.
*This Form 8-K contains non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustment that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.
Forward-Looking Statements:
This Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements based on information currently available to management. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms "anticipate," "potential," "expect," "believe," "estimate" and similar words. Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased competition and deregulation in the electric utility industry, economic or weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices, replacement power costs being higher than anticipated or inadequately hedged, the continued ability of our regulated utilities to collect transition and other charges or to recover increased transmission costs, maintenance costs being higher than anticipated, legislative and regulatory changes (including revised environmental requirements), the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and the legal and regulatory changes resulting from the implementation of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the uncertainty of the timing and amounts of the capital expenditures (including that such amounts could be higher than anticipated) or levels of emission reductions related to the settlement agreement resolving the New Source Review litigation, adverse regulatory or legal decisions and outcomes (including, but not limited to, the revocation of necessary licenses or operating permits, fines or other enforcement actions and remedies) of governmental investigations and oversight, including by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Attorneys Office, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the various state public utility commissions as disclosed in the registrant's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, generally, and with respect to the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station outage and heightened scrutiny at the Perry Nuclear Power Plant in particular, the continuing availability and operation of generating units, the ability of generating units to continue to operate at, or near full capacity, the inability to accomplish or realize anticipated benefits from strategic goals (including employee workforce factors), the anticipated benefits from voluntary pension plan contributions, the ability to improve electric commodity margins and to experience growth in the distribution business, the ability to access the public securities and other capital markets and the cost of such capital, the outcome, cost and other effects of present and potential legal and administrative proceedings and claims related to the August 14, 2003 regional power outage, circumstances which may lead management to seek, or the Board of Directors to grant, in each case in its sole discretion, authority for the implementation of a share repurchase program in the future, the risks and other factors discussed from time to time in the registrant's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, and other similar factors. Dividends declared from time to time during any annual period may in aggregate vary from the indicated amounts due to circumstances considered by the Board at the time of the actual declarations. Also, a security rating should not be viewed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. The registrant expressly disclaims any current intention to update any forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

FirstEnergys retail generation sales for the year increased 5.2 percent - while total electric distribution deliveries increased 4.7 percent during the same period - producing i
mproved power generation margins. Lower operating costs in most business units and lower net interest charges also contributed positively to 2005 results.
Earnings were negatively impacted by higher prices the company paid in 2005 for fuel and purchased power compared to 2004, as well as by increased transmission costs related to PJM/MISO charges for congestion and ancillary services.
FirstEnergys generation fleet continued to show strong performance, posting a record output of 80.2 billion kilowatt-hours (KWH) in 2005, a 5-percent increase from the previous record of 76.4 billion KWH established in 2004. The increased output was attributable to higher fossil generation, which produced a record of 49.9 billion KWH.
The company made a voluntary $500-million contribution to its pension plan in December. The contribution represented a net after-tax cash outflow of approximately
$341 million and further increased the security of future plan benefits.
FirstEnergy continued to improve its financial flexibility through completion of its aggressive debt-reduction program. Total debt and preferred stock were reduced by approximate
ly $780 million in 2005, including the net
pension contribution that reduced a debt-like liability
. The company also refinanced or repriced an additional $758 million of long-term debt.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
Record Generation Output
In 2005, FirstEnergy set a generation output record of 80.2 million megawatt-hours, a 5% increase from the previous record of 76.4 million megawatt-hours established in 2004. The increased output was attributable to higher fossil generation, which also set a record of 49.9 million megawatt-hours.
 
Common Stock Dividend Increase
On November 15, 2005, FirstEnergys Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share on outstanding common stock, a 4.7% increase, payable March 1, 2006. The new indicated annual dividend will be $1.80 per share. This increase, coupled with dividend increases paid on March 1 and December 1, 2005, represents a combined increase of 20%. This latest action is consistent with our policy that targets sustainable annual dividend growth of 4% to 5% following 2005 and a targeted payout of 50% to 60% of earnings.
 
Voluntary Pension Plan Contribution
On December 23, 2005, FirstEnergy made a voluntary $500 million contribution to its pension plan. The net after-tax cash outlay was $341 million. This pre-funds future requirements that otherwise were anticipated prior to 2010. The funding is expected to be accretive to earnings by approximately $0.06 per share in 2006 and subsequent years. Following the contribution, the plan is fully funded on an Accumulated Benefit Obligation basis and 95% funded on a Projected Benefit Obligation basis.
Ohio Rate Certainty Plan
With entries on January 4 and 25, 2006, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved FirstEnergys Rate Certainty Plan. This will afford customers more certain rates through 2008 and provide the company with a stable and consistent earnings pattern, including the ability to defer up to $450 million of delivery system improvement expenditures for future recovery.
 
Intra-System Generation Asset Transfer
During the fourth quarter, Ohio Edison, The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, The Toledo Edison Company, and Pennsylvania Power Company, completed intra-system transfers of fossil and nuclear generation assets to FirstEnergy Generation Corp. and FirstEnergy Nuclear Generation Corp., respectively. The transferred assets exclude 1,254 MWs of leasehold interests in certain fossil and nuclear plants that are subject to sale and leaseback arrangements with non-affiliates.
 
Nuclear
Update
On January 20, 2006, FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) related to the reactor head issue at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station. Under the agreement, which expires December 31, 2006, the DOJ will refrain from seeking an indictment or otherwise initiating criminal prosecution of FENOC for all conduct related to the statement of facts attached to the deferred prosecution agreement, as long as FENOC remains in compliance with the agreement. FENOC agreed to pay a penalty of $28 million.
 
2006 Earnings and Cash Generation Guidance
On November 29, 2005, FirstEnergy announced that it was raising its 2006 earnings guidance (non-GAAP) by $0.05 per share to $3.45 to $3.65 per share, excluding any unusual items. FirstEnergy also increased its 2006 cash generation guidance (non-GAAP) to $460 million.
