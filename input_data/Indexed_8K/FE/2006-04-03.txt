See Item 2.03 below with respect to certain Guaranties of FirstEnergy referred to therein.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On April 3, 2006, FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy) entered into four separate guaranties (Guaranties) in connection with the issuance of four new series of pollution control revenue refunding bonds issued by the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) and the Beaver County Industrial Development Authority (BCIDA, and together with the OWDA, the Authorities) on behalf of FirstEnergys subsidiaries, FirstEnergy Generation Corp. (FGCO) and FirstEnergy Nuclear Generation Corp. (NGC, each a Company and collectively, the Companies), as follows (collectively, the Bonds):
 
 
The OWDA Bonds are each issued under a separate trust indenture dated as of April 1, 2006 between the OWDA and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and the BCIDA Bonds are each issued under a separate trust indenture dated as of April 1, 2006 between the BCIDA and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (each an Indenture, and collectively, the Indentures).
Principal or redemption price of and interest on, and purchase price of, each series of the Bonds is payable from a pledge of revenues derived by the applicable Authority pursuant to a separate loan agreement dated April 1, 2006 (each a Loan Agreement), between the applicable Authority and the applicable Company and a corresponding related unsecured promissory note between the applicable Company and the applicable trustee (each a Note).
Payment of the principal or redemption price of and interest on, and purchase price of, the Bonds of each series will be fully secured by a separate irrevocable, direct-pay letter of credit (each a Letter of Credit) delivered to the applicable trustee for each series of Bonds by Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), as Administrative Agent and Fronting Bank, under each Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of April 3, 2006 (each a Reimbursement Agreement), among the applicable Company, Barclays, KeyBank National Association, as syndication agent, and the banks parties thereto.
Each Letter of Credit will permit the applicable trustee to draw up to (a) an amount sufficient to pay the principal of the applicable Bonds or the portion of the purchase price corresponding to the principal of such Bonds, plus (b) an amount equal to 36 days interest accrued on the applicable Bonds, computed at a maximum rate of 10% per annum, to pay accrued and unpaid interest on such Bonds or the portion of the purchase price corresponding to accrued and unpaid interest on such Bonds. Each Letter of Credit will expire April 1, 2011 unless terminated earlier or extended in accordance with its terms. If a Letter of Credit is not extended, is cancelled or is replaced as described herein, the Bonds entitled to the benefit of that Letter of Credit will be subject to mandatory purchase prior to the cancellation, expiration or replacement of such Letter of Credit.
FirstEnergy delivered a separate Guaranty to Barclays pursuant to each Reimbursement Agreement. Under each Guaranty, FirstEnergy has agreed to guaranty the payment, performance and other obligations (but not collection) of the applicable Company under the corresponding credit documents. In certain circumstances relating to the attainment of investment grade credit ratings and specified levels of financial performance by FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES) or the applicable Company in the future, FirstEnergy may elect to have its obligations under each Guaranty reduced to zero.
From the date of issuance of the Bonds, each series will accrue interest at the Daily or Weekly Rate, as indicated above, determined by the applicable remarketing agent as set forth in the related Indenture. The method of determining the interest rate on the Bonds may be converted from time to time in accordance with the Indenture to a Daily Rate, a Weekly Rate, a Commercial Paper Rate, a Semi-Annual Rate, an Annual Rate, a Two-Year Rate, a Three-Year Rate, a Five-Year Rate, a Long Term Rate or a Dutch Auction Rate. The Bonds of each series will be subject to optional, extraordinary optional and special mandatory redemption prior to maturity, and to optional and mandatory tender for purchase and remarketing in certain circumstances described in the Indentures.

All of the proceeds of the Bonds were or will be used to refinance bonds previously issued by the Authorities on behalf of affiliates of the Companies to refinance the costs of construction and installation of certain air and water pollution control facilities, and sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at plants now owned by the Companies.
The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of each Note, Guaranty, Reimbursement Agreement, Indenture and Loan Agreement.
