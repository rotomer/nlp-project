TO THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY: 
1
 
On May 4, 2006, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) granted accounting authority for Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) and Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec), collectively the Companies, to defer certain incremental transmission charges during 2006. This letter provides additional details about the PUCs ruling.
 
Background
In January 2005, the Companies filed a petition with the PUC requesting authorization to defer, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, certain incremental transmission charges as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Specifically, the request was to defer, commencing January 1, 2005, the FERC-approved charges from the PJM Interconnection that are incremental to the levels currently reflected in the transmission component of the Companies base rate tariffs. The petition did not request any ratemaking authorization but stated that the Companies would address retail rate recovery of the deferred charges in a future rate-related filing.  
 
On April 10, 2006, the Companies filed a transition rate plan (Transition Plan) with the PUC, requesting general rate increases and several changes in regulatory accounting procedures (see the Letter to the Investment Community dated April 10, 2006 for additional details, available at www.firstenergycorp.com/ir). While the Transition Plan did not make any ratemaking claim for the incremental transmission charges for the 2005 period, the Companies did request that the actual 2006 incremental expenses be recognized through a ratemaking deferral.

PUC Order
The PUC Order allows the Companies to defer, commencing January 1, 2006, the FERC-approved charges from the PJM Interconnection that are incremental to the levels currently reflected in the transmission component of the Companies base rate tariffs. Consistent with the petition, the Order does not grant rate recovery of these costs but allows the Companies an opportunity to seek recovery in the pending Transition Plan filing. Accordingly, the Companies will implement deferral accounting for these costs in the second quarter of 2006, which will include approximately $28 million, representing the amounts that the Companies would have deferred in the first quarter of 2006. The deferral amounts in subsequent quarters depend on the level of actual PJM charges. These charges, especially congestion costs, are influenced by electricity demand, weather, fuel prices, generation availability and other factors. Had deferral accounting been authorized in 2005, the Companies would have deferred $143 million of incremental transmission costs.
Our current 2006 earnings guidance does not reflect deferral of these transmission expenses. Our general practice is to address annual earnings guidance at each quarterly earnings release. Therefore, we expect to address the earnings guidance impact of the PUC's action at the time of our second quarter 2006 earnings release.
PUC Action on Transition Plan Filing
As expected, the PUC also voted to assign the Transition Plan filing to a PUC administrative law judge for evidentiary hearings and a recommended decision. The PUC has until January 10, 2007 to make its final decision on this rate request.
