On August 10, 2006, FirstEnergy Corp. repurchased 10.6 million shares, or 3.2%, of its outstanding common stock at an initial price of $56.44, or a total initial purchase price of $600 million, pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement, dated August 9, 2006, with J.P.

The final purchase price is subject to a contingent purchase price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of the equivalent number of shares to be purchased by J.P. Morgan over a subsequent purchase period of up to seven months, as well as other purchase price adjustments in the event of an extraordinary cash dividend or other dilution events. The agreement may be terminated by J.P.

The agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and conditions and indemnification provisions.
FirstEnergy acquired these shares as part of its previously announced authorization to repurchase up to 12 million shares of its common stock. The acquisition, which will immediately reduce the base for calculating earnings per share, was funded with short-term debt.
