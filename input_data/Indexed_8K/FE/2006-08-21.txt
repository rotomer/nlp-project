Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously disclosed, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) recently conducted a review and audit of the January 2006 modification to the Non-Utility Generation (NUG) purchased power stranded cost accounting methodology for Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) and Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec). The modification increased Met-Eds and Penelecs deferred NUG cost balances by approximately $19.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively. On August 18, 2006, a PPUC Order was entered requiring Met-Ed and Penelec to reflect the deferred NUG cost balances as if the stranded cost accounting methodology modification had not been implemented in January 2006 and indicated that its Order is not intended to limit Met-Eds and Penelecs ability to petition for a modification from the accounting methodology used between January 1999 and January 2006. All of Penelecs incremental deferred NUG costs from the accounting methodology modification and approximately $8.7 million of Met-Eds incremental deferred NUG costs were incurred in periods prior to FirstEnergys acquisition of those companies in 2001 and were fully reserved upon implementation of the January 2006 modification. Therefore, as a result of the PPUCs latest Order, FirstEnergy and Met-Ed will recognize a pre-tax charge of approximately $10.3 million (approximately $6.0 million after income taxes -- $0.02 per share of FirstEnergy common stock) in the third quarter of 2006. FirstEnergy, Met-Ed and Penelec continue to believe that the stranded cost accounting methodology modification implemented in January 2006 is appropriate and plan to petition the PPUC pursuant to its Order for authorization to reflect the stranded cost accounting methodology modification effective January 1, 1999. There can be no assurance, however, as to the timing or success of any such petition.
