Item 4.02
(a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2006 and the Six Months Ended June 30, 2006
On October 27, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of FirstEnergy Corp. concluded that the previously issued consolidated financial statements of FirstEnergy Corp., Ohio Edison Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy) and Pennsylvania Power Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of Ohio Edison) for the three months ended March 31, 2006, and the six months ended June 30, 2006, as originally filed in their Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006, respectively, should not be relied upon due to a misclassification between cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from investing activities originally reported for those periods.
The Audit Committee further determined that the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the three months ended March 31, 2006, and the three months and six months ended June 30, 2006, and the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006, were not affected by the misclassification. Accordingly, revenues, net income, earnings per share of common stock and total assets reported for the respective periods remain unchanged. There is also no effect to FirstEnergys forecasted cash from operations for the year 2006.
The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prepared by Pennsylvania Power Company (Penn) for the three months ended March 31, 2006 misclassified the liquidation of $78 million of cash investments that had been restricted as of December 31, 2005, associated with the repayment of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2006, as cash from operating activities instead of cash from investing activities. That misclassification was carried forward in the preparation of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for Ohio Edison Company (OE) and FirstEnergy. The misclassification was not detected in the preparation of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for Penn, OE and FirstEnergy for the six months ended June 30, 2006, but was discovered by Penn during the preparation of its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. Management immediately began the process of assessing the materiality of the misclassification to the respective Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for Penn, OE and FirstEnergy, to determine whether the Forms 10-Q should be amended to reflect the correct classification.
The Audit Committee has discussed this matter with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Companies registered independent public accounting firm.
FirstEnergy, OE and Penn are filing this Form 8-K as required under the Exchange Act, within the time prescribed under the applicable regulations. The amended financial statements on Forms 10-Q/A for the quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006 for FirstEnergy, OE and Penn, related to the matter described above, were filed on November 1, 2006.
