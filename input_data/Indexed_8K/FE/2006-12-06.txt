On December
 5, 2006, FirstEnergy entered into arrangements for the delivery of eight separate letters of credit in connection with the issuance of eight new series of pollution control revenue refunding bonds issued by the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority (OAQDA), the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) and the Beaver County Industrial Development Authority (BCIDA, and together with the OAQDA and OWDA, the Authorities) on behalf of FirstEnergys subsidiaries, FirstEnergy Nuclear Generation Corp. (NGC) and FirstEnergy Generation Corp. (FGCO, each a Company and collectively, the Companies), as follows (collectively, the Bonds):
 
Proceeds
from the issuance and sale of the Bonds were or will be used to refund an equal aggregate amount of pollution control bonds previously issued in various series by the Authorities and the Lawrence County Industrial Development Authority for which FirstEnergys utility operating subsidiaries, Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company, The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company and The Toledo Edison Company, were obligors under corresponding pollution control notes. These refundings have resulted or will result in a corresponding reduction in each of the utility operating subsidiaries affiliate notes payables from NGC and FGCO relating to the generation asset transfers completed in 2005.
Each of the eight new series of Bonds
is issued under a separate trust indenture dated as of December 1, 2006 between the applicable Authority and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (each an Indenture, and collectively, the Indentures).
 
Principal or redemption price of and interest on, and purchase price of, each series of the Bonds is payable from a pledge of revenues derived by the applicable Authority pursuant to a separate loan agreement dated as of December 1, 2006 (each a Loan Agreement), between the applicable Authority and the applicable Company and a corresponding related unsecured promissory note between the applicable Company and the applicable trustee (each a Note). Payment of the principal or redemption price of and interest on, and purchase price of, each series of Bonds will be fully secured by a separate irrevocable, direct-pay letter of credit (each a Letter of Credit) delivered to the applicable trustee.

Each Letter of Credit for Bonds corresponding to NGC (each an NGC Letter of Credit) will be issued by Wachovia Bank, National Association (Wachovia), as Fronting Bank and Administrative Agent, under a Letter of Credit and Term Loan Agreement, dated as of December 5, 2006 (the NGC Reimbursement Agreement), between NGC and Wachovia.
 
In connection with the NGC Reimbursement Agreement, FirstEnergy delivered its guaranty (the NGC Guaranty) to Wachovia under which FirstEnergy has agreed to guaranty the payment, performance and other obligations (but not collection) of NGC under the NGC Reimbursement Agreement. Prior to January 31, 2007, the NGC Guaranty may be exchanged for a letter of credit to be issued by Wachovia on behalf of FirstEnergy under a master letter of credit facility to be entered into between FirstEnergy and an affiliate of Wachovia, which letter of credit would allow Wachovia to draw to cover reimbursement obligations of NGC with respect to draws under the NGC Letter of Credit.
 
Each Letter of Credit for the Bonds corresponding to FGCO (each an FGCO Letter of Credit) will be issued by Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), as Fronting Bank, under the $2.75 billion credit agreement, dated as of August 24, 2006 (the Credit Agreement), among FirstEnergy and certain other borrowers, the financial institutions from time to time party thereto, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, Barclays, as a Fronting Bank and certain other Fronting Banks and the Swing Line Lenders named therein, and a separate Supplemental Letter of Credit Agreement, dated as of December 5, 2006 (each an FGCO Supplemental LOC Agreement), among FirstEnergy, FGCO and Barclays. Under each FGCO Supplemental LOC Agreement, FGCO has agreed to guaranty the payment, performance and other obligations (but not collection) of FirstEnergy under the Credit Agreement with respect to the applicable FGCO Letter of Credit.
 
Each Letter of Credit will permit the trustee to draw up to (a) an amount sufficient to pay the principal of the applicable Bonds or the portion of the purchase price corresponding to the principal of such Bonds, plus (b) an amount equal to 36 days interest accrued on the applicable Bonds, computed at a maximum rate of 10% per annum, to pay accrued and unpaid interest on such Bonds or the portion of the purchase price corresponding to accrued and unpaid interest on such Bonds. Each NGC Letter of Credit and FGCO Letter of Credit will expire March 18, 2009 and December 3, 2007, respectively, unless terminated earlier or extended in accordance with its terms. If a Letter of Credit is not extended, is cancelled or is replaced as described herein, the applicable Bonds entitled to the benefit of that Letter of Credit will be subject to mandatory purchase prior to the cancellation, expiration or replacement of such Letter of Credit.
 
From the date of issuance of the Bonds, each series will accrue interest at the Daily or Weekly Rate, as indicated above, determined by the applicable remarketing agent as set forth in the related Indenture. The method of determining the interest rate on the Bonds may be converted from time to time in accordance with the Indenture to a Daily Rate, a Weekly Rate, a Commercial Paper Rate, a Semi-Annual Rate, an Annual Rate, a Two-Year Rate, a Three-Year Rate, a Five-Year Rate, a Long Term Rate or a Dutch Auction Rate. The Bonds of each series will be subject to optional, extraordinary optional and special mandatory redemption prior to maturity, and to optional and mandatory tender for purchase and remarketing in certain circumstances described in the Indentures.
 
The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of each applicable Note, Guaranty, Reimbursement Agreement, Indenture, Letter of Credit, Supplemental LOC Agreement and Loan Agreement.
