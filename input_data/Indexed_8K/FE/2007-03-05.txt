Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On March 2, 2007, FirstEnergy Corp. repurchased approximately 14.4 million shares, or 4.5%, of its outstanding common stock at an initial price of $62.63 per share, or a total initial purchase price of approximately $900 million, pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement, dated March 1, 2007, with Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited (
MSIL
). The final purchase price is subject to a contingent purchase price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of the equivalent number of shares to be purchased by MSIL over a subsequent purchase period of up to approximately one year, as well as other purchase price adjustments in the event of an extraordinary cash dividend or other dilution events. The agreement may be terminated by MSIL under certain circumstances including a share de-listing event, certain merger events, nationalization, insolvency or a distribution termination event as those terms are described in the agreement. The agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and conditions and indemnification provisions.
FirstEnergy acquired these shares under its previously announced authorization to repurchase up to 16 million additional shares of its common stock. Under a prior authorized program, FirstEnergy repurchased approximately 10.5 million shares of its outstanding common stock on August 10, 2006, under an accelerated share repurchase agreement, dated August 9, 2006, with another financial institution. That financial institution provided its consent to FirstEnergys execution and delivery of the new agreement with MSIL.
The latest share repurchase was funded with short-term borrowings, including a $250 million 90-day bridge loan facility, dated as of March 2, 2007, provided by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (MSSF) to FirstEnergy. Concurrently, FirstEnergys wholly owned subsidiary, FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES), entered into a substantially similar $250 million bridge loan facility with MSSF. FirstEnergy provided a guaranty of FES bridge loan obligations until such time as FES has provided the lender with notice that its senior unsecured debt is rated at least BBB- by Standard & Poors or Baa3 by Moodys.
Loans drawn under each bridge loan facility will bear interest at a rate per annum based on one-, two-, or three-month LIBOR plus 0.65% and must be repaid within 90 days, which period may be extended for an additional 30 days at the option of the applicable borrower. In addition, each bridge loan is required to be prepaid promptly upon the receipt of cash proceeds by any FirstEnergy subsidiary from the planned sale and leaseback transaction of the owned portion of Unit 1 of the Bruce Mansfield Plant.
Except as set forth above, the facilities contain representations, warranties, terms and conditions that are customary for facilities of this type and are substantially similar to those contained in the existing $2.75 billion syndicated revolving credit facility, dated August 24, 2006, among FirstEnergy, certain of its subsidiaries (including FES) and the banks named therein.
FirstEnergy, FES and certain of their affiliates maintain ordinary banking and investment banking relationships with affiliates of MSIL and MSSF. MSSF is a lender under the August 24, 2006 credit facility referred to above.
Attached as Exhibit 99.1 is FirstEnergys press release issued March 2, 2007 regarding the execution and delivery of the accelerated share repurchase agreement with MSIL.
