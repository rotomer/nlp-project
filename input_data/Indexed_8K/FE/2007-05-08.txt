TO THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY:

Today, FirstEnergy Corp.s Ohio utility subsidiaries Ohio Edison Company (OE), The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), and The Toledo Edison Company (TE) notified the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) of their intention to file for an increase in base distribution rates. The filing is expected to be made on or after June 7, 2007 with a decision expected by early next year. The new rates would be effective January 1, 2009, for OE and TE customers, and are expected to be effective in May 2009 for CEI customers.
The Companies are requesting an increase in distribution revenue totaling $334 million to recover expenses related to distribution operations and costs deferred under previously approved rate plans. At the time the new distribution rates are implemented, the Companies expect annual transition cost revenues to be reduced as transition cost recovery, and related expense amortization, is completed for OE and TE and CEIs recovery continues through 2010, in accordance with its Rate Certainty Plan. The net effect of these two rate changes would be a total annual decrease of $208 million for the regulated portion of customer bills.
The last retail base rate proceedings that included adjustments to base distribution rates were based on a 1990 rate order for OE and a 1996 rate order for CEI and TE. Since those proceedings, the Companies have been granted the authority to defer and capitalize for future recovery certain costs for
 
distribution infrastructure and reliability, fuel costs, Ohio line extensions, transition taxes and energy efficiency programs. Additions to these deferrals will end on December 31, 2008, and the recovery periods reflected in the proposed distribution rates range from 3 to 25 years. Additional details of the distribution rate changes will be available in our comprehensive filing with the PUCO on or after June 7, 2007.
Under Ohios electric choice law, generation prices in the companies current rates will be replaced in 2009, and will be based on the competitive market price for generation service at that time. As a result, customers overall bills may be higher, lower or about the same as they are today.

While the effect on customers bills would depend on their specific residential or general service rate and monthly use, the tables below outline the potential impact on typical residential customer bills.
*Includes current generation charge, which may change when bills reflect the 2009 competitive market price.
 
 
OE, CEI and TE are spending nearly $1 billion a year to enhance service to customers. These investments include devices that are designed to reduce the number and duration of customer outages; technologies such as state-of-the-art system control centers; and an automated phone system to help the companies respond quicker and provide customers more accurate restoration estimates when outages occur.
These investments have helped reduce the number of Ohio customers affected by outages. About 500,000 fewer customers experienced outages in 2006, and the total duration of outages was down more than 20 percent compared to the previous year. And, the trend continued in the first quarter of 2007 with nearly 145,000 fewer Ohio customers experiencing outages and the total duration of outages decreasing by an average of 33 percent, compared to the same period last year.
