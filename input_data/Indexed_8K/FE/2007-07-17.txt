Following the public meeting that was held on June 27, 2007 to discuss the Demand for Information (DFI), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) to provide the following additional information regarding:
Deletion of Safety Implications Discussion that was included in the draft report reviewed by FENOC but removed prior to Issuance of Final Exponent Report
Attachment 1 of the FENOC response to the DFI that was submitted to the NRC on June 13, 2007 contains the following statement on page 5 of 55:
During this review of the draft Exponent Report, FENOC executive management raised the question whether the report could have possible safety implications.  Senior Counsel relayed information related to Exponents conclusion that its analysis did not raise a safety concern and that the industry inspection guidance is adequate.  Staff involved with the drafting of the Technical Root Cause Report likewise commented on the difference in the corrosion/wastage timeline.
The draft Exponent Report that circulated within FENOC for review explained that if the current NRC-ordered inspections had been in place at 12RFO [twelfth refueling outage] in 2000, the cracks in CRDM [Control Rod Drive Mechanism] nozzles would have been identified and repaired and the head wastage would not have happened.  This explanation was not included in the formal report because it was part of a larger section that was condensed prior to issuing the final report.
The explanation provided in the draft report that was reviewed by FENOC, but subsequently removed prior to issuance of the final report, is as follows:
 
We [Exponent] show in Section 8 that at the 2000 refueling outage (12RFO), Davis-Besse almost certainly had PWSCC [Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking] through wall cracks on nozzle 2 and 3 (see Section 8).  We believe that at that outage, the cracks were short enough that leakage through them would have been minimal, likely of the order of the leakage observed for similar size cracks at the Oconee-3 plant in February 2001.  Therefore, just a visual inspection might have missed the leakage, even had the head been clean with little or no pre-existing deposits of boric acid from CRDM flange leaks.

However, such cracks would have been readily detected by either UT [Ultrasonic Testing] or ECT [Eddy-Current Testing], and if the EA-03-009 order had been in place in 2000, those cracks would have been identified and repaired, and the Davis-Besse wastage would not have happened.
This discussion was not included in the final Exponent Report because it was determined not to be relevant to the issues in the insurance arbitration.  The removal of this quotation should not be construed to be a change of position by Exponent.  During telephone conferences with the NRC held in March 2007, Exponent stated that the cracks would have been detected in 2000 if the current inspection regime would have been in place at that time.
The Role of Senior Counsel in Providing Information from the Authors of the Exponent Report to the FENOC Chief Nuclear Officer
The safety implications of the Exponent Report were discussed among Exponent, FirstEnergy Legal Department, and outside counsel during the review of the draft Exponent Report in December 2006.  During these discussions, Exponent reiterated their view that the results of their analysis showing faster crack growth rates did not raise a safety concern because the NRCs current inspection requirements for the reactor pressure vessel head nozzles were adequate to detect cracking in the nozzles calculated to occur at Davis-Besse.  The results of these conversations were relayed to the Chief Nuclear Officer (CNO).
 
As discussed in Attachment 1 to the FENOC Response to the Demand for Information, the senior counsel served as a conduit for information between Exponent and the CNO.  The CNO and senior counsel discussed whether Exponent believed that its report raised safety concerns or called into question the NRC inspection requirements for the reactor pressure vessel head.  Exponent concluded that no safety concern existed at Davis-Besse from the development of the Exponent Report because of the crack growth rates calculated.  Based on discussions between Exponent and senior counsel as relayed to the CNO, the CNO understood that Exponent was an expert in the field, had considered these issues, and had concluded that its analysis neither raised a safety concern nor adversely affected the NRCs inspection requirements.

Some of the activities described below are inter-related and apply to more than one commitment.  For example, one benchmarking survey and one root cause will be conducted, but they apply to several of the commitments described below.  The activities described in the implementation steps are not commitments, but represent the current plans to meet the commitments.
The due dates for the commitments were chosen based on the need to complete the root cause evaluation, benchmark with other utilities, develop procedural guidance and training, conduct the training, and the issuance of the final process.  Interim actions have been put in place and will remain in effect until the procedural guidance is approved.
COMMITMENT 1
FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) will develop a formal process to review technical reports prepared as a part of a commercial matter.  The process will provide criteria for FENOC to utilize to determine if the report has the potential for regulatory implications or impact on nuclear safety both at our sites and within the nuclear industry.  This process will provide for the timely and critical evaluation of this type of report and will complement our existing formal nuclear process for obtaining technical reports from our agents and contractors.
