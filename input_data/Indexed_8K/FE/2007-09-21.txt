On September 18, 2007, FirstEnergy Corp. (Company) adopted amendments to the FirstEnergy Corp. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDCP) and the FirstEnergy Corp. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP).  Primarily, these plans were amended and restated in order to comply with the requirements and final regulations of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Section 409A).  The summary description below is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the plan documents themselves.
Unless otherwise specified, the amendments apply to post-2004 deferrals.  These amendments include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Also, Article 6 of the EDCP providing for supplemental pension benefits was amended.  The following changes apply to current and future retirees who have accrued a post-2004 supplemental pension benefit:
Also, on September 18, 2007 the Companys Board of Directors approved written amendments to the SERP.  Again, primarily the SERP was amended to add conforming language required by Section 409A.  In addition, the language of the SERP was also modified so that married participants could elect a 50% qualified spousal annuity.  This change was instituted to remain current with competitive practice.  There are no further material changes to the plan other than the implementation of a six-month payment restriction after separation from service for specified highly compensated employees.
