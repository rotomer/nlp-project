Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 31, 2008, FirstEnergy Corp. (Company) adopted amendments to all outstanding agreements providing for the grant of benefits (Award Agreements) under the FirstEnergy Corp. 2007 Incentive Plan (ICP). The ICP permits the award of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. The Award Agreements under the ICP constitute compensatory arrangements to certain officers of the Company including the Chief Executive Officer and certain other members of senior management including some of the named executive officers.
Primarily, the Award Agreements were amended in order to obtain or preserve compliance with, or exemption from, the requirements and final regulations of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Section 409A). The amendments to the Award Agreements do not materially affect the scope or amount of benefits the officers are entitled to receive under their respective awards, but may affect the time and form of payment.
These amendments include:
The above description of the amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of agreement to be filed as an exhibit to FirstEnergys Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.
This Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements based on information currently available to management. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These statements include declarations regarding managements intents, beliefs and current expectations.  These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words.  Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased competition in the electric utility industry and legislative and regulatory changes affecting how generation rates will be determined following the expiration of existing rate plans in Ohio and Pennsylvania, the impact of the PUCOs regulatory process on the Ohio Companies associated with the Electric Security Plan and Market Rate Offer filings, including any resultant mechanism under which rates charged to retail customers may not fully recover the costs of energy supply, or the outcome of any competitive procurement process in Ohio to allow the Ohio Companies to provide energy supply for their customers, economic or weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices and availability, replacement power costs being higher than anticipated or inadequately hedged, the continued ability of FirstEnergys regulated utilities to collect transition and other charges or to recover increased transmission costs, maintenance costs being higher than anticipated, other legislative and regulatory changes, revised environmental requirements, including possible greenhouse gas emission regulations, the potential impacts of the U.S. Court of Appeals July 11, 2008 decision requiring revisions to the CAIR rules and the scope of any laws, rules or regulations that may ultimately take their place, the uncertainty of the timing and amounts of the capital expenditures needed to, among other things, implement the Air Quality Compliance Plan (including that such amounts could be higher than anticipated or that certain generating units may need to be shut down) or levels of emission reductions related to the Consent Decree resolving the New Source Review litigation or other potential regulatory initiatives, adverse regulatory or legal decisions and outcomes (including, but not limited to, the revocation of necessary licenses or operating permits and oversight) by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (including, but not limited to, the Demand for Information issued to FENOC on May 14, 2007), the timing and outcome of various proceedings before the PUCO (including, but not limited to the distribution rate cases and the generation supply plan filing for the Ohio Companies and the successful resolution of the issues remanded to the PUCO by the Ohio Supreme Court regarding the Rate Stabilization Plan and the Rate Certainty Plan, including the recovery of deferred fuel costs), Met-Eds and Penelecs transmission service charge filings with the PPUC, the continuing availability of generating units and their ability to operate at or near full capacity, the ability to comply with applicable state and federal reliability standards, the ability to accomplish or realize anticipated benefits from strategic goals (including employee workforce initiatives), the ability to improve electric commodity margins and to experience growth in the distribution business, the changing market conditions that could affect the value of assets held in FirstEnergys nuclear decommissioning trusts, pension trusts and other trust funds, and cause FirstEnergy to make additional contributions sooner, or in an amount that is larger than currently anticipated, the ability to access the public securities and other capital and credit markets in accordance with FirstEnergys financing plan and the cost of such capital, changes in general economic conditions affecting FirstEnergy, the state of the capital and credit markets affecting FirstEnergy, and the risks and other factors discussed from time to time in its SEC filings, and other similar factors.  The foregoing review of factors should not be construed as exhaustive.  New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor assess the impact of any such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.   The registrant expressly disclaims any current intention to update any forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
