Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure.
As was previously announced, on January 2, 2009, Ohio Edison Company (OE), The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI) and The Toledo Edison Company (TE) (collectively, the Ohio Companies) conducted a successful competitive bidding process to ensure that their retail customers continue to have a reliable supply of electricity.  The solicitation provided the wholesale capacity and energy requirements the Ohio Companies need to serve their retail load for the period January 5, 2009 through March 31, 2009.  The Ohio Companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of FirstEnergy Corp.
The competitive bidding process, which was conducted on December 31, 2008, was managed by CRA International, a global consulting firm with expertise in energy markets and procurement.  CRA International reported that four qualified bidders were selected to supply electric generation for the period of January 5 through March 31, 2009.  The average winning bid price was equivalent to a retail rate of 6.98 cents per kilowatt-hour.  The power supply obtained through the competitive solicitation will be used to provide generation service to retail customers who choose not to shop with alternative suppliers.
FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES), a wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy and an affiliate of the Ohio Companies, was the successful bidder for 75 of the available tranches up for bid.  Each tranche equals approximately 1% of the total load of the Ohio Companies. Approximately 50% of FES estimated electric sales for the first quarter of 2009 are expected to be supplied under this agreement.
A similar bid process is being planned to obtain the Ohio Companies power supply beyond March 31, 2009.
The RFP was conducted following the denial by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) of the Ohio Companies Market Rate Offer (MRO) filing and the PUCOs recent order that significantly altered the Ohio Companies Electric Security Plan (ESP).  On December 22, 2008, the Ohio Companies withdrew their ESP application, as allowed for under Senate Bill 221, and separately asked the PUCO for rehearing of the MRO.

This Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements based on information currently available to management. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These statements include declarations regarding managements intents, beliefs and current expectations.  These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words.  Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially due to the speed and nature of increased competition in the electric utility industry and legislative and regulatory changes affecting how generation rates will be determined following the expiration of existing rate plans in Ohio and Pennsylvania, the impact of the PUCOs regulatory process on the Ohio Companies associated with the Electric Security Plan and Market Rate Offer filings, including any resultant mechanism under which rates charged to retail customers may not fully recover the costs of energy supply (including, but not limited to, Regulatory Transition Charges and fuel charges), or the outcome of any competitive procurement process in Ohio to allow the Ohio Companies to provide energy supply for their customers, economic or weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices and availability, replacement power costs being higher than anticipated or inadequately hedged, the continued ability of FirstEnergys regulated utilities to collect transition and other charges or to recover increased transmission costs, maintenance costs being higher than anticipated, other legislative and regulatory changes, revised environmental requirements, including possible greenhouse gas emission regulations, the potential impacts of the U.S. Court of Appeals July 11, 2008 decision requiring revisions to the CAIR rules and the scope of any laws, rules or regulations that may ultimately take their place, the uncertainty of the timing and amounts of the capital expenditures needed to, among other things, implement the Air Quality Compliance Plan (including that such amounts could be higher than anticipated or that certain generating units may need to be shut down) or levels of emission reductions related to the Consent Decree resolving the New Source Review litigation or other potential regulatory initiatives, adverse regulatory or legal decisions and outcomes (including, but not limited to, the revocation of necessary licenses or operating permits and oversight) by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (including, but not limited to, the Demand for Information issued to FENOC on May 14, 2007), the timing and outcome of various proceedings before the PUCO (including, but not limited to the distribution rate cases and the generation supply plan filing for the Ohio Companies and the successful resolution of the issues remanded to the PUCO by the Ohio Supreme Court regarding the Rate Stabilization Plan and the Rate Certainty Plan, including the recovery of deferred fuel costs), Met-Eds and Penelecs transmission service charge filings with the PPUC, the continuing availability of generating units and their ability to operate at or near full capacity, the ability to comply with applicable state and federal reliability standards, the ability to accomplish or realize anticipated benefits from strategic goals (including employee workforce initiatives), the ability to improve electric commodity margins and to experience growth in the distribution business, the changing market conditions that could affect the value of assets held in FirstEnergys nuclear decommissioning trusts, pension trusts and other trust funds, and cause FirstEnergy to make additional contributions sooner, or in an amount that is larger than currently anticipated, the ability to access the public securities and other capital and credit markets in accordance with FirstEnergys financing plan and the cost of such capital, changes in general economic conditions affecting FirstEnergy, the state of the capital and credit markets affecting FirstEnergy, and the risks and other factors discussed from time to time in its SEC filings, and other similar factors.  The foregoing review of factors should not be construed as exhaustive.  New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor assess the impact of any such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.   The registrants expressly disclaim any current intention to update any forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
