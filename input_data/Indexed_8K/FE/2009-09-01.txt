Item 8.01 Other Events.
On September 1, 2009, FirstEnergy Corp. issued a press release announcing the expiration of its previously announced cash Tender Offer for $1,200,000,000 aggregate principal amount (Tender Cap) of its 6.45% Notes, Series B, Due 2011 (Notes), as specified in the Offer to Purchase dated August 4, 2009, and amended by the press release issued by FirstEnergy on August 18, 2009.  The Tender Offer expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on August 31, 2009 (Expiration Time).  According to information provided by the Tender Agent, as of the Expiration Time, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer was $1,256,369,000.  Because the aggregate principal amount of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time is in excess of the Tender Cap, FirstEnergy Corp. will purchase all Notes accepted in the Tender Offer on a pro rata basis among the tendering holders, as described in the Offer to Purchase.  Settlement occurred on September 1, 2009.  
As a result of the Tender Offer, FirstEnergy expects to recognize $136 million ($88 million after-tax, or 29 cents per share of common stock) of debt redemption costs in the third quarter of 2009.
 
A copy of FirstEnergys press release announcing the tender results and the amendments to the Tender Offer is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated by reference.
