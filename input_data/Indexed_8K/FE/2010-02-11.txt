On February 10, 2010, FirstEnergy Corp. ("FirstEnergy"), Element Merger Sub, Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy ("Merger Sub") and Allegheny Energy, Inc. ("Allegheny") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). The following description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of FirstEnergy and Allegheny, Merger Sub will merge with and into Allegheny (the "Merger"), with Allegheny continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy. The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and be tax-free to Allegheny stockholders.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the closing of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Allegheny common stock, including grants of restricted common stock, will automatically be converted into the right to receive 0.667 of a share of common stock of FirstEnergy (the "Exchange Ratio").
All options to purchase shares of Allegheny common stock under Allegheny's stock plans, whether vested or unvested, will automatically be converted into options to acquire a number of shares of FirstEnergy common stock as adjusted for the Exchange Ratio at an equitably adjusted option price and otherwise on the same terms and conditions. All awards of Allegheny restricted stock that have not already vested in accordance with their terms as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger will automatically be converted into the right to receive similarly restricted shares of FirstEnergy common stock based on the Exchange Ratio. Likewise, any performance shares and restricted stock units that have not already vested in accordance with their terms as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger will automatically be converted into performance shares or stock units in respect of FirstEnergy common stock based on the Exchange Ratio as equitably adjusted as appropriate to reflect resulting changes in their underlying terms.
Upon the closing of the Merger, FirstEnergy's Board of Directors will be increased from 11 to 13 members, and two of Allegheny's current Board members will be appointed to FirstEnergy's Board. Paul J. Evanson will become the Executive Vice Chairman of FirstEnergy following the closing of the Merger.
Completion of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including, among others, (i) requisite approvals of FirstEnergy and Allegheny stockholders, (ii) effectiveness of the registration statement for the FirstEnergy common stock to be issued in the Merger, (iii) expiration or termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period, (iv) receipt of all required regulatory approvals from, among others, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and certain state public service and utility commissions, (v) the absence of any governmental action challenging or seeking to prohibit the Merger and (vi) the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to either FirstEnergy or Allegheny. FirstEnergy's obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to the condition that Allegheny shall have received consents from its lenders under certain credit facilities.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of FirstEnergy and Allegheny, including, among others, covenants (i) to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and completion of the Merger, (ii) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during this interim period, (iii) to hold a stockholder meeting to put these matters before their stockholders for their consideration and (iv) to use their reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to obtain all governmental and regulatory approvals, subject to certain limitations. Each of FirstEnergy and Allegheny is also subject to a "no shop" restriction on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals, provide information and engage in discussion with third parties, except under limited circumstances to permit FirstEnergy's or Allegheny's board of directors to comply with its fiduciary duties.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both FirstEnergy and Allegheny and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Allegheny may be required to pay FirstEnergy a termination fee of $150 million and FirstEnergy may be required to pay Allegheny a termination fee of $350 million and, in each case, reimburse the other party for up to $45 million of its reasonable out-of-pocket transaction expenses. The Merger Agreement also provides that under specified circumstances where a termination fee is not otherwise payable, Allegheny or FirstEnergy may be required to reimburse the non-terminating party for up to $45 million of its reasonable out-of-pocket transaction expenses.
The Merger Agreement has been included to provide security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about FirstEnergy or Allegheny. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by each of the parties to the Merger Agreement. These representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the other parties to the Merger Agreement and were (i) not intended to be treated as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to inaccurate, (ii) may have been qualified in the Merger Agreement by disclosures that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the applicable agreement, (iii) may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the parties that differ from what might be viewed as material to stockholders and (iv) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in the Merger Agreement. Stockholders should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of FirstEnergy or Allegheny.

AKRON, OH and GREENSBURG, PA
Under the terms of the agreement, Allegheny shareholders would receive 0.667 shares of FirstEnergy common stock in exchange for each share of Allegheny they own. Based on the closing stock prices for both companies on February 10, 2010, Allegheny shareholders would receive a value of $27.65 per share, or $4.7 billion in the aggregate. FirstEnergy will also assume approximately $3.8 billion in Allegheny net debt. The price per share represents a premium of 31.6 percent to the closing stock price of Allegheny on February 10, 2010, and a 22.3 percent premium to the average stock price of Allegheny over the last 60 days ending February 10, 2010. Following the completion of the merger, it is anticipated that FirstEnergy shareholders would own approximately 73 percent and Allegheny shareholders would own approximately 27 percent of the combined company.

"The combination of our companies is a natural fit that will accelerate our efforts to strengthen the operating performance of our generating fleet while building on our long-standing dedication
to customers, shareholders and employees," said Anthony J. Alexander, president and chief executive officer of FirstEnergy. "This transaction will provide outstanding value to both companies' shareholders  offering enhanced earnings growth potential and a more competitive cost structure. Among other benefits, it would increase generation resources by 70 percent, more than double the amount of supercritical coal capacity, improve the overall environmental performance of the generation fleet, and increase our customer base by 35 percent. We also expect to create significant efficiencies and economies of scale as we share best practices across the new organization.
"This combination supports our strategy of being a leading regional energy provider, focused on both regulated utility operations and our competitive generation business," Mr. Alexander said. "Simply put, it provides a far better platform for growth than either company would have been capable of achieving on a stand-alone basis."
Paul J. Evanson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Allegheny, said, "This transaction significantly enhances value for our shareholders, who will receive both a meaningful premium and a substantial increase in the dividend based on FirstEnergy's current practice. The combined company will have substantial upside potential with increased scale and a more diverse generation fleet. We plan on working closely with FirstEnergy to integrate the businesses while maintaining both companies' long-standing focus on reliability, customer service, quality and safety."
