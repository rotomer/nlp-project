Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On September 21, 2010, FirstEnergy Corp.'s Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the FirstEnergy Corp. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDCP) - a plan for various management employees, including our named executive officers.  The amendment eliminates the 20 percent Stock Premium credited for compensation deferred by the participant into FirstEnergy stock, which could include up to 100 percent of short-term incentive awards and up to 100 percent of the performance share portion of long-term incentive awards.  On the same date, the Board also adopted a similar amendment to the FirstEnergy Corp. Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors (DDCP) that eliminates the 20 percent Bonus Credit for directors fees deferred into FirstEnergy stock.  These amendments will be effective on January 1, 2011 .
The above descriptions of the amendments to the EDCP and DDCP are qualified in their entirety by reference to the amended plans that will be filed as exhibits to FirstEnergy's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto authorized.
