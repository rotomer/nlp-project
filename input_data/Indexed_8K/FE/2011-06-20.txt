Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure
 
On March 3, 2010, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC) entered an order denying Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) and Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec), both wholly owned subsidiaries of FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy), the ability to recover marginal transmission losses through the transmission service charge riders in their respective tariffs for the period from June 1, 2007 through March 31, 2008. In separate filings at the PPUC, Met-Ed and Penelec (Companies) sought to recover marginal transmission losses for periods including June 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010.  In April 2010, the Companies filed a Petition for Review with the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania (Commonwealth Court) appealing the PPUCs March 3, 2010 order.
On June 14, 2011, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the PPUCs decision that the marginal transmission losses are not recoverable as transmission costs.  The Companies plan to appeal the Commonwealth Courts decision by filing a Petition for Allowance of Appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and to seek relief from the Federal District Court.  Although the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, Met-Ed and Penelec believe that the Commonwealth Courts decision contradicts federal law and is inconsistent with prior PPUC and court decisions and therefore expect to fully recover the related regulatory assets ($189 million for Met-Ed and $65 million for Penelec).  Consequently, t
here are currently no changes to FirstEnergy's 2011 estimated earnings per share of common stock or cash from operating activities as a result of this matter.
 
This Form 8-K includes forward-looking statements based on information currently available to management. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These statements include declarations regarding managements intents, beliefs and current expectations. These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms anticipate, potential, expect, believe, estimate and similar words. Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially due to: the speed and nature of increased competition in the electric utility industry, the impact of the regulatory process on the pending matters in the various states in which we do business including, but not limited to, matters related to rates, the status of the PATH project in light of PJM's direction to suspend work on the project pending review of its planning process, its re-evaluation of the need for the project and the uncertainty of the timing and amounts of any related capital expenditures, business and regulatory impacts from ATSIs realignment into PJM Interconnection, L.L.C, economic or weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices and availability, financial derivative reforms that could increase our liquidity needs and collateral costs, replacement power costs being higher than anticipated or inadequately hedged, the continued ability of FirstEnergys regulated utilities to collect transition and other costs, operation and maintenance costs being higher than anticipated, other legislative and regulatory changes, and revised environmental requirements, including possible GHG emission, water intake and coal combustion residual regulations, the potential impacts of any laws, rules or regulations that ultimately replace CAIR and the effects of the EPAs recently released MACT proposal to establish certain mercury and other emission standards for electric generating units, the uncertainty of the timing and amounts of the capital expenditures that may arise in connection with any NSR litigation or potential regulatory initiatives or rulemakings (including that such expenditures could result in our decision to shut down or idle certain generating units), adverse regulatory or legal decisions and outcomes (including, but not limited to, the revocation of necessary licenses or operating permits) and oversight by the NRC, including as a result of the incident at Japans Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant, adverse legal decisions and outcomes related to Met-Eds and Penelecs ability to recover certain transmission costs through their transmission service charge riders, the continuing availability of generating units and changes in their ability to operate at or near full capacity, the ability to comply with applicable state and federal reliability standards and energy efficiency mandates, changes in customers demand for power, including but not limited to, changes resulting from the implementation of state and federal energy efficiency mandates, the ability to accomplish or realize anticipated benefits from strategic goals, efforts, and our ability to improve electric commodity margins and the impact of, among other factors, the increased cost of coal and coal transportation on such margins, the ability to experience growth in the distribution business, the changing market conditions that could affect the value of assets held in FirstEnergys nuclear decommissioning trusts, pension trusts and other trust funds, and cause FirstEnergy to make additional contributions sooner, or in amounts that are larger than currently anticipated, the ability to access the public securities and other capital and credit markets in accordance with FirstEnergys financing plan, the cost of such capital and overall condition of the capital and credit markets affecting FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries, changes in general economic conditions affecting FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries, interest rates and any actions taken by credit rating agencies that could negatively affect FirstEnergys and its subsidiaries access to financing or their costs and increase requirements to post additional collateral to support outstanding commodity positions, letters of credit and other financial guarantees, the continuing uncertainty of the national and regional economy and its impact on the major industrial and commercial customers of FirstEnergys subsidiaries, issues concerning the soundness of financial institutions and counterparties with which FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries do business, issues arising from the recently completed merger of FirstEnergy and Allegheny Energy, Inc. and the ongoing coordination of their combined operations including FirstEnergys ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers, as well as the ability to successfully integrate the businesses and realize cost savings and any other synergies and the risk that the credit ratings of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different from what the companies expect, the risks and other factors discussed from time to time in FirstEnergys and its applicable subsidiaries SEC filings, and other similar factors. The foregoing review of factors should not be construed as exhaustive. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor assess the impact of any such factor on FirstEnergys business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The Registrants expressly disclaim any current intention to update any forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
