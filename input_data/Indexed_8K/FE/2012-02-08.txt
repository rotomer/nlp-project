Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Impairment charges associated with the event reported in Item 2.05 below, aggregating approximately $87 million ($52 million after-tax) are expected to reduce FirstEnergy Corp.s earnings per basic share of common stock by $0.13 for the year ended December 31, 2011.  FirstEnergy has updated its estimate of earnings computed under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the year ended December 31, 2011, to be $2.31 to $2.33 per basic share of common stock.  FirstEnergys estimate of non-GAAP earnings per basic share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2011, remains unchanged from the information included on Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K filed by FirstEnergy Corp. on January 26, 2012.
 
 
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On February 7, 2012, officers of FirstEnergy Corp. and Monongahela Power Company, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary, committed to retiring the following fossil generating units by September 1, 2012:
 
 
The decision to retire these generating units was based on the new U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which were recently finalized, and other environmental regulations.  These closures are subject to review for reliability impacts by PJM Interconnection LLC, the regional transmission organization that controls the area where these power plants are located.  As a result of this decision, impairment charges associated with these assets will be recognized by FirstEnergy Corp. aggregating approximately $87 million ($52 million after-tax).
In total, 105 employees will be directly affected.  Existing severance benefits will apply to eligible, affected employees.  However, the final number of affected employees could be less as some are considered for open positions at other FirstEnergy facilities and work locations, and eligible employees take advantage of an additional benefit being offered to those 55 years and older.  Affected employees will be eligible for severance payments in 2012 that are currently estimated to be $5 million.  It is also estimated that additional costs to prepare the plants for closing of approximately $2 million will be incurred in 2012.
The generating units have other obligations that could be affected by the plant closings and are currently unable to reasonably estimate potential costs, or a range thereof, that could be incurred.  There are no other estimated future year cash impacts related to this decision other than the avoidance of additional capital expenditures to make these plants comply with the recently finalized environmental regulations.

Akron, Ohio  FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) announced today that its Monongahela Power Company (Mon Power) subsidiary will be retiring three older coal-fired power plants located in West Virginia by September 1, 2012.  The decision to close the plants is based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which were recently finalized, and other environmental regulations.
The following plants will be retired:  Albright Power Station, Willow Island Power Station, and Rivesville Power Station.  In total, 105 employees will be directly affected.
The total capacity of these regulated plants is 660 megawatts (MW), about
3 percent of FirstEnergys total regulated and competitive generation portfolio.  Recently, these plants served mostly as peaking facilities, generating, on average, less than 1 percent of the electricity produced by FirstEnergy over the past three years.
Mon Power recently completed a yearlong study of its older, unscrubbed regulated coal-fired units to determine the potential impact of significant changes in environmental regulations.  It was determined that additional investments to implement MATS and other environmental rules would make these plants even less likely to be dispatched.  As a result, the decision was made to retire these West Virginia plants rather than continue operations.
 
 
 
 
 
This follows FirstEnergys announcement last month that its competitive generation subsidiaries would retire six older, coal-fired power plants located in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland by September 1, 2012.
The high cost to implement MATS and other environmental rules is the reason these Mon Power plants are being retired, said James R. Haney, regional president of Mon Power and president of West Virginia Operations for FirstEnergy.
The number of affected employees could be less than 105 as some will be considered for open positions at other FirstEnergy facilities and work locations.  In addition, existing severance benefits will apply to eligible affected employees and certain employees may take advantage of an additional benefit being offered to those who are eligible for retirement.
All of the recently announced plant retirements are subject to review for reliability impacts, if any, by PJM Interconnection, the regional transmission organization that controls the area where they are located.
Since the Clean Air Act became law in 1970, FirstEnergy and its predecessor companies have invested more than $10 billion in environmental protection efforts.  Since 1990, FirstEnergy has reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides by more than
76 percent, sulfur dioxide by more than 86 percent and mercury by about 56 percent.  When the older coal-fired plants are retired and removed from FirstEnergys competitive and regulated generating fleet, nearly 100 percent of the power provided will come from resources that are non- or low-emitting, including nuclear, hydro, pumped-storage hydro, natural gas and scrubbed coal units.
FirstEnergy is a diversified energy company dedicated to safety, reliability and
operational excellence.  Its 10 electric distribution companies comprise the nations largest investor-owned electric system.  Its diverse generating fleet features non-emitting nuclear, scrubbed coal, natural gas, and pumped-storage hydro and other renewables, and has a total generating capacity of nearly 23,000 megawatts.
