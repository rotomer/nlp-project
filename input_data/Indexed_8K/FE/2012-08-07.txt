Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
August 7, 2012
, FirstEnergy Corp. issued two public documents regarding
second
quarter
2012
earnings, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference. FirstEnergy's Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community contain non-GAAP* financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community of the non-GAAP* financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The information in the Press Release and the Consolidated Report to the Financial Community and the information contained herein Items 2.02 and 9.01 shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall such information and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
The Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community contain references to non-GAAP* financial measures including, among others, basic non-GAAP earnings per share, which are not calculated in accordance with GAAP because they exclude the impact of "special items." Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are not routine or that may be related to discontinued businesses. Management believes presenting normalized earnings calculated in this manner provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of FirstEnergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing FirstEnergy's operating performance to the operating performance of other companies in the energy sector. Management believes presenting this non-GAAP* measure provides useful information to investors in assessing FirstEnergy's normalized operating performance. FirstEnergy's management frequently references this non-GAAP* financial measure in its decision-making, using it to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
The non-GAAP* information presented in the Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Also, the non-GAAP* financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
*This Form 8-K contains non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustment that has the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements:
This Form 8-K

These statements include declarations regarding management's intents, beliefs and current expectations. These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms "anticipate," "potential," "expect," "believe," "estimate" and similar words. Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially due to: the speed and nature of increased competition in the electric utility industry, the impact of the regulatory process on the pending matters before FERC and in the various states in which we do business including, but not limited to, matters related to rates, the status of the PATH project in light of the PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., (PJM) direction to suspend work on the project pending review of its planning process, its re-evaluation of the need for the project and the uncertainty of the timing and amounts of any related capital expenditures, the uncertainties of various cost recovery and cost allocation issues resulting from ATSI's realignment into PJM, economic or weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changes in markets for energy services, changing energy and commodity market prices and availability, financial derivative reforms that could increase our liquidity needs and collateral costs, the continued ability of FirstEnergy's regulated utilities to collect transition and other costs, operation and maintenance costs being higher than anticipated, other legislative and regulatory changes, and revised environmental requirements, including possible GHG emission, water intake and coal combustion residual regulations, the potential impacts of any laws, rules or regulations that ultimately replace CAIR, including CSAPR which was stayed by the courts on December 30, 2011, and the effects of the EPA's MATS rules, the uncertainty of the timing and amounts of the capital expenditures that may arise in connection with any litigation including NSR litigation or potential regulatory initiatives or rulemakings (including that such expenditures could result in our decision to shut down or idle certain generating units), the uncertainties associated with the company's plan to retire its older unscrubbed regulated and competitive fossil units, including the impact on vendor commitments the timing of, those deactivations as they relate to, among other things, the Reliability Must Run arrangements and the reliability of the transmission grid, adverse regulatory or legal decisions and outcomes with respect to our nuclear operations (including, but not limited to the revocation or non-renewal of necessary licenses, approvals or operating permits by the NRC including as a result of the incident at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant), issues that could result from the NRCs review of the indications of cracking in the Davis-Besse plant shield building, adverse legal decisions and outcomes related to Met-Ed's and Penelec's ability to recover certain transmission costs through their transmission service charge riders, the continuing availability of generating units, changes in their operational status and any related impacts on vendor commitments, replacement power costs being higher than anticipated or inadequately hedged, the ability to comply with applicable state and federal reliability standards and energy efficiency mandates, changes in customers' demand for power, including but not limited to, changes resulting from the implementation of state and federal energy efficiency mandates, the ability to accomplish or realize anticipated benefits from strategic goals, FirstEnergy's ability to improve electric commodity margins and the impact of, among other factors, the increased cost of fuel and fuel transportation on such margins, the ability to experience growth in the distribution business, the changing market conditions that could affect the measurement of liabilities and the value of assets held in FirstEnergy's NDTs, pension trusts and other trust funds, and cause FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries to make additional contributions sooner, or in amounts that are larger than currently anticipated, the impact of changes to material accounting policies, the ability to access the public securities and other capital and credit markets in accordance with FirstEnergy's financing plan, the cost of such capital and overall condition of the capital and credit markets affecting FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries, changes in general economic conditions affecting FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries, interest rates and any actions taken by credit rating agencies that could negatively affect FirstEnergy's and its subsidiaries' access to financing or their costs and increase requirements to post additional collateral to support outstanding commodity positions, LOCs and other financial guarantees, the state of the national and regional economy and its impact on major industrial and commercial customers of FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries, issues concerning the soundness of domestic and foreign financial institutions and counterparties with which FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries do business, the risks and other factors discussed from time to time in FirstEnergy's and its applicable subsidiaries' SEC filings, and other similar factors. Dividends declared from time to time on FirstEnergy's common stock during any annual period may in aggregate vary from the indicated amount due to circumstances considered by FirstEnergy's Board of Directors at the time of the actual declarations. The foregoing review of factors should not be construed as exhaustive. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor assess the impact of any such factor on FirstEnergys business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. FirstEnergy expressly disclaims any current intention to update, except as required by law, any forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

FirstEnergy Announces Second Quarter 2012 Earnings
Reaffirms 2012 Guidance
Akron, Ohio - FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today announced second quarter 2012 earnings of $0.60 per basic share of common stock ($0.59 diluted) on a non-GAAP* basis. These results exclude the impact of special items listed below. This compares to non-GAAP earnings of $0.70 per basic share ($0.69 diluted) in the second quarter of 2011.
On a GAAP basis, second quarter 2012 earnings were $0.45 per basic and diluted share of common stock on net income of $188 million and revenue of $3.9 billion. Second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were $0.48 per basic and diluted share on net income of $193 million, with revenue of $4.1 billion.
Today we are reaffirming our 2012 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $3.30 to $3.60 per share, said FirstEnergy President and Chief Executive Officer Anthony J. Alexander. Despite the continued challenges of the sluggish economy and the impact of mild weather on our first half results, we remain confident in our long-term strategies, and we will continue positioning our competitive business for the eventual economic recovery.
Second quarter 2012 non-GAAP results benefited from lower operating costs, lower gross receipts taxes and reduced interest expense. Results were negatively affected by lower sales margins from competitive operations, a reduction in investment income, and increased depreciation expense.

Total distribution deliveries increased slightly in the quarter, but the earnings impact was essentially flat. Industrial sales increased 3 percent, commercial deliveries rose modestly, and residential deliveries decreased slightly.
While FirstEnergy Solutions (FES) continues to successfully expand its business and customer base, commodity margin decreased compared to the second quarter of 2011 as a result of lower average power prices and sales to the wholesale market, higher purchased power costs, lower capacity revenues and a reduction in sales of Renewable Energy Credits. These factors were partially offset by reduced net transmission costs, and lower fuel expense.
For the first six months of 2012, net income was $494 million, or earnings of $1.18 per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $7.9 billion. This compares to first-half 2011 net income of $240 million, or earnings of $0.67 per basic and diluted share of common stock on revenue of $7.6 billion.

2.0 million
MWH, or

, and mass market sales increased by 794,000 MWH, or 254%.
Provider of Last Resort (POLR) generation sales decreased by 1.4 million MWH, or 25%, from a reduced number of tranches served and decreased MWHs per tranche. The decreased volume per tranche reflects the impact of a decline in residential customer usage and increased migration of customers away from the utilities' default service. The reduction in POLR sales is consistent with CES' strategy to realign its sales portfolio.

Financial Matters
Dividend
On July 17, 2012, the Board of Directors of FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy or FE) declared an unchanged quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of outstanding FE common stock. The dividend will be payable September 1, 2012, to shareholders of record as of August 7, 2012.
Financing Activities
    
In May 2012, FirstEnergy executed a total of $1.6 billion forward starting swaps expiring December 31, 2013, in order to manage interest rate risk associated with anticipated future long-term debt issuances, which includes refinancings.
On May 8, 2012, FET entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility. In conjunction with this action, an existing $450 million TrAIL revolving credit facility was terminated. Additionally, FirstEnergy and FirstEnergy Solutions/AE Supply amended their existing $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities, respectively. The termination date on both facilities was extended from June 2016 to May 2017 and pricing was reduced to reflect current market conditions.
On August 1, 2012, FirstEnergy Generation Corp. (FGCO) mandatorily repurchased approximately $106.5 million of 4.75% pollution control revenue bonds, which it is holding for future remarketing or refinancing subject to market and other conditions.
Operational Matters
Enhancing Transmission System Reliability
On May 29, 2012, FirstEnergy announced plans to construct a series of transmission projects to enhance service reliability across its service area. The projects have been approved by PJM and will include specialized voltage regulating equipment in northern Ohio. In addition to the work in Ohio, approved transmission projects will also be undertaken in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Jersey and Maryland as part of FirstEnergy's ongoing commitment to enhance its transmission system reliability. FirstEnergy estimates spending between $700 - $900 million through 2016 on these projects.
On June 14, 2012, Jersey Central Power & Light Company (JCP&L) announced that it plans to begin work on 17 transmission construction projects over the next six months in its northern and central New Jersey service areas. These projects are part of the multi-year, $200 million Local Infrastructure and Transmission Enhancement (LITE) program, which began in 2011, to address New Jersey's growing demand for electricity and provide key enhancements to the transmission system designed to improve service reliability for JCP&L's 1.1 million customers. All of the LITE projects are being designed and built specifically to serve only JCP&L customers.
Beaver Valley Unit 1 Returns to Service after Refueling Outage
On May 11, 2012, Beaver Valley Power Station Unit 1 returned to service following an April 9, 2012, shutdown for refueling and maintenance. During the outage, 65 of the 157 fuel assemblies were exchanged and safety inspections were successfully conducted. In addition, maintenance and improvement projects were completed which are designed to ensure continued safe and reliable operations. Prior to the outage, Beaver Valley Unit 1 operated safely and reliably for 359 consecutive days during which time it generated more than 9.3 million megawatt hours of electricity. The plant also posted

an industry top-decile forced-loss rate of 0.01 percent during the 18 months of operation prior to the outage.
Davis-Besse Returns to Service after Refueling Outage
On June 13, 2012, Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station returned to service following a May 6, 2012, shutdown for refueling and maintenance. During the outage, 68 of the 177 fuel assemblies were exchanged and safety inspections, including inspections of the station's steam generators, were conducted. Preventive maintenance and improvement projects also were completed that are designed to promote continued safe and reliable operations.
Impact of Recent Storm Costs
During the last weekend of June 2012, Monongahela Power Company (MP), The Potomac Edison Company (PE), West Penn Power Company and Ohio Edison Company (OE) experienced significant customer outages due to a rare derecho wind storm. While projections for restoration costs are not finalized, estimated costs related to this storm are expected to exceed $130 million.

MP and PE do not currently have regulatory authority to defer storm costs, but expect to make a filing in the third quarter of 2012 with the Public Service Commission of West Virginia requesting deferral of these costs.
