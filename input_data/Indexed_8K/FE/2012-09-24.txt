Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On September 18, 2012, the FirstEnergy Board of Directors (Board), upon recommendation of its Compensation Committee, approved Amendment No. 1 (Amendment) to the FirstEnergy Corp. Change In Control Severance Plan (CIC Severance Plan) effective January 1, 2014, after the expiration of the term of the current plan, to provide that any annual bonus award payable in the year of a plan participant's termination be paid on a prorated basis at target based on the number of days employed during the plan year. The Amendment also extended the term of the CIC Severance Plan for an additional year to December 31, 2014, which as provided for in the present plan, will automatically renew each year for an additional year unless the Board affirmatively votes not to extend the plan. FirstEnergy maintains the CIC Severance Plan to provide for the payment of severance benefits to certain eligible executives of FirstEnergy, including all actively employed named executive officers, in the event their employment with FirstEnergy terminates involuntarily in connection with a change in control of FirstEnergy.
Prior to this Amendment, the CIC Severance Plan had a term that ended December 31, 2013, and provided that any annual bonus award payable in the year of a plan participant's termination would be paid in full at target without proration. This Amendment providing for the prorated payment of the annual bonus award in the year of termination is designed to reflect current market practice.
