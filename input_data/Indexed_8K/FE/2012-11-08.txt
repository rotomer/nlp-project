Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
November 8, 2012
, FirstEnergy Corp. issued two public documents regarding
third
quarter
2012
earnings, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference. FirstEnergy's Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community contain non-GAAP* financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FirstEnergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community of the non-GAAP* financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The information in the Press Release and the Consolidated Report to the Financial Community and the information contained herein Items 2.02 and 9.01 shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall such information and Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
The Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community contain references to non-GAAP* financial measures including, among others, basic non-GAAP earnings per share, which are not calculated in accordance with GAAP because they exclude the impact of "special items." Special items reflect the impact on earnings of events that are not routine or that may be related to discontinued businesses. Management believes presenting normalized earnings calculated in this manner provides useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of FirstEnergy's businesses and assists investors in comparing FirstEnergy's operating performance to the operating performance of other companies in the energy sector. Management believes presenting this non-GAAP* measure provides useful information to investors in assessing FirstEnergy's normalized operating performance. FirstEnergy's management frequently references this non-GAAP* financial measure in its decision-making, using it to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons as well as comparisons to the performance of peer companies.
The non-GAAP* information presented in the Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Also, the non-GAAP* financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
*This Form 8-K contains non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustment that has the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements:
This 8-K includes forward-looking statements based on information currently available to management. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These statements include declarations regarding management's intents, beliefs and current expectations. These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms
anticipate,
potential,
expect,
believe,
estimate
and similar words. Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially due to: the speed and nature of increased competition in the electric utility industry, the impact of the regulatory process on the pending matters before FERC and in the various states in which we do business including, but not limited to, matters related to rates, the uncertainties of various cost recovery and cost allocation issues resulting from ATSI's realignment into PJM, economic or weather conditions affecting future sales and margins, changing energy, capacity and commodity market prices and availability, financial derivative reforms that could increase our liquidity needs and collateral costs, the continued ability of our regulated utilities to collect transition and other costs, operation and maintenance costs being higher than anticipated, other legislative and regulatory changes, and revised environmental requirements, including possible GHG emission, water intake and coal combustion residual regulations, the potential impacts of CAIR, and any laws, rules or regulations that ultimately replace CAIR, and the effects of the EPA's MATS rules, the uncertainty of the timing and amounts of the capital expenditures that may arise in connection with any litigation, including NSR litigation or potential regulatory initiatives or rulemakings (including that such expenditures could result in our decision to deactivate or idle certain generating units), the uncertainties associated with our plans to deactivate our older unscrubbed regulated and competitive fossil units and our plans to change the operations of certain fossil plants, including the impact on vendor commitments, and the timing of those deactivations and operational changes as they relate to, among other things, the RMR arrangements and the reliability of the transmission grid, issues that could result from the NRC's review of the indications of cracking in the Davis Besse Plant shield building, adverse regulatory or legal decisions and outcomes with respect to our nuclear operations (including, but not limited to the revocation or non-renewal of necessary licenses, approvals or operating permits by the NRC or as a result of the incident at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant), adverse legal decisions and outcomes related to ME's and PN's ability to recover certain transmission costs through their transmission service charge riders, the continuing availability of generating units, changes in their operational status and any related impacts on vendor commitments, replacement power costs being higher than anticipated or inadequately hedged, the ability to comply with applicable state and federal reliability standards and energy efficiency mandates, changes in customers' demand for power, including but not limited to, changes resulting from the implementation of state and federal energy efficiency mandates, the ability to accomplish or realize anticipated benefits from strategic goals, our ability to improve electric commodity margins and the impact of, among other factors, the increased cost of fuel and fuel transportation on such margins, the ability to experience growth in the Regulated Distribution and Competitive Energy Services segments, changing market conditions that could affect the measurement of liabilities and the value of assets held in our NDTs, pension trusts and other trust funds, and cause us and our subsidiaries to make additional contributions sooner, or in amounts that are larger than currently anticipated, the impact of changes to material accounting policies, the ability to access the public securities and other capital and credit markets in accordance with our financing plans, the cost of such capital and overall condition of the capital and credit markets affecting us and our subsidiaries, changes in general economic conditions affecting us and our subsidiaries, interest rates and any actions taken by credit rating agencies that could negatively affect us and our subsidiaries' access to financing, increased costs thereof, and increase requirements to post additional collateral to support outstanding commodity positions, LOCs and other financial guarantees, the state of the national and regional economy and its impact on our major industrial and commercial customers, issues concerning the soundness of domestic and foreign financial institutions and counterparties with which we do business, the risks and other factors discussed from time to time in our SEC filings, and other similar factors. Dividends declared from time to time on FE's common stock during any annual period may in the aggregate vary from the indicated amount due to circumstances considered by FE's Board of Directors at the time of the actual declarations. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The foregoing review of factors should not be construed as exhaustive. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor assess the impact of any such factor on FirstEnergy's business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The registrant expressly disclaims any current intention to update, except as required by law, any forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

FirstEnergy Announces
Third
Quarter
2012
Earnings
Provides Guidance for 2013 and Remainder of 2012
Akron, Ohio - FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today announced
third
quarter
2012
earnings of $1.11 per basic and diluted share of common stock on a non-GAAP* basis. These results exclude the impact of special items listed below. This compares to non-GAAP earnings of $1.39 per basic and diluted share in the
third
quarter of
2011
.
On a GAAP basis,
third
quarter
2012
earnings were $1.02 per basic share of common stock ($1.01 diluted) on net income of
$425 million
and revenue of
$4.3 billion
.
Third
quarter
2011
GAAP earnings were $1.27 per basic and diluted share on net income of
$530 million
, with revenue of
$4.7 billion
.
The company also announced that it is narrowing 2012 non-GAAP earnings guidance to $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is the lower end of the previous range of $3.30 to $3.60 per share. The company also provided 2013 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $2.85 to $3.15 per share.
We continue to be very pleased with the progress of our retail strategy and we remain confident that FirstEnergy will be well-positioned for growth when the economy eventually recovers, said FirstEnergy President and Chief Executive Officer Anthony J. Alexander. We are taking a number of actions to manage our expenses and ensure that we are operating as cost-effectively as possible in light of the continued weak sales environment and low market prices for power.
Third quarter 2012 non-GAAP results benefited from a reduction in operating costs, interest expense and depreciation expense, as well as lower gross receipts taxes. Results were negatively affected by reduced sales margins from competitive operations, lower distribution deliveries, and a higher effective income tax rate.
Total distribution deliveries decreased 4 percent in the quarter. Residential deliveries declined by 4 percent, primarily due to milder weather compared to the third quarter of 2011. Commercial deliveries decreased 3 percent, while industrial deliveries decreased 5 percent.
While FirstEnergy Solutions (FES) continues to successfully expand its business and customer base, commodity margin decreased compared to the third quarter of 2011 due to the absence of a third quarter 2011 benefit related to fuel contract restructuring and the impact of lower capacity prices. These factors offset higher contract sales volumes.
For the first nine months of 2012, net income was $919 million, or earnings of $2.20 per basic share of common stock ($2.19 diluted), on revenue of $12.3 billion. This compares to net income of $770 million, or earnings of $2.01 per basic share of common stock ($2.00 diluted) on revenue of $12.4 billion in the first nine months of 2011.

(b) Wholesale Sales
- Wholesale electricity sales
decrease
d 227,000 MWH, or
3%
. The combination of lower average prices and lower sales volume in the third quarter of 2012 decreased earnings by
$0.08
per share.**
(c) Fuel Expenses
- Excluding the absence of a fuel contract that was restructured in the third quarter of 2011 (see item j below), ongoing fuel expenses increased earnings by
$0.24
per share.** Generation output decreased 3.4 million MWH, or 12%. Fossil supercritical and subcritical generation output decreased by 2.7 million MWH and 472,000 MWH, respectively. The reduction in fossil generation output was the result of recently deactivated units, or those planned to be deactivated, the decision to change operations at the Sammis Plant beginning in August 2012, and an increase in economic purchases. Nuclear generation output decreased 243,000 MWH.
(d) Purchased Power
- Economic power purchases increased by 6.1 million MWH, or 169%, primarily due to lower generation output as discussed above, and increased retail generation sales. The increase in purchased power costs decreased earnings by
$0.40
per share.**
(e
) Capacity Expenses
- Lower capacity prices more than offset CES' increased retail sales obligations, increasing earnings by
$0.16
per share.
(f) Net MISO-PJM Transmission Expenses
- Lower transmission expenses, primarily due to lower congestion, increased earnings by
$0.04
per share.
(g) Net Financial Sales and Purchases
- Net financial hedges, associated with FES' sales and generation portfolio, increased earnings by $0.03 per share.
(h) Renewable Energy Credit (REC) Sales
- Fewer REC sales decreased earnings by
$0.01
per share.
(i) PJM Capacity - Base Residual (BR) and Fixed Resource Requirement (FRR) Auctions
- Lower capacity revenues decreased earnings by
$0.22
per share, primarily as a result of lower capacity prices.
(j) Fuel Contract Restructuring
- The absence in 2012 of a gain from a fuel contract that was restructured in the third quarter of 2011 decreased earnings by $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2012 (see item c above).
**The following revenues and expenses associated with coal plants recently deactivated and RMR units through August 31, 2012 have been removed from each category above and are included as Special Items (see page 5): wholesale revenues, fuel expenses, wholesale revenues that are netted on an hourly basis against purchased power, O&M expenses and property taxes.

(a)
Lower Regulated Distribution expenses, net of storm deferrals, increased earnings by $0.07 per share, primarily due to more work allocated to capital, including adjustments associated with integrating Allegheny's work management systems with FirstEnergy's earlier this year that were expensed in prior periods, and lower storm costs in all service territories.
Restoration costs associated with the Derecho storm, primarily impacting West Virginia and Pennsylvania, amounted to $144 million. A total of $37 million was related to O&M activities, of which $33 million was deferred for future recovery from customers.
(b)
Lower O&M expenses associated with ongoing fossil operations increased earnings by $0.03 per share.**
**The following revenues and expenses associated with coal plants recently deactivated and RMR units through August 31, 2012 have been removed from each category above and are included as Special Items (see page 5): wholesale revenues, fuel expenses, wholesale revenues that are netted on an hourly basis

In August 2012, FGC changed the operating status of the 2,220 MW coal-fired W. H. Sammis power plant to cold-storage. The decision was made to reduce operating costs in the face of a continued weak economy and historically low market prices for electricity. The plant will remain available for reliability purposes when called on by PJM.
As announced earlier this year, units at seven coal-fired power plants (Albright, Armstrong, Bay Shore Units 2-4, Eastlake Units 4-5, R. Paul Smith Units 3-4, Rivesville, and Willow Island) were deactivated as of September 1, 2012. Units at three coal-fired power plants (Ashtabula Unit 5, Eastlake Units 1-3, and Lake Shore Unit 18) will continue to operate pursuant to Reliability Must Run arrangements with PJM.
Beaver Valley Power Station to Expand Fuel Storage Capacity
On September 17, 2012, FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) announced a plan to expand used nuclear fuel storage capacity at the Beaver Valley Power Station in Shippingport, Pa.  Under the plan, above-ground, airtight steel and concrete canisters will be installed to provide cooling, through natural air circulation, to used fuel assemblies. Construction of the fuel storage system will begin in fall 2012 with completion planned for 2014.  Certain costs incurred for this project are expected to be reimbursable by the U.S. Department of Energy under a January 2012 settlement.

FirstEnergy Announces Workforce Reductions
On September 19, 2012, FirstEnergy announced that it is conducting an organizational study to determine how its workforce should be aligned to best meet the challenges of the continued weak economy.  The initiative included a review of corporate support departments and FES.  The results of the study were announced on November 1, 2012, with reductions of approximately 200 staff positions. In addition, the company also expects further workforce reductions of approximately 300-400 occurring throughout 2013 as replacement of employees who leave the company through normal attrition will be limited. FirstEnergy expects to incur approximately $10 million of severance related expenses in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Beaver Valley Unit 2 Refueling Outage
On September 24, 2012, Beaver Valley Power Station Unit 2 safely shut down for refueling, maintenance, and a turbine upgrade expected to improve efficiency and reliability. The 904 MW unit operated safely and reliably for 532 consecutive days and generated more than 12 million megawatt hours of electricity since the completion of its last refueling in April 2011. On November 2, 2012, the plant successfully and safely completed the outage.
Impact of Hurricane Sandy
Hurricane Sandy affected 2.3 million FE customers in NJ, PA, OH, MD, and WV. More than 19,000 employees, outside utility crews and contractors participated in storm restoration efforts. Approximately 93% of customers affected have been restored as of November 8, 2012. In our Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L) and Monongahela Power territories, restoration work continues in the hardest-hit areas. Storm costs are expected to exceed $500 million, of which approximately 95% is expected to be capitalized or deferred for future recovery from customers. Final storm costs will be determined during the fourth quarter of 2012.
Regulatory Matters
JCP&L Rate Case Filing
On July 31, 2012 the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities ordered JCP&L to file a base rate case using a historic 2011 test year on or before November 1, 2012. However, due to Hurricane Sandy JCP&L requested an extension and will file by December 1, 2012.
Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Vacated
On August 21, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) CSAPR and directed the EPA to continue administering the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which CSAPR was meant to replace. CSAPR would have accelerated emission reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) and nitrogen oxide (NO
X
) from power plants.
PJM Removes Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline (PATH) Project from Expansion Plans
On August 24, 2012, PJM removed the PATH project from its long-range expansion plans. Citing a slow economy for reducing the projected growth in electricity use, PJM said its updated analysis no longer indicates a need for the $2.1 billion, 275-mile transmission line to maintain grid stability. Initially a joint venture between Allegheny Energy and American Electric Power, the project was suspended by PJM in February 2011. PATH expects to recover approximately $121 million in costs over the next 5 years, of which $62 million relates to PATH Allegheny and approximately $59 million relates to PATH-WV.

Ohio Companies' Alternative Energy Rider
On September 20, 2011, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) opened a new docket to review the alternative energy rider for OE, The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, and The Toledo Edison Company (Ohio Companies). The PUCO selected auditors to perform a financial and management audit, and final reports were filed with the PUCO on August 15, 2012. While generally supportive of the Ohio Companies' approach to procurement of renewable energy credits, the management/performance auditor recommended that the PUCO examine for possible disallowance, certain costs associated with the procurement of In-State All Renewable obligations. The PUCO set this matter for hearing on February 19, 2013.
PUCO Approves Ohio Securitization
On October 10, 2012, the PUCO approved the application of the Ohio Companies for a financing order to securitize previously incurred costs that are currently being recovered from customers under certain PUCO-approved deferred recovery riders. As filed in the application, those riders were estimated at $436 million as of December 31, 2012. The Ohio Companies expect to file an application for rehearing on November 9, 2012, to obtain certain clarifications and changes to the PUCO order necessary to complete the transaction.
