Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the first quarter of fiscal 2005, F5 Networks announced revenue of $60.0 million, a 20 percent increase over revenue of $50.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and a 66 percent increase over revenue of $36.1 million in the first quarter a year ago. The company's operating margin for the quarter was 24 percent, compared to 20 percent in the prior quarter and 11 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 19, 2005
Net income for first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $10.0 million ($0.26 per diluted share).
During the fourth quarter of 2004, F5 became subject to income taxes on U.S. income and also reversed the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets, resulting in net income of $15.8 million ($0.43 per diluted share), which included a net tax benefit of $5.5 million. To present prior results on a tax-affected basis that is comparable to the current period, the company's financial statements include pro forma earnings for the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004. On a pro forma basis, excluding the net tax benefit resulting from the reversal of the valuation allowance and including a 37 percent provision for income taxes, net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 would have been $6.8 million ($0.18 per diluted share).
In the first quarter of fiscal 2004 the company reported net income of $3.8 million ($0.11 per diluted share). On a pro forma basis, net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 would have been $2.6 million ($0.08 per diluted share) had the company recorded a 37 percent provision for income taxes.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's strong revenue growth was driven by continuing strength in its core traffic management business across all geographic regions. In addition, McAdam said he believes the recent introduction of the company's new products (the BIG-IP 6400, 3400 and 1500 running version 9 of the BIG-IP software), will expand its growth opportunities by enabling customers to secure, optimize and deliver their applications in ways that go

beyond traditional definitions of application traffic management. Leveraging the full-proxy architecture of the company's new Traffic Management Operating System (TM/OS), BIG-IP's advanced functionality includes delivery and optimization features such as IPv6 translation, universal persistence, error response handling, connection pooling, intelligent compression, L7 rate shaping and TCP optimization, as well as a number of security features, including cookie encryption, resource cloaking, advanced client authentication and selective content encryption.
During the first full quarter of shipment, McAdam said demand for the Version 9 BIG-IP products was strong, with sales of the new platforms accounting for 30 percent of application traffic management revenue.
In addition to continued improvement in profitability, McAdam said, the company's strong revenue growth and leveraged business model enabled it to further strengthen its financial position. During the quarter, collections resulting in 42 days sales outstanding (DSO) contributed to a record $13.5 million in cash from operations and total cash and investments of $254 million at quarter end.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2005, McAdam said management believes the company will continue to grow sequentially and has set a target range of $63.0 million to $65.0 million in revenue with net income of $0.28 to $0.29 per diluted share.
