Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 24, 2005, the shareholders of F5 Networks, Inc. (the "Company"), upon recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors, approved the F5 Networks, Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2005 Equity Incentive Plan").
Description of the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan
A maximum of 1,700,000 shares of the Company's common stock is available for issuance under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of any stock split, stock dividend, merger, combination of shares or similar change to capital structure of the Company. No more than 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be issued during any fiscal year under stock awards to employees of the Company or its affiliates.
The 2005 Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of nonstatutory stock options and stock units. The 2005 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Board of Directors of the Company unless the Board delegates administration to the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Employees, directors and consultants of the Company are eligible to receive stock awards under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan.
A more detailed summary of the material features of the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan is set forth in the Company's proxy statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 7, 2005. The summary in the proxy statement and the description of the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, which is included as part of the proxy statement and filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
Awards under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan
On February 24, 2005, each of the non-employee directors was granted options to purchase 7,500 shares of the Company's common stock (subject to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, merger, combination of shares or similar change to capital structure of the Company) under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. Directors receiving option grants were A. Gary Ames, Keith D. Grinstein, Karl D. Guelich, Alan Higginson and Rich Malone. Subject to the director's continuing service with the Company throughout such period, the options vest as to 100% of the shares on the first anniversary of the grant date except that in the event of a change in control of the Company, the vesting of 100% of the shares subject to the options will accelerate immediately prior to the change of control. Each option has an exercise price equal to $53.73 per share of common stock (the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant). The term of each option is ten years from the grant date.

The purpose of the Plan is to provide a means by which eligible recipients of Stock Awards may be given an opportunity to benefit from increases in value of the Common Stock through the granting of the following Stock Awards: (i) Options and (ii) Stock Units.

For example, a change in status from an Employee of the Company to a Consultant of an Affiliate or a Director of the Company will not constitute an interruption of Continuous Service.

ADMINISTRATION. (a) ADMINISTRATION BY BOARD. The Board shall administer the Plan unless and until the Board delegates administration to a Committee or an administrator, as provided in subsection 3(c). (b) POWERS OF BOARD. The Board shall have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan: (i) To determine from time to time which of the persons eligible under the Plan shall be granted Stock Awards; when and how each Stock Award shall be granted; what type or combination of types of Stock Awards shall be granted; the provisions, terms and conditions of each Stock Award granted (which need not be identical as among Participants or as among types of Stock Awards), including, without limitation: the time or times when a person shall be permitted to receive Shares pursuant to a Stock Award, the number of Shares with respect to which a Stock Award shall be granted to each such person, the exercise or purchase price (if any) of a Stock Award, the time or times when Stock Awards may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, any pro rata adjustment to vesting as a result of a Participant's transitioning from full- to part-time service (or vice versa), and any other restriction (including forfeiture restriction), limitation or term of any Stock Award, based in each case on such factors as the Board, in its sole discretion, shall determine; provided, however, that such provisions, terms and conditions are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. (ii) In order to fulfill the purposes of the Plan and without amending the Plan, to modify grants of Stock Awards to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside of the United States in order to recognize differences in local law, tax policies or customs. (iii) To construe and interpret the Plan and Stock Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration. The Board, in the 4
exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award Agreement, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan fully effective. (iv) To amend the Plan or a Stock Award as provided in Section 12. (v) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best interests of the Company which are not in conflict with the provisions of the Plan. (c) DELEGATION TO COMMITTEE. The Board may delegate administration of the Plan to a Committee or Committees of one or more members of the Board, and the term "Committee" shall apply to any person or persons to whom such authority has been delegated. In the discretion of the Board, the Committee may consist solely of two or more Outside Directors, in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, and/or solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors, in accordance with Rule 16b-3, and/or solely of two or more Independent Directors under applicable Nasdaq (or other exchange) rules. The Board or the Committee may further delegate its authority and responsibilities under the Plan to an Officer. However, if administration is delegated to an Officer, such Officer may grant Stock Awards only within guidelines established by the Board or the Committee, and only the Board or the Committee may make a Stock Award to an Officer or Director. If administration is delegated to a Committee, the Committee shall have, in connection with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board, including the power to delegate to a subcommittee any of the administrative powers the Committee is authorized to exercise (and references in this Plan to the Board shall thereafter be to the Committee or subcommittee, or an Officer to whom authority has been delegated), subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by the Board. The Board may abolish the Committee at any time and revest in the Board the administration of the Plan, and unless otherwise specified by the Board shall retain any authority granted to a committee or individual hereunder unto itself. 4. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN. (a) SHARE RESERVE. Subject to the provisions of Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, the stock that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards shall not exceed in the aggregate One Million Seven Hundred Thousand (1,700,000) Shares of Common Stock. (b) SECTION 162(m) LIMITATION ON SHARE NUMBERS. No Employee shall be eligible to be granted Stock Awards covering more than One Million (1,000,000) Shares during any fiscal year of the Company. (c) REVERSION OF SHARES TO THE SHARE RESERVE. If any Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise terminate, in whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, the Shares not acquired under such Stock Award shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. Further, if any previously-issued Shares are forfeited under the terms and conditions of the Stock Award, then any Shares so forfeited shall revert to and again become 5
available for issuance under the Plan. The provisions of this Section 4(c) are qualified by Section 4(a) such that the total number of Shares issued and outstanding under the Plan at any time may not exceed the number set forth in Section 4(a) (as adjusted under Section 11). (d) SOURCE OF SHARES. The stock subject to the Plan may be unissued Shares or reacquired Shares, bought on the market or otherwise. 5. ELIGIBILITY. Stock Awards may be granted to Employees, Directors and Consultants. 6. OPTION PROVISIONS. Each Option shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical, but each Option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions: (a) TERM. No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it was granted. (b) EXERCISE PRICE OF AN OPTION. The exercise price of each Option shall be at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may be granted with an exercise price lower than that set forth in the preceding sentence if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner satisfying the provisions of Section 424(a) of the Code. (c) CONSIDERATION. The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either (i) in cash, check or wire transfer at the time the Option is exercised or (ii) at the discretion of the Board at the time of the grant of the Option or subsequently by (1) by delivery to the Company of other Shares that have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option is exercised, provided that in the case of Shares acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company, such Shares must have been owned by the Partcipant for more than six (6) months on the date of surrender (or such other period as may be required to avoid the Company's incurring an adverse accounting charge), (2) if, as of the date of exercise of an Option the Company then is permitting Employees to engage in a "same-day sale" cashless brokered exercise program involving one or more brokers, through such a program that complies with the Applicable Laws (including without limitation the requirements of Regulation T and other applicable regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board) and that ensures prompt delivery to the Company of the amount required to pay the exercise price and any applicable withholding taxes, (3) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board, or (4) any combination of the foregoing methods. In making its determination as to the type of consideration to accept, the Board shall consider if acceptance of such consideration may be reasonably expected to benefit the Company and the Board may, in its sole discretion, refuse to accept a particular form of consideration at the time of any Option exercise. 6
(d) TRANSFERABILITY OF AN OPTION. The Option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 6(d), the Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option. (e) VESTING. (i) GENERALLY. The total number of Shares of Common Stock subject to an Option may, but need not, vest and therefore become exercisable in periodic installments which may, but need not, be equal. The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may be exercised (which may be based on performance or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate. The vesting provisions of individual Options may vary. The provisions of this subsection 6(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of Shares as to which an Option may be exercised. (ii) LEAVE OF ABSENCE. The Board (or any other party to whom such authority has been delegated, including under this Plan) shall have the discretion to determine whether and to what extent the vesting of Options shall be tolled during any unpaid leave of absence; provided, however, that in the absence of such determination, vesting of Options shall be tolled during any such unpaid leave (unless otherwise required by the Applicable Laws). In the event of military leave, vesting shall toll during any unpaid portion of such leave, provided that, upon a Participant's returning from military leave (under conditions that would entitle him or her to protection upon such return under the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act), he or she shall be given vesting credit with respect to Options to the same extent as would have applied had the Participant continued to provide services to the Company throughout the leave on the same terms as he or she was providing services immediately prior to such leave. (f) TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS SERVICE. In the event a Participant's Continuous Service terminates (other than upon the Participant's death or Disability), the Participant may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Participant was vested in the Option Shares and entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date three (3) months following the termination of the Participant's Continuous Service (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement), or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified in the Option Agreement, the Option shall terminate. (g) EXTENSION OF TERMINATION DATE. Following the termination of the Participant's Continuous Service (other than upon the Participant's death or Disability), if the Participant would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of Shares would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act or violate any prohibition on trading on the basis of possession of material nonpublic information involving the Company and its business, 7
then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the term of the Option set forth in subsection 6(a), or (ii) the expiration of a period of three (3) months after the termination of the Participant's Continuous Service during which the exercise of the Option would not be in violation of such requirements. (h) DISABILITY OF PARTICIPANT. In the event a Participant's Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Participant was vested in the Option Shares and entitled to exercise the Option as of the date of termination), but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following such termination (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement) or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. (i) DEATH OF PARTICIPANT. In the event (i) an Participant's Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant's death or (ii) the Participant dies within the period (if any) specified in the Option Agreement after the termination of the Participant's Continuous Service for a reason other than death, then the Option may be exercised (to the extent the Participant was vested in the Option Shares and entitled to exercise the Option as of the date of death) by the Participant's estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option upon the Participant's death pursuant to subsection 6(d), but only within the period ending on the earlier of (1) the date eighteen (18) months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period specified in the Option Agreement) or (2) the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, after death, the Option is not exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. (j) EXERCISE GENERALLY. Options shall be considered exercised when the Company (or its authorized agent) receives (i) written or electronic notice from the person entitled to exercise the Option of intent to exercise a specific number of Shares, (ii) full payment or appropriate provision for payment in a form and method acceptable to the Board or Committee, for the Shares being exercised, and (iii) if applicable, payment or appropriate provision for payment of any withholding taxes due on exercise. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. The Option may, at the discretion of the Board or Committee, include a provision whereby the Participant may elect to exercise the Option as to Shares that are not yet vested. Unvested Shares exercised in such manner may be subject to a Company repurchase right under Section 10(f) or such other restrictions or conditions as the Board or Committee may determine. (k) ADMINISTRATOR DISCRETION. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, the Board or the Committee shall have complete discretion exercisable at any time to (i) extend the period of time for which an Option is to remain exercisable, following the Participant's termination of Continuous Service, but in no event beyond the expiration date for the Option, and (ii) permit the Option to be exercised, during the applicable post-termination exercise period, not 8
only with respect to the number of Shares that were vested on the date of termination, cut also with respect to additional Shares on such terms and conditions as the Board or Committee may determine. 7. PROVISIONS OF STOCK AWARDS OTHER THAN OPTIONS. Each Stock Award Agreement reflecting the issuance of a Stock Unit shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of such agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate agreements need not be identical, but each such agreement shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions: (a) CONSIDERATION. A Stock Unit may be awarded in consideration for such property or services as is permitted under Applicable Law, including for past services actually rendered to the Company or an Affiliate for its benefit. (b) VESTING; RESTRICTIONS. Shares of Common Stock awarded under the agreement reflecting a Stock Unit award may, but need not, be subject to a Share repurchase option, forfeiture restriction or other conditions in favor of the Company in accordance with a vesting or lapse schedule to be determined by the Board. (c) TERMINATION OF PARTICIPANT'S CONTINUOUS SERVICE. In the event a Participant's Continuous Service terminates, the Company may reacquire any or all of the Shares of Common Stock held by the Participant which have not vested or which are otherwise subject to forfeiture or other conditions as of the date of termination under the terms of the agreement. (d) TRANSFERABILITY. Rights to acquire Shares of Common Stock under a Stock Unit agreement shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and Shares of Common Stock issued upon vesting of a Stock Unit shall be issuable during the lifetime of the Participant only to the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 7(d), the Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, shall thereafter be entitled to receive Shares of Common Stock issued upon vesting of a Stock Unit. 8. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. (a) AVAILABILITY OF SHARES. During the terms of the Stock Awards, the Company shall keep available at all times the number of Shares of Common Stock required to satisfy such Stock Awards. (b) SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE. The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to grant Stock Awards and to issue and sell Shares upon exercise of the Stock Awards; 9
provided, however, that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act the Plan, any Stock Award or any stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. 9. USE OF PROCEEDS FROM STOCK; UNFUNDED PLAN. Proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to Stock Awards shall constitute general funds of the Company. The Plan shall be unfunded. Although bookkeeping accounts may be established with respect to Participants who are granted Stock Awards hereunder, any such accounts will be used merely as a bookkeeping convenience. The Company shall not be required to segregate any asset which may at any time be represented by Stock Awards, nor shall this Plan be construed as providing for such segregation, nor shall the Company nor any party authorized to administer the Plan be deemed to be a trustee of stock or cash to be awarded under the Plan. Any liability of the Company to any Participant with respect to a Stock Award shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations which may be created by the Plan; no such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge or other encumbrance on any property of the Company. Neither the Company nor any party authorized to administer the Plan shall be required to give any security or bond for the performance of any obligation which may be created by this Plan. 10. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) ACCELERATION OF EXERCISABILITY AND VESTING. The Board shall have the power to accelerate the time at which a Stock Award may first be exercised or the time during which a Stock Award or any part thereof will vest, become exercisable or be settled in accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Stock Award stating the time at which it may first vest, be exercised or be settled. (b) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS. No Participant shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any Shares subject to such Stock Award unless and until such Participant has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Stock Award pursuant to its terms. (c) NO EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER SERVICE RIGHTS. Nothing in the Plan or any instrument executed or any Stock Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer upon any Participant or other holder of Stock Awards any right to continue to serve the Company or an Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Stock Award was granted or shall affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (i) the employment of an Employee with or without notice and with or without cause, (ii) the service of a Consultant pursuant to the terms of such Consultant's agreement with the Company or an Affiliate or (iii) the service of a Director pursuant to the 10
Bylaws of the Company or an Affiliate, and any applicable provisions of the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be. (d) INVESTMENT ASSURANCES. The Company may require a Participant, as a condition of exercising or acquiring Shares under any Stock Award, (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to the Participant's knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Stock Award; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that the Participant is acquiring the stock subject to the Stock Award for the Participant's own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if (iii) the issuance of the Shares upon the exercise or acquisition of stock under the Stock Award has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (iv) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws. The Company may, upon advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the stock. (e) WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS. To the extent provided by the terms of a Stock Award Agreement, the Participant may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise or acquisition of Shares under a Stock Award by any of the following means (in addition to the Company's right to withhold from any compensation paid to the Participant by the Company) or by a combination of such means: (i) tendering a cash payment; (ii) authorizing the Company to withhold Shares from the Shares otherwise issuable to the Participant as a result of the exercise or acquisition of stock under the Stock Award; or (iii) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered Shares. (f) REPURCHASE LIMITATION. The terms of any repurchase option shall be specified in the Stock Award and may be at Fair Market Value at the time of repurchase, at the original purchase price or on such other terms and conditions as the Board may determine (and as shall be reflected in the Stock Award Agreement). 11
(g) CANCELLATION AND RE-GRANT OF OPTIONS. The Company may not reprice any outstanding Stock Awards under the Plan, including implement any program whereby outstanding Stock Awards will be cancelled and replaced with Stock Awards bearing a lower purchase or exercise price, without first obtaining the approval of the shareholders of the Company; provided however that this Section 10(g) shall in no way limit the Company's ability to adjust Stock Awards as provided under Section 11 below. (h) INTERPRETATION OF PLAN AND STOCK AWARDS. In the event that any provision of the Plan or any Stock Award granted under the Plan is declared to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be reformed, if possible, to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, or otherwise deleted, and the remainder of the terms of the Plan and/or Stock Award shall not be affected to the extent necessary to reform or delete such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision. All questions arising under the Plan or under any Stock Award shall be decided by the Board or the Committee in its or their total and absolute discretion and such decisions shall be final and binding on all parties. (i) ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. Any document required to be delivered under the Plan, including under the Applicable Laws, may be delivered in writing or electronically.

To enforce any restriction applicable to Shares issued under the Plan, the Board or the Committee may require a Participant or other holder of such Shares to deposit the certificates representing such Shares, with approved stock powers or other transfer instruments endorsed in blank, with the Company or an agent of the Company until the restrictions have lapsed. Such certificates (or other notations representing the Shares) may bear a legend or legends referencing the applicable restrictions. 11. ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN STOCK. (a) CAPITALIZATION ADJUSTMENTS. If any change is made in the stock subject to the Plan, or subject to any Stock Award, without the receipt of consideration by the Company (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company), the Plan will be appropriately adjusted in the class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to subsection 4(a) and the maximum number of securities subject to award to any person pursuant to subsection 4(b), and the outstanding Stock Awards will be appropriately adjusted in the class(es) and number of securities and price per Share of stock subject to such outstanding Stock Awards. The Board, the determination of which shall be final, binding and conclusive, shall make such adjustments. (The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as a transaction "without receipt of consideration" by the Company.) 12

(i) In the event of (1) a sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (2) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or (3) a reverse merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation but the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash or otherwise, or (4) the direct or indirect acquisition (including by way of a tender or exchange offer) by any person, or persons acting as a group, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, then any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation shall assume any Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan or shall substitute similar awards (including with respect to a Stock Award an award to acquire the same consideration paid to the shareholders in the transaction described in this subsection 11(c) for those outstanding under the Plan). (ii) For purposes of subsection 11(c) a Stock Award shall be deemed assumed if, following the change in control, the Stock Award confers the right to purchase in accordance with its terms and conditions, for each share of Common Stock subject to the Stock Award immediately prior to the change in control, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other securities or property) to which a holder of a share of Common Stock on the effective date of the change in control was entitled. (iii) Subject to the provisions of any Stock Award Agreement, in the event any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation refuses to assume such Stock Awards or to substitute similar stock awards for those outstanding under the Plan, then with respect to Stock Awards held by Participants whose Continuous Service has not terminated, the vesting of 50% of such Stock Awards (and, if applicable, the time during which such Stock Awards may be exercised or settled) shall be accelerated in full, and the Stock Awards shall terminate if not exercised or settled (if applicable) at or prior to such event. With respect to any other Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan, such Stock Awards shall terminate if not exercised (if applicable) prior to such event. (iv) The Board shall at all times have the authority, in its sole discretion, to provide for additional or different vesting, exercisability, settlement or forfeiture conditions with respect to Stock Awards than that reflected in this Section 11(c), provided that its determinations in this regard shall be reflected in the Stock Award Agreement (including in amendments thereto) issued to the affected Participant. 13
12. AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN AND STOCK AWARDS. (a) AMENDMENT OF PLAN. The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the Plan. However, except as provided in Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the shareholders of the Company to the extent shareholder approval is necessary to satisfy the requirements of Rule 16b-3 or any Nasdaq or securities exchange listing requirements. (b) SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. The Board may, in its sole discretion, submit any other amendment to the Plan for shareholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder regarding the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to certain executive officers. (c) CONTEMPLATED AMENDMENTS. It is expressly contemplated that the Board may amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable to provide eligible Employees with the maximum benefits provided or to be provided under the provisions of the Code or any other Applicable Law. (d) NO IMPAIRMENT OF RIGHTS. Rights under any Stock Award granted before amendment of the Plan shall not be materially impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the Participant and (ii) the Participant consents in writing. (e) AMENDMENT OF STOCK AWARDS.

which approval shall be within twelve (12) months before or after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board. 15. GOVERNING LAW.
