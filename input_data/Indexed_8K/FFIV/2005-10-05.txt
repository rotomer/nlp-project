Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
     On October 4, 2005, F5 Networks, Inc. ("F5") completed its previously announced acquisition of Swan Labs Corporation ("Swan Labs"), a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in San Jose, California that provides WAN (Wide Area Network) optimization and application acceleration products and services. The acquisition was made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 6, 2005, by and among F5, Sparrow Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of F5 ("Merger Sub"), Swan Labs and the stockholder representatives referred to therein (the "Merger Agreement"). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Swan Labs, with Swan Labs continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of F5 (the "Merger"). The aggregate purchase price payable to the former stockholders of Swan Labs was $43,000,000 in cash. $5,375,000 of the cash purchase price was placed in escrow for twelve (12) months as security for various indemnification obligations of the Swan Labs stockholders under the Merger Agreement. Prior to the closing of the Merger, there were no material relationships between or among F5 or any of its affiliates, officers or directors on the one hand, and Swan Labs or any of its affiliates, officers or directors on the other.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of September 6, 2005, by and among F5 Networks, Inc., a Washington corporation ("PARENT"), Sparrow Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), Swan Labs Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and, with respect to Sections 1.7.4 and 1.8 and Articles VII and VIII only, Matthew Howard and Andrew Foss, as the Stockholder Representatives (as defined below). RECITALS A. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub believe it advisable and in their respective best interests to effect a merger of the Company and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, whereby Merger Sub would be merged with and into the Company (the "MERGER"). B. The Board of Directors of the Company and the requisite number of stockholders of the Company have approved this Agreement and the Merger as required by applicable law. C. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement by the Company, in order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the stockholders of the Company identified on SCHEDULE C TO THE DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM (the "REQUIRED STOCKHOLDERS") shall have executed and delivered (a) a written consent in lieu of special meeting of the stockholders of the Company in the form attached as EXHIBIT 2.2(b)(1) hereto, approving, among other things, the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER CONSENT"); and (b) an Irrevocable Proxy in favor of Parent in substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT 2.2(b)(2). D. The Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and the sole stockholder of Merger Sub have approved this Agreement and the Merger as required by applicable law. E. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given such terms in Article X of this Agreement. AGREEMENT In consideration of the terms hereof, the parties hereto agree as follows: -1-
ARTICLE I - THE MERGER 1.1 THE MERGER Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, (a) at the Effective Time the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have all the effects of a merger under the laws of the State of Delaware and other applicable law. 1.2 THE CLOSING Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place on the earliest practicable business day (the "CLOSING DATE") after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Articles IV and V at 10 a.m. local time at the offices of DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary US LLP, 701 Fifth Avenue, Suite 7000, Seattle, WA 98104, or such other date, time or location as Parent and the Company shall agree; provided, however, that in no event shall the Closing Date be prior to October 1, 2005. 1.3 EFFECTIVE DATE AND TIME On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the parties hereto shall cause a certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") complying with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DELAWARE LAW") to be properly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "DELAWARE SECRETARY OF STATE"). The Merger shall become effective on the date (the "EFFECTIVE DATE") and at the time (the "EFFECTIVE TIME") of filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such other time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger as filed. If the Delaware Secretary of State requires any changes in the Certificate of Merger as a condition to filing or to issuing its certificate to the effect that the Merger is effective, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company, as appropriate, will execute any necessary revisions incorporating such changes, provided such changes are not inconsistent with and do not result in any material change in the terms of this Agreement. 1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION Unless otherwise specified by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety as of the Effective Time to conform to the certificate of incorporation attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1.4. Thereafter, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation may be amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by law. -2-
1.5 BYLAWS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION Unless otherwise specified by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to conform to the bylaws attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1.5. Thereafter, the bylaws may be amended or repealed in accordance with their terms and the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by law. 1.6 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS At the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Company shall resign and the directors of Merger Sub shall continue in office as the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of Merger Sub shall continue in office as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall hold office in accordance with and subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 1.7 CONVERSION OF SHARES 1.7.1 MERGER CONSIDERATION Subject to the provisions below, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company ("COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK") shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent an aggregate sum of $43,000,000 in cash (the "PURCHASE PRICE") and the following shall occur: (a) All shares of any class of Company Capital Stock held by the Company as treasury shares shall be cancelled. (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 1.7.2 below, the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Company Capital Stock as follows: (i) Each issued and outstanding share of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock (the "COMPANY SERIES A STOCK"), other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section 1.7.1(a) and Dissenting Shares, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent an amount of cash equal to Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration. (ii) Each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock of the Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section 1.7.1(a) and Dissenting Shares, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Common Stock Consideration. (iii) The amount of cash to be paid to each stockholder of the Company under this Section 1.7.1(b) shall be calculated by aggregating all shares of Company Capital Stock held by each such stockholder, so that such amount of cash to be paid shall be equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such -3-
stockholder multiplied by the Per Share Common Stock Consideration, and (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Series A Stock held by such stockholder multiplied by the Per Share Preferred Stock Consideration, in each case rounded to the nearest $0.01, with $0.005 being rounded up. (c) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. (d) All options, warrants or other outstanding rights to purchase or otherwise acquire Company Capital Stock (together, the "COMPANY OPTIONS") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated in accordance with Section 6.11 hereof. 1.7.2 ESCROW Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to effectiveness of the Merger, an aggregate of (a) $4,300,000 in cash (the "BASE ESCROW AMOUNT") and (b) $1,075,000 in cash (the "SPECIAL ESCROW AMOUNT" and, together with the Base Escrow Amount, the "ESCROW AMOUNT") from the Purchase Price shall be deposited in escrow (the "ESCROW") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "ESCROW AGENT"), to be held and administered in accordance with an Escrow Agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT"), such Escrow Amount to be deducted, pro rata based on the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to be received by each holder of Company Capital Stock under Section 1.7.1(b), from the aggregate amount otherwise payable to each such holder of Company Capital Stock as of the Effective Time. By approving the Merger at a special meeting of the stockholders or by written consent or by delivering a Letter of Transmittal and their certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.7.4, the stockholders shall agree (i) that the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable to each such stockholder pursuant to Section 1.7.1 shall be reduced by their respective portions of the Escrow Amount, which amounts will be set forth on the Consideration Allocation Certificate, and (ii) to be bound with respect to the indemnification obligations of the stockholders and the procedures set forth in Article VIII. In accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will take all steps necessary to enable it or the Surviving Corporation to deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount by wire transfer in immediately available funds, all to be managed and paid out by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 1.7.3 APPRAISAL RIGHTS AND DISSENTERS' RIGHTS Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Stock held by a holder who has demanded and perfected such holder's right for appraisal or rights of dissent of such shares in accordance with California Law or Delaware Law, as the case may be, and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal or right of dissent ("DISSENTING SHARES"), if any, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but -4-
shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to California Law or Delaware Law, as the case may be. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demand for appraisal or notice of dissent received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand or notice. The Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, or as required under California Law or Delaware Law, as the case may be, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand or notice. Each holder of Dissenting Shares (a "DISSENTING Stockholder") who, pursuant to the provisions of California Law or Delaware Law, as the case may be, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value for shares of Company Capital Stock shall receive payment therefor (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, Parent shall issue and deliver, upon surrender by such stockholder of a certificate or certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock, the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such stockholder would otherwise be entitled under this Section 1.7.3 and this Agreement less the portion of the Merger Consideration allocable to such stockholder that has been deposited with the Escrow Agent in respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 1.7.2. To the extent that Parent or the Company makes any payment in respect of any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall be entitled to recover under Article VIII hereof (i) the aggregate amount by which such payment (plus the amounts paid at the Effective Time) exceeds the Merger Consideration allocable to such stockholder and (ii) any other costs and expenses, including attorney fees and expenses, incurred in connection with investigating, defending and settling such demands for appraisal (the amounts in clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, "EXCESS DISSENTING SHARE PAYMENTS"). 1.7.4 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate an agent (which may be Parent or a subsidiary of Parent) to act as a disbursement or exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger. (b) Parent or the Exchange Agent shall cause to be mailed, no later than 20 days prior to the Closing Date, to each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock and each holder of Company Options: (i) a letter of transmittal (the "LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL") containing (A) an agreement to be obligated for such holder's pro rata potion of the indemnification obligations set forth in Article VIII below, and (B) an obligation to execute and deliver the Stockholder Agreement, which document is substantially in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1.7.4; and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for a portion of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents specified in the Letter of Transmittal, and immediately following the Closing, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check or wire transfer representing the portion of the Merger -5-
Consideration that such stockholder of the Company is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.7.1 as of the Effective Time. If any certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the stockholder of the Company claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in form satisfactory to Parent, and delivery of the Letter of Transmittal, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the portion of the Merger Consideration that such stockholder of the Company is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.7.1; provided, however, that Parent may in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require such stockholder to provide Parent with an indemnity agreement against any Claim that may be made against Parent with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. No interest shall accrue on the Merger Consideration. Unless otherwise approved by Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Merger Consideration (or any portion thereof) shall be delivered only to the Person in whose name the certificate or certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Parent nor any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable law, including abandoned property, escheat and similar laws. (c) Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration such amounts as Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to either the making of such payment under the Code or acquiring and/or disposing the shares of Company Capital Stock (through exercise of options or otherwise), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, provided that no amount of Merger Consideration shall be withheld with respect to Taxes arising from the acquisition of shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to option exercises unless the Company has failed to comply with applicable Tax withholding requirements in respect thereto. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the Company Capital Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding is made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing, the stockholders of the Company will provide Parent or the Exchange Agent any Forms W-9 or other certificates or forms required to allow Parent or the Exchange Agent to meet its withholding obligations under the law. 1.7.5 NO FURTHER TRANSFERS After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of any shares of Company Capital Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be forwarded to Parent and shall be cancelled and exchanged in accordance with this Section 1.7, subject, in the case of Dissenting Shares, to Section 1.7.3. -6-
1.8 STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVES 1.8.1 POWER AND AUTHORITY; REPLACEMENT (a) By the approval of the Merger at a special meeting of stockholders or by written consent of the stockholders, or by execution of the Stockholder Agreement, each stockholder of the Company shall be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and appointed each of Matthew Howard and Andrew Foss (each a "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE" and together the "STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVES"), with full power of substitution and resubstitution, as his, her or its representative and true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent to act in his, her or its name, place and stead with respect to all matters arising in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, the power and authority, in their respective sole discretion, prior to and after the Effective Time, to: (i) take any action contemplated to be taken by the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement or any other Operative Document, including, without limitation, pursuant to Article VIII; (ii) negotiate, determine, defend and settle any disputes that may arise under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Operative Document, including, without limitation, with respect to any Indemnification Claim pursuant to Article VIII; and (iii) make, execute, acknowledge and deliver any releases, assurances, receipts, requests, instructions, notices, agreements, certificates and any other instruments, and generally do any and all things and take any and all actions that may be requisite, proper or advisable in connection with this Agreement or any other Operative Document, including, without limitation, pursuant to Article VIII. (b) At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, the former stockholders of the Company may, by written consent of the holders of a majority of the former shares of Company Capital Stock (based on the respective ownership amounts immediately prior to the Closing), appoint new representatives as the Stockholder Representatives, including in the event that any Stockholder Representative becomes unable or unwilling to continue in his capacity as Stockholder Representative, or if any Stockholder Representative resigns as a Stockholder Representative. Written notice, together with a copy of the written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures of the applicable stockholders, must be delivered to Parent and the Escrow Agent not less than ten (10) calendar days prior to such appointment. Upon approval of the new representative by Parent, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, such appointment will be effective upon the later of (i) the date indicated in the consent, (ii) the date that Parent approves such new representative or (iii) the date such written consent is received by Parent and the Escrow Agent. -7-
1.8.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (a) The Stockholder Representatives will incur no liability with respect to any action taken or suffered by any party in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by such Stockholder Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper person (and shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction, except his own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. In all questions arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Representatives may rely on the advice of outside counsel, and the Stockholder Representatives will not be liable to anyone for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Stockholder Representatives based on such advice.

The parties shall continue to comply with and to perform their respective obligations under the Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement between Parent and the Company entered into as of May 19, 2005, as amended through the date hereof (the "MUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT"). 6.3 NO ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTIONS Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its stockholders not to, directly or indirectly, through any stockholder, officer, director, agent or otherwise, solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to (a) any acquisition or purchase of all or any material portion of the assets of, or any equity interest in, the Company or any business combination with the Company (other than (x) sales of the Company's products in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (y) issuance of Company Capital Stock in connection with exercises of Company Options) or (b) any other transaction that could Reasonably Likely interfere, conflict or compete with the Merger and the other transactions described herein (collectively, an "ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION"), or participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate or negotiate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or -47-
encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has fully terminated all discussions and negotiations concerning an Alternative Transaction. The Company shall notify Parent promptly if any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact.

In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or the other Operative Documents, each party to this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take all such action. After the Closing, each party hereto, at the request of and without any further cost or expense to the other parties, will take any further actions necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or any other Operative Document, and to vest in the Surviving Corporation full title to all properties, assets and rights of the Company. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals -48-

The Company shall not, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company not to, make any statements to any stockholder of the Company regarding (a) the fair value of any shares of Company Capital Stock or (b) the appraisal rights and dissenters' rights process and procedures under California Law or Delaware Law except as set forth in the Stockholder Materials. 6.8 PUBLICITY At all times at or before the Closing and, except with respect to Parent, for one year following the Closing, no party hereto shall issue any press release or otherwise make any statements to any third party with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby other than (a) the issuance by Parent of a press release announcing this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any consultations with legal counsel, financial advisors or accountants necessary for a party to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or (c) as required by law. 6.9 TAX MATTERS (a) Parent shall be responsible for making or causing to be made proper and timely filings of all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company after the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall make or cause to be made proper, complete and accurate -49-
filings of all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company for any period prior to and including the Closing Date (the "PRIOR PERIOD"), including any Tax Returns for federal, state, local, foreign, income, sales, use, excise, property, gross receipts, VAT, GST or PST Tax and any required annual reports thereto (collectively, the "PRIOR PERIOD RETURNS"), which Tax Returns were required to filed by the Company prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall provide Parent with copies of each Prior Period Return prior to the filing of such Tax Return and shall be responsible for all Pre-Closing Taxes. (b) Any Tax sharing or similar agreements with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, Parent and the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

Such assistance shall include making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns and supporting material. The parties will provide each other with any records or information which may be relevant to such preparation, audit, examination, proceeding or determination. (d) The parties agree to treat any indemnification payment made pursuant to Article VIII as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for federal, state, and local income Tax purposes. (e) For all Tax Return filing purposes, the parties shall treat and report the Merger as a taxable sale by the stockholders of the Company of shares of Company Capital Stock to Parent in exchange for their allocable share of the Purchase Price as determined under this Agreement. 6.10 TERMINATION OF 401(k) PLANS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (a) The Company shall terminate each of its Employee Benefit Plans that constitutes a "Code Section 401(k) plan" (each such Employee Benefit Plan, a "COMPANY 401(k) PLAN") prior to the Closing Date, unless Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain (or cause Merger Sub to sponsor and maintain) such plan by providing the Company with written notice of such election not less than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that each Company 401(k) Plan with respect to which Parent has not provided the notice specified in the immediately preceding sentence has been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company's Board of Directors (the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to advance review and approval by Parent, -50-
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), effective not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. (b) Unless Parent shall otherwise agree in writing, the Company shall terminate, effective at least one day prior to the Closing Date, any other Employee Benefit Plan. The Company shall provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent to ensure that all liabilities of Company under all other Company Benefit Plans (including any liability relating to services performed prior to the Closing Date) shall be, effective as of such Company Benefit Plans' termination, either fully extinguished at no cost, and with no liability, to Parent, or accurately accounted for on Company's financial statements. 6.11 TREATMENT OF COMPANY OPTIONS Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provided a notice to each holder of an outstanding Company Option, including any options outstanding under the Company's 2004 Stock Option Plan, as amended and/or restated to date (the "COMPANY STOCK OPTION PLAN"), stating that the Company is requiring all holders of any Company Option to exercise all of the unexercised portion of the Company Options prior to if not properly exercised prior to, or contingent on, the Effective Time or suffer the forfeiture of the unexercised portion of the Company Stock Options. The Company shall take such actions necessary to cause the Company Options and any other securities and notes convertible at any time into Company Common Stock, vested and unvested, and regardless of restrictions on exercise or conversion, to be exercised or converted into shares of Company Common Stock, or be terminated, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Effective Time. All unexercised Company Stock Options and such other convertible securities shall be null and void following the Effective Time. 6.12 AWARD GRANTS Promptly following the Effective Time in accordance with Parent's standard practices, Parent will act to grant stock awards to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock (through stock options, stock purchase awards or similar rights) under any of the Company's shareholder-approved stock-based compensation plans, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion, to certain Retention Employees at an exercise per share equal to fair market value per share of Parent Common Stock on the date of grant, and with vesting in accordance with Parent's standard four-year vesting schedule for newly hired employees. The number of stock awards granted to each such Retention Employee shall be determined by Parent in the sole discretion; provided, however, that the number of stock awards granted to any such employee shall be no less than the amount granted to other new employees of Parent holding comparable positions and titles. 6.13 EMPLOYEE RETENTION POOL Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent will establish a pool in an amount equal to $2,000,000 (the "RETENTION POOL") that will be distributed to the Retention Employees -51-
pursuant to this Section 6.13 and SCHEDULES 6.13(a) AND 6.13(b) TO THE DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM. Except as set forth in SCHEDULES 6.13(a) AND 6.13(b) TO THE DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM, in the event that, by the expiration of the 18 month period following the Effective Time (the "RETENTION EXPIRATION DATE"), the milestones set forth in SCHEDULE 6.13(b) TO THE DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM (the "RETENTION MILESTONES") have been satisfactorily achieved (as determined in the manner set forth in such Schedule), promptly following the Retention Expiration Date, Parent shall pay those Retention Employees who are employed by Parent or its Affiliates on the Retention Expiration Date the amounts set forth opposite each such Retention Employee's name on SCHEDULE 6.13(a) TO THE DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM, which amounts equal each such Retention Employee's share of the Retention Pool. Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as set forth in SCHEDULES 6.13(a) AND 6.13(b) TO THE DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM, in the event that: (a) the Retention Milestones are not satisfactorily achieved by the Retention Expiration Date (as determined in the manner set forth in such Schedule), the Retention Pool shall immediately be forfeited to Parent and no Retention Employee shall be entitled to any portion of the Retention Pool; and (b) prior to the Retention Expiration Date, a Retention Employee (i) voluntarily ceases to be employed by Parent or its Affiliates or (ii) is terminated by Parent or its Affiliates for Cause, such Retention Employee shall immediately forfeit to Parent, without any action required on the part of such Retention Employee, the amount set forth opposite such Retention Employee's name on SCHEDULE 6.13(a) TO THE DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all amounts forfeited to Parent in accordance with the immediately prior sentence shall be distributed by Parent promptly following the Retention Expiration Date to those Retention Employees that are employed by Parent or its Affiliates on the Retention Expiration Date in such amounts as determined by the Chief Executive Officer of Parent in his sole discretion. The parties agree that (A) the Retention Pool shall neither be an adjustment to the Purchase Price nor reduce the number of stock awards described in Section 6.12, and (B) Parent is not obligated to provide any guaranteed return pursuant to any securities of Parent issued to the Retention Employees pursuant to this Section 6.13 or Section 6.12. 6.14 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS; SERVICE CREDIT Following the Effective Time, Parent or its affiliates will provide each Retention Employee employee benefits that are substantially equivalent to employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, and full credit for prior service with the Company for purposes of determination of benefits levels under any Parent policies relating to vacation or severance, in each case for which the Retention Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Retention Employee is offered participation, but except where such crediting would (A) result in a duplication of benefits or (B) otherwise cause Parent or its affiliates or any Parent employee benefit plan or trust relating thereto to pay for benefits that relate to any time period prior to the Retention Employee's participation in the Parent's employee benefit plan. 6.16 INDEMNIFICATION OF COMPANY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS From and after the Closing Date and for a period of six (6) years, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, fulfill the obligations of the Company to indemnify each Person who is -52-
or was a director, officer or employee of the Company as of the date of this Agreement against any losses such Person may incur based upon matters existing or occurring prior to the Closing pursuant to any applicable indemnification agreement and any indemnification provisions set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to the exculpation and indemnification and expense advancement that are at least as favorable to the directors, officers and employees of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers or employees of the Company, unless such modification is required by law. Nothing contained in this Section 6.16 shall be deemed to limit or prohibit any indemnification rights of a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to Article VIII. 6.17 UPDATED DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM Any updated Disclosure Memorandum delivered as of the Closing (as provided in Article II above) shall refer only to (x) disclosures of facts, events or circumstances contained in the Disclosure Memorandum delivered to Parent and dated as of the date of this Agreement, and (y) disclosures of facts, events or circumstances that have occurred or been discovered since the date of this Agreement, and any updated Disclosure Memorandum shall not otherwise limit or modify any of the representations and warranties made in this Agreement or the Disclosure Memorandum as of the date of this Agreement. No disclosure of a fact, event or circumstance on any updated Disclosure Memorandum shall be deemed to cure (i) any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or the Disclosure Memorandum as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) any failure to disclose such fact, event or circumstance on the previously delivered Disclosure Memorandum, or otherwise amend the previously delivered Disclosure Memorandum, unless agreed to in writing by Parent. 6.18 INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to parent an unaudited balance sheet, statement of income and expense, statement of cash flow and statement of stockholders' equity of the Company as of and for the one-month period ended August 30, 2005, which financial statements will have bee prepared in conformity with GAAP on a basis consistent with prior accounting periods and fairly present the financial position, results of operations and changes in financial position of the Company as of the dates and for the periods indicated, except that such financial statements may not contain footnotes required by GAAP. -53-

Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by Parent or the Company, as applicable, and any such extension or waiver by the Company shall be binding upon each stockholder of the Company. ARTICLE VIII - SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION 8.1 SURVIVAL All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in the other Operative Documents or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive the Closing for a period of 12 months after the Effective Time (the "SURVIVAL PERIOD"), and shall not be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made or any knowledge acquired with respect thereto, or by any notice delivered pursuant to Section 6.4; provided, however, that any Indemnification Claim based on fraud shall survive the Closing indefinitely. The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or in the other Operative Documents shall survive the Closing and shall continue until all obligations with -55-
respect thereto shall have been performed or satisfied or shall have been terminated in accordance with their terms. 8.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE HOLDERS OF COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, from and after the Closing, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each of their officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates (each, a "PARENT INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and together, the "PARENT INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") harmless from and against, and shall reimburse the Parent Indemnified Parties for, any and all losses, damages, debts, liabilities, obligations, judgments, orders, awards, writs, injunctions, decrees, fines, penalties, Taxes, costs or expenses (including, but not limited to, any reasonable out-of-pocket legal or accounting fees or expenses and any Taxes or other costs or damages arising under, caused by or related to Section 280G of the Code or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign law) ("LOSSES") arising out of: (i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or breach of, any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement, together with the Disclosure Memorandum as delivered upon execution of this Agreement, or in any other Operative Document; (ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply, in whole or in part, with any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or in any other Operative Document; (iii) any and all Pre-Closing Taxes; (iv) those Transaction Costs of the Company incurred in excess of $2,000,000 (as such amount is described and limited in Section 9.1 hereof); (v) any Excess Dissenting Share Payments; (vi) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or breach of, the representation and warranty set forth in Section 2.6(e); or (viii) any fraud by the Company. (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, from and after the Closing, each stockholder of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold each Parent Indemnified Party harmless from and against, and shall reimburse the Parent Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses arising out of: (i) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or breach of, any representation or warranty made by such stockholder in a Stockholder Agreement or in any other Operative Document to which such stockholder is a party; -56-
(ii) any failure by such stockholder to perform or comply, in whole or in part, with any covenant or agreement in a Stockholder Agreement or in any other Operative Document to which the stockholder is a party; or (iii) any fraud by such stockholder. 8.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY PARENT Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, from and after the Closing, Parent shall indemnify and hold the stockholders of the Company and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates (the "STOCKHOLDER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") harmless from and against, and shall reimburse the Stockholder Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses arising out of: (a) any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or breach of, any representation or warranty made by the Company or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in any other Operative Document; or (b) any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to perform or comply, in whole or in part, with any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or in any other Operative Document. 8.4 LIMITATIONS (a) Except for Losses based on any Excluded Claims, (i) the aggregate liability of all stockholders of the Company pursuant to this Article VIII or for any matter arising out of, relating to or resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be limited to the aggregate Escrow Amount and (ii) the aggregate liability of each stockholder of the Company shall be limited to such stockholder's portion of the aggregate Escrow Amount (based on the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to be received by each stockholder of the Company under Section 1.7.1(b)). The aggregate liability of Parent to all stockholders of the Company shall be limited to the Base Escrow Amount. (b) Any Person against whom an Indemnification Claim is being asserted (an "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") shall not be obligated to defend and hold harmless any Person claiming indemnification under this Article VIII (an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), or otherwise be liable to such Indemnified Party, with respect to any Indemnification Claim made by the Indemnified Party after the expiration of the Survival Period or other applicable time period described in Section 8.1, except that indemnity may be sought after the expiration of the Survival Period or other applicable time limitation if a Claim Notice with respect to such Indemnification Claim shall have been delivered to the Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of such time period. (c) No Indemnifying Party will be required to indemnify an Indemnified Party hereunder until such time as the aggregate amount of Loses for which (i) Parent Indemnified -57-
Parties, on the one hand, or (ii) the Stockholder Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII exceeds $100,000, at which time the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party for the full amount of such Losses subject to limitations of this Article VIII. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.4, the threshold limits imposed by this Section 8.4(c) shall not apply to any Losses arising out of or in connection with (A) any breach by the Company of Section 2.3 (Capitalization), Section 2.8 (Taxes), Section 2.16 (Intellectual Property), Section 2.25 (Brokers or Finders), or Section 2.6(e) (cash and cash equivalents), (B) any Excess Dissenting Share Payments or any Pre-Closing Taxes, or (C) any intentional or willful breaches of this Agreement, or fraud or similar circumstances. (d) The aggregate value of Indemnification Claims paid to Parent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to reduce the total Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 1.7. Subject to Section 8.7, any such Indemnification Claims shall be paid out of the Escrow Amount, pro rata, with respect to each stockholder of the Company, as determined by reference to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration such stockholder is entitled to receive in the Merger as compared to all other stockholders of the Company. No Claim for contribution or other Claim, whether under any indemnification agreement or pursuant to general principles of contribution, tort or other liability laws, shall be made by the stockholders of the Company against the Surviving Corporation for any Losses suffered by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with this Article VIII. 8.5 ESTABLISHMENT AND CONTESTING OF INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY (a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the "CLAIM NOTICE") of any Indemnification Claim (i) in the case of an Indemnification Claim against Parent, to Parent and (ii) in the case of an Indemnification Claim against the stockholders of the Company, to the Stockholder Representative, reasonably promptly, but in any event (A) prior to expiration of any survival period for such Indemnification Claim and (B) if such Indemnification Claim relates to the assertion against an Indemnified Party of any Claim by a third party (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), within thirty (30) days after assertion of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any obligation or liability that the Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Party except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend or resolve such Indemnification Claim is materially and adversely affected thereby. Any such Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances on which the asserted Indemnification Claim is based, specify the amount of such Indemnification Claim if then ascertainable and, if not then ascertainable, the estimated amount thereof, and shall specify how such Indemnified Party intends to recover such amount pursuant to this Agreement. (b) Unless the Indemnifying Party contests in a writing given to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice that Losses identified in such Claim Notice constitute indemnifiable claims or the amount of such -58-
alleged Losses (a "CONTEST NOTICE"), the Indemnified Party shall, subject to the other terms of this Article VIII, be paid the amount of the Losses related to such Indemnification Claim or the uncontested portion thereof in accordance with Section 8.5(c). An Indemnifying Party shall not object to any Indemnification Claim unless (i) it believes in good faith that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified with respect to the Losses specified therein, or (ii) it lacks sufficient information to assess the validity or amount of the Indemnification Claim or Loses that are in dispute. If the Indemnifying Party objects to an Indemnification Claim on the basis that it lacks sufficient information, it shall promptly request from the Indemnified Party any additional information reasonably necessary for it to assess such Indemnification Claim and the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent the Indemnified Party reasonably can, provide additional information reasonably requested. Upon receipt of such additional information, the Indemnifying Party shall review it as soon as reasonably practicable and notify the Indemnified Party of any withdrawal or modification of the objection. If a Contest Notice relating to a non-Third Party Claim is given in such time period, and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to reach agreement with respect to any contested Losses within thirty (30) days of the delivery of the Contest Notice, the matter shall be settled by binding arbitration in Seattle, Washington as set forth in Section 9.7 below. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cause the arbitrator to decide the matter to be arbitrated pursuant hereto within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision with respect to such a Contest Notice shall relate solely to whether the Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified for the contested Losses, or the contested portion thereof, pursuant to the applicable terms of this Agreement. The final decision of the arbitrator shall be furnished to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in writing and shall constitute the conclusive determination of the issue in question binding upon the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and shall not be contested by any of them. Such decision may be used in a court of law only for the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrator's decision. If a Contest Notice relating to a Third Party Claim is given in such 30-day time period, such Third Party Claim shall be deemed an Open Claim under Section 8.5(d). (c) Upon final determination of the amount of the Losses that is the subject of an Indemnification Claim, whether such determination is the result of an Indemnifying Party's acceptance of, or failure to contest, a Claim Notice, or a resolution of any dispute with respect thereto by agreement of the parties, or a final, non-appealable court order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or pursuant to Section 8.6(c) or otherwise (each, "FINALLY DETERMINED LOSSES"), the Indemnifying Party or parties shall be obligated to pay the amount of such Finally Determined Losses within five (5) days of such final determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Finally Determined Losses that are payable to any Parent Indemnified Party and must be resolved through the Escrow Amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, subject to the exclusions and limitations set forth in this Article VIII. -59-
8.6 DEFENSE AND SETTLEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS.
