Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE, WA  October 25, 2005  F5 Networks, Inc . (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $80.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, up 10 percent from $73.1 million in the prior quarter and 61 percent from $50.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Fourth quarter net income was $15.7 million ($0.39 per diluted share) compared to net income of $15.8 million ($.43 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter a year ago. For fiscal 2005, the company reported record annual revenue of $281.4 million, up 64 percent from $171.1 million in fiscal 2004. Net income for the year was $51.7 million ($1.34 per diluted share) compared to net income of $32.9 million ($0.92 per diluted share) in fiscal 2004.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company began expensing stock-based compensation. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, F5 became subject to income taxes on U.S. income and also reversed the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets. The company is presenting pro forma annual and fourth quarter net income for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 to eliminate the impact of these items and report net income on a comparable basis.
On a pro forma basis, net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was $19.0 million ($0.47 per diluted share) compared to net income of $14.0 million ($0.35 per diluted share) in the third quarter and $7.3 million ($0.20 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and net income for fiscal 2005 was $55.1 million ($1.42 per diluted share) compared to $18.9 million ($0.52 per diluted share) for fiscal 2004.
A reconciliation of reported net income to pro forma net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam said the company's second consecutive year of strong revenue growth resulted from growing demand for application delivery networking products that enhance the security, performance and availability of Web-based applications. "In addition, the
 
introduction of our new TMOS-based products in September 2004 has enabled us to leverage this growing demand by delivering integrated application delivery networking solutions that are demonstrably superior in functionality and performance. Both increasing awareness of the F5 brand and accelerating demand for the new products drove our growth throughout the year and propelled the company to a strong finish, with Q4 product revenue up 67 percent year-over-year."
"With solid sequential revenue growth and gross margin steady at 77 percent, we continued to see further improvements in our operating results during the fourth quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, which we began expensing in Q4, we achieved an operating margin of 31 percent, compared to 27 percent in the prior quarter and 20 percent in the fourth quarter a year ago. On the balance sheet, $32.7 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter helped boost cash and investments to $365 million at year end."
As a result of the growing demand for application delivery networking solutions, coupled with the strength of the company's current offerings and plans for the delivery and integration of new technology, McAdam said he expects the company's growth to continue in fiscal 2006. "Earlier this month, we completed our acquisition of Swan Labs, rounding out our capabilities in application acceleration and WAN optimization. During the current quarter, we expect Swan's products  Web Accelerator and WANJet  to begin contributing to our top-line growth, and over the next 12 months, we plan to migrate both products to TMOS. Also this month, we announced the availability of TrafficShield, our application firewall, as an application security module on BIG-IP, and early customer response to this tightly integrated solution has been very positive."
"Moving ahead into the first quarter of fiscal 2006, I believe F5's technology leadership, strong partnerships, channel leverage, and sound business model will further strengthen our competitive position and enable us to deliver continued sequential growth." For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, McAdam said the company's revenue target is $85 million to $87 million. Earnings for the first quarter are expected to be $0.33 to $0.34 per diluted share, including the charge for stock-based compensation. Excluding the compensation charge, the anticipated earnings range would have been $0.44 to $0.45 per diluted share.
