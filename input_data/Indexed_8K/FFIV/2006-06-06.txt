Item 8.01 Other Events
On May 24, 2006, a person claiming to be a shareholder of F5 Networks (the "Company") filed a derivative complaint in the Superior Court of Washington, King County, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain current and former executives of the Company and certain current and former members of the Company's Board. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain defendants breached their fiduciary duties between 2000 and 2004 by (i) backdating stock option grants in a manner which was intended to, and did, unduly benefit certain defendants at the expense of the Company, and (ii) knowingly filing false financial statements and other public filings. The complaint also alleges that certain defendants were unjustly enriched by their receipt and retention of the purported backdated stock option grants.
The Company does not intend to file further current reports on Form 8-K describing additional lawsuits, if any, in either federal or state court, which are based on allegations related to the Company's purported backdating of stock option grants.
