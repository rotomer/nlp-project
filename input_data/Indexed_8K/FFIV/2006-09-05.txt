Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 1, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of F5 Networks, Inc. (the "Company") approved a compensation arrangement for the members of all current and future special committees of the Board, including the special committee that had been created to conduct a further review of the Company's historical stock option practices and the special committee that had been created to investigate, evaluate and consider one or more new "independent directors." Upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board, the Board approved paying the members of such committees at the same then-current rate and on the same then-current terms payable to members of the Company's current standing Board committees for their participation on such other committees. As such, each member of a special committee will be paid $750.00 for each special committee meeting attended by such member in person or by telephone, including meetings attended by such members prior to September 1, 2006. Such compensation is in addition to the fees payable to directors for their service on the Board and its committees and for attendance at Board meetings or meetings of the other Board committees.
