Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, F5 Networks announced revenue of $120.0 million, up 7 percent from $111.7 million in the prior quarter and 36 percent from $88.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Net income was $22.4 million ($0.53 per diluted share), compared to $17.8 million ($0.43 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $15.2 million ($0.37 per diluted share) in the first quarter a year ago.
SEATTLE, WAJanuary 24, 2007
According to F5 president and chief executive officer John McAdam, the company's revenue growth during the quarter was driven primarily by strong enterprise sales in North America. "Including Central and South America, revenue for the Americas grew 13 percent sequentially and 39 percent year over year. Growth in Europe was solid while Asia-Pacific revenue was down slightly from the prior quarter. Japan revenue was also down sequentially, but was consistent with the seasonal pattern we've seen there during the past three years.
"In addition to solid growth in our core business, which accounted for 90% of total revenue, security and WAN optimization revenue grew sequentially. As FirePass and WANJet become available on TMOS at the end of fiscal 2007, we believe the integration of these products will add further impetus to sales of our core products," McAdam said.
"With respect to our core products, I'm happy to report that we have completed beta testing of the BIG-IP 8800, equipped with TMOS-based BIG-IP version 9.4 software, and that it will be generally available this quarter. The 8800 platform allows customers to apply more value to applications as they flow across the network by delivering the fastest decision-per-second performance in the industry at the application layer  where it matters most."
In comparison to the BIG-IP 8400, currently the performance leader in application delivery networking, the BIG-IP 8800 delivers a 50% increase in Layer 7 throughput and doubles SSL and compression throughput. Based on published reports, the BIG-IP 8800 is more than twice as fast as the nearest competing product in all three areas.
 
"Combined with the advanced capabilities of BIG-IP 9.4, the BIG-IP 8800 reduces total cost of ownership while delivering performance and broad functionality to meet the most demanding needs of enterprise customers and internet service providers. Feedback from extended beta-tests with more than two dozen customers has been very positive, and we are confident the BIG-IP 8800 will enable us to penetrate new accounts and quickly become the new high-end standard for many of our existing customers," McAdam said.
Along with its solid gains in revenue and income, F5 continued to strengthen its balance sheet during the first quarter. Reflecting the strong growth of its services business, deferred revenue increased 14% to $68.7 million at quarter end. Cash flow from operations was $46.8 million, and the company ended the quarter with $545 million in cash and investments.
For the current quarter, ending March 31, 2007, McAdam said management has set a target range of $124 million to $126 million in revenue with an earnings target of $0.44 to $0.46 per diluted share.
