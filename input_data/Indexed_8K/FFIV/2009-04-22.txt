Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEATTLE, April 22, 2009  F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) today announced revenue of $154.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, down seven percent from $165.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and three percent from $159.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
GAAP net income for the second quarter was $19.0 million ($0.24 per diluted share) compared to $21.4 million ($0.27 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2009 and $17.7 million ($0.21 per diluted share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, a restructuring charge, and a charge for a patent-related legal settlement, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $30.3 million ($0.38 per diluted share), compared to $32.3 million ($0.40 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $28.9 million ($0.35 per diluted share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"Continued weakening in the global economy impacted sales across all regions," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "On a year-over-year basis, February sales were particularly slow, and although March sales improved significantly, revenue for the quarter was below our guidance."
"Despite the challenging economic environment, revenue from our core application delivery controller business was flat as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2008, and revenue from our file virtualization business grew sequentially from the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We were also pleased that as a result of our aggressive cost-reduction and expense-control initiatives, we exceeded both our operating margin and cash flow targets for the quarter," McAdam said.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2009, ending June 30, the company has set a revenue target of $148 million to $157 million and a GAAP earnings target of $0.22 to $0.25 per diluted share. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $0.35 to $0.38 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Such factors include, but are not limited to: customer acceptance of our new traffic management, security, application delivery, WAN optimization and storage virtualization offerings; the timely development, introduction and acceptance of additional new
 
products and features by F5 or its competitors; competitive pricing pressures; increased sales discounts; uncertain global economic conditions which may result in reduced customer demand for our products and services and changes in customer payment patterns; F5's ability to sustain, develop and effectively utilize distribution relationships; F5's ability to attract, train and retain qualified product development, marketing, sales, professional services and customer support personnel; F5's ability to expand in international markets; the unpredictability of F5's sales cycle; the share repurchase program; future prices of F5's common stock; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in our documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation. Net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."
Management believes that net income excluding stock-based compensation (non-GAAP) provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
The reconciliation of the company's GAAP and non-GAAP second quarter earnings also excludes a restructuring charge related to a loss on facility exit and workforce reduction and a legal settlement
 
charge. This restructuring charge was incurred during the second quarter in connection with a reduction in the company's workforce and the consolidation of certain of the company's office space.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's business, which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. For example, stock-based compensation is an obligation of the Company that should be considered and each line item is important to financial performance generally. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into its operational performance and financial results.
