          The parties intend that this Agreement and the payments and benefits provided hereunder be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A to the maximum extent possible, whether pursuant to the short-term deferral exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the involuntary separation pay plan exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), or otherwise.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement is intended to be interpreted and operated to the fullest extent possible so that the payments and benefits under this Agreement either shall be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A or shall comply with the requirements of such provision; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement in no event shall the Company be liable to the Executive for or with respect to any taxes, penalties or interest that may be imposed upon the Executive pursuant to Code Section 409A.
          
19.1 Payments to Specified Employees.
          To the extent that any payment or benefit pursuant to this Agreement constitutes a 409A Payment treated as payable upon Separation from Service, then, if on the date of the Executive's Separation from Service, the Executive is a Specified Employee, then to the extent required for the Executive not to incur additional taxes pursuant to Code Section 409A, no such 409A Payment shall be made to the Executive earlier than the earlier of (a) six (6) months after the Executive's Separation from Service or (b) the date of the Executive's death. Should this Section 19 result in the delay of benefits, any such benefit shall be made available to the Executive by the Company during such delay period at the Executive's expense. Should this Section 19.1 result in a delay of payments or benefits to the Executive, on the first day any such payments or benefits may be made without incurring additional tax pursuant to Code Section 409A (the ""), the Company shall make such payments and provide such benefits as provided for in this Agreement, provided that any amounts that would have been payable earlier but for the application of this Section 19.1 as well as reimbursement of the amount the Executive paid for benefits pursuant to the preceding sentence, shall be paid in a lump sum on the 409A Payment Date.

19.2 Reimbursements.
          For purposes of complying with Code Section 409A and without extending the payment timing otherwise provided in this Agreement, taxable reimbursements under this Agreement, subject to the following sentence and to the extent required to comply with Code Section 409A,
 
will be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year the expense was incurred. To the extent required to comply with Code Section 409A, any taxable reimbursements and any in-kind benefit under this Agreement will be subject to the following: (a) payment of such reimbursements or in-kind benefits during one calendar year will not affect the amount of such reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided during any other calendar year (other than for medical reimbursement arrangements as excepted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv)(B) solely because the arrangement provides for a limit on the amount of expenses that may be reimbursed under such arrangement over some or all of the period the arrangement remains in effect); (b) such right to reimbursements or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another form of compensation to the Executive; and (c) the right to reimbursements under this Agreement will be in effect for the lesser of the time specified in this Agreement or ten (10) years plus the lifetime of the Executive. Any taxable reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall be treated as not subject to Code Section 409A to the maximum extent provided by Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) or otherwise under Code Section 409A.
          
19.3 Release.
          Subject to Section 19.1 hereof, (a) to the extent that the Executive is required to execute and deliver a release to receive a 409A Payment and (b) this Agreement provides for such 409A Payment to be provided prior to the 55th day following the Executive's Separation from Service, such 409A Payment will be provided upon the 55th day following the Executive's Separation from Service, provided that the release in the form acceptable to the Company, in its reasonable discretion, has been executed, delivered and effective prior to such time. To the extent there is a delay in providing a 409A Payment because of the provisions of this Section 19.3, interest for the delay and the opportunity for the Executive to pay for benefits in the interim with subsequent reimbursement from the Company shall be provided in a manner consistent with that set forth in Section 19.1 hereof. If a release is required for a 409A Payment and such release is not executed, delivered and effective by the 55th day following the Executive's Separation from Service, such 409A Payment shall not be provided to the Executive to the extent that providing such 409A Payment would cause such 409A Payment to fail to comply with Code Section 409A.
          
19.4 No Acceleration; Separate Payments.
          No 409A Payment payable under this Agreement shall be subject to acceleration or to any change in the specified time or method of payment, except as otherwise provided under this Agreement and consistent with Code Section 409A. If under this Agreement, a 409A Payment is to be paid in two or more installments, for purposes of Section 409A, each installment shall be treated as a separate payment.
