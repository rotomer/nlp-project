ITEM: Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
This Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment ("Amendment No. 1") to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by F5 Networks, Inc. (the "Company") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 17, 2011 ("Original Filing"). The purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is to disclose the Company's decision on how frequently it will conduct future shareholder advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to its named executive officers. This Form 8-K/A does not otherwise revise the Original Filing in any way.
The Board has considered the appropriate frequency of future non-binding advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to its named executive officers. While the Board continues to believe that such future advisory votes on executive compensation are more effective and appropriate if conducted every three years, the Board has considered the voting results at the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting with respect to this non-binding advisory vote. The Board has decided that future non-binding advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to its named executive officers will be submitted to shareholders of the Company on an annual basis.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
