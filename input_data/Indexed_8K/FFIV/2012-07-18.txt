FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $352.6 million, up 3.8 percent from $339.6 million in the prior quarter and 21.3 percent from $290.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
SEATTLE, WAJuly 18, 2012
GAAP net income was $72.3 million ($0.91 per diluted share), compared to $68.6 million ($0.86 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $62.5 million ($0.77 per diluted share) in the third quarter a year ago.
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges and related tax effects, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $90.6 million ($1.14 per diluted share), compared to $87.1 million ($1.09 per diluted share) in the prior quarter and $79.4 million ($0.97 per diluted share) in the third quarter of last year.
A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.
"During the third quarter, F5's revenue and earnings continued to grow sequentially and year over year despite a more cautious spending environment," said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. "Overall, revenue growth slowed in Q3, but revenue by region was generally consistent with historical patterns; 57 percent for the Americas (primarily the United States) and 43 percent for EMEA and APJ, with EMEA contributing 21 percent of the total.
"As in the prior quarter, our security offerings were a key driver of product sales and accounted for a growing percentage of total revenue. In addition, we saw continued strong uptake of VIPRION 2400 along with increasing adoption of TMOS version 11.
"During the next six to nine months we are on track to deliver several new products, including a refresh of our BIG-IP appliance family, new policy enforcement capability for service providers and an eight-blade VIPRION chassis.
 
"Meanwhile, we are continuing to strengthen our organization and our financial position. In the third quarter, we added 100 employees, increased deferred revenue to $434 million and generated $113 million in cash from operations. After repurchasing 425,088 shares of our outstanding common stock we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and investments."
In light of the cautious spending environment in the current global economy, McAdam said management has set a revenue goal of $360 million to $370 million with a GAAP earnings target of $0.90 to $0.93 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, ending September 30. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges and related tax effects, the company's non-GAAP earnings target is $1.16 to $1.19 per diluted share.
A reconciliation of the company's expected GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is provided in the following table:

Use of non-GAAP Financial Information
F5's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and
 
acquisition-related charges, net of taxes, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges. This measure of non-GAAP net income is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company's tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 CompensationStock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718"). Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contribute to revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to revenues in future periods. Acquisition-related expenses consist of professional services fees incurred in connection with acquisitions.
Management believes that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company's core business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company's historical operating results. Although F5's management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the core business, management's reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5's management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company's core business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.
F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company's core business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company's performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the company's operational performance and financial results.
For reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the section in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations entitled "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation."
