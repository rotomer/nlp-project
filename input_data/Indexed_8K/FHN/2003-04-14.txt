FTNC Reports Record First Quarter Earnings for 2003 Business Editors NOTE TO MEDIA: Multimedia assets available A spreadsheet is available at URL: http://www.businesswire.com/photowire/pw.041403/bb3.xls MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 14, 2003--First Tennessee National Corporation (FTNC) announced today that it reported record first quarter earnings of $119.0 million, or $.91 diluted earnings per share, compared with last year's earnings of $87.1 million, or $.67 diluted earnings per share. This represents 37 percent growth from first quarter 2002 earnings. Return on average shareholders' equity and return on average assets for first quarter 2003 were 27.7 percent and 2.07 percent, respectively, and were 23.6 percent and 1.77 percent for first quarter 2002, respectively. Total assets were $24.8 billion, shareholders' equity was $1.8 billion and market capitalization was $5.0 billion on March 31, 2003, compared to $19.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, on March 31, 2002. FTNC has earned a spot on the list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens released by Business Ethics magazine. The ranking is based on quantitative measures of corporate service to seven stakeholder groups: stockholders, employees, customers, the community, the environment, overseas stakeholders, and women and minorities. According to Business Ethics, "The cutting-edge practices of these firms offer model business strategies in good corporate citizenship." "The results from first quarter 2003 continue the momentum from last year's record earnings," said Ken Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer of FTNC. "Once again, First Horizon Home Loans and FTN Financial led the way as expected given the current business environment. These record earnings give us the flexibility to invest in opportunities that will accelerate the expansion of our national delivery strategy and enhance our profitability in the future." First Horizon's national businesses achieved one of their best quarters of earnings as First Horizon Home Loans produced $11.5 billion of originations. First Horizon capitalized on the recent refinancing activity through continued expansion of the sales force and streamlined back office operations. Due to the exceptional earnings, this quarter's expenses throughout FTNC include investments in initiatives designed to promote expense efficiencies and enhance revenue growth. Additionally, FTN Financial achieved record earnings by broadening its products and customer base. As expected in the current environment, First Tennessee Banking Group's revenues were impacted by compression in the net interest margin. Total revenues increased 40 percent in first quarter 2003 to $711.5 million compared to $509.3 million in first quarter 2002. Noninterest income provides the majority of FTNC's revenue and contributed 73 percent to total revenue in first quarter 2003 compared to 64 percent in first quarter 2002. First quarter 2003 noninterest income increased 59 percent to $518.1 million from $324.9 million in 2002. A more detailed discussion by segment follows. Business Segments First Horizon Pre-tax income for First Horizon increased 189 percent to $119.2 million for first quarter 2003, compared to $41.2 million for first quarter 2002. Total revenues were $351.9 million in first quarter 2003, an increase of 93 percent from $182.2 million in 2002. Net interest income increased 40 percent to $73.4 million in 2003 from $52.6 million. Net interest income in First Horizon Equity Lending increased $7.5 million primarily due to an increase of 166 percent in home equity lines of credit which averaged $1.6 billion for first quarter 2003 compared to $.6 billion in 2002. The remaining increase of $13.3 million in net interest income reflects the impact of a larger portfolio of loans held for sale (warehouse) which grew 67 percent to $4.1 billion from $2.5 billion in first quarter 2002. Net interest spread on the warehouse, however, was negatively impacted by lower mortgage rates. Noninterest income increased 115 percent to $278.5 million in 2003 compared to $129.6 million in 2002. Noninterest income consists primarily of mortgage banking-related fees from the origination process, fees from mortgage servicing and mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net hedge gains or losses. Total fee income is net of amortization, impairment and other expenses related to MSR and related hedges. Loan origination volumes increased 117 percent in 2003 to $11.5 billion. In addition, loans securitized and sold into the secondary market increased 84 percent to $11.6 billion. Driven by low mortgage interest rates, refinance activity represented 79 percent of total originations during first quarter 2003 compared to 62 percent in first quarter 2002. Home purchase related originations grew 20 percent in 2003, demonstrating First Horizon's success in penetrating the purchase market. Due to the more stable nature of this market, which is not as vulnerable to interest rates, First Horizon's access to the purchase market should help support production levels when mortgage rates rise. Fees from the origination process increased 95 percent to $245.0 million compared to $125.5 million in 2002. This increase reflects growth in origination fees, in revenue recognized on loans sold, in the value recognized on loans in process, and higher net secondary marketing trading gains, which were influenced by the favorable interest rate environment experienced during the year. Fees associated with mortgage servicing increased 10 percent to $45.4 million in first quarter 2003. On March 31, 2003, the mortgage-servicing portfolio was $58.2 billion, an increase of 25 percent compared to $46.7 billion on March 31, 2002. The sustained growth of this asset in a period of historically high prepayment levels was made possible, in part, by the recapture of refinances from the existing servicing portfolio. MSR amortization was $31.1 million for first quarter 2003 compared with $29.7 million in first quarter 2002. In 2003 there was a MSR impairment loss of $42.5 million compared to a $31.4 million loss in 2002. Net MSR hedging gains (including the effect of time decay) were $38.0 million in 2003 compared to $15.0 million net gains in 2002. The interest rate environment in 2003 impacted increased net hedge gains and increased MSR amortization and impairment losses. The provision for loan losses was $11.8 million in 2003 compared to $11.3 million in 2002. The increased provision reflects the impact of a higher level of loans, which was largely offset by improvement in the risk profile of the retail loan portfolio due to the sale of Money Center loans in 2002, certain classified and nonperforming loans being transferred to available for sale and whole-loan insurance being provided for a segment of the retail loan portfolio. Going forward, exclusive of expected loan growth, net charge-offs and the provision for loan losses should decrease due to the improvements in the risk profile of the retail loan portfolio. Noninterest expense increased 70 percent in 2003 to $220.9 million compared to $129.7 million in 2002. The growth was primarily the result of an increase of 68 percent in personnel expense resulting from higher salary and commission expense related to the increased mortgage origination volume produced during 2003. In addition, a lease arrangement with a single-purpose entity for First Horizon's main office headquarters was terminated, and as a result, losses of $14.0 million were incurred in first quarter 2003. Termination of the lease arrangement will result in lower costs in future periods. Going forward, the existing level of loans in process (pipeline) due to an as yet unabated surge in applications currently indicates a continuation of record origination levels. Excluding the impact of the pipeline, fee income from refinance loan originations will generally depend on mortgage interest rates. An increase in rates should reduce origination fees and profit from the sale of loans, but should also reduce MSR amortization expense and impairment losses, while a decrease in rates should increase this net revenue. Flat to rising interest rates should reduce net secondary marketing trading gains, while falling rates should increase this net revenue. If total origination volume increases and/or the yield curve steepens, net interest income from the warehouse should increase, while if volume decreases and/or the yield curve flattens, this revenue should decrease. Continued success in our national cross-sell strategies should increase revenues from products other than traditional mortgage origination and servicing. First Tennessee Banking Group Pre-tax income for First Tennessee Banking Group (previously referred to as FTN Banking Group) decreased 45 percent to $35.6 million for first quarter 2003, compared to $64.9 million for the same period in 2002. Total revenues for the segment were $177.6 million, a decrease of 7 percent from $191.7 million in first quarter 2002. Net interest income decreased 11 percent to $104.5 million from $118.0 million in 2002. The decline in net interest income was related to compression in the net interest margin from traditional banking activities, primarily due to a change in the mix of the loan portfolio to floating rate products and due to the repricing of term assets in this low interest rate environment. Noninterest income remained relatively flat at $74.2 million compared to $73.7 million in 2002. Trust and investment management fees continue to be negatively impacted by contraction of equity market valuations, however, this impact is offset by improvement in insurance and other revenue sources. Noninterest expense increased 13 percent in 2003 to $126.1 million from $111.4 million last year. Contributing to this increase were expenses associated with initiatives focused on benefiting future earnings and higher pension and employee related costs, with a minimal increase in base costs. The provision for loan losses was $15.9 million in first quarter 2003 compared to $15.4 million in first quarter of last year primarily due to the continued impact on our customer base of an ongoing economic period of slow growth. (Further discussion of asset quality trends is included in the Asset Quality section below.) Going forward the level of provision for loan losses should fluctuate primarily with the strength or weakness of the Tennessee economy. Going forward, in the near-term, net interest margin should decline further as term assets continue to reprice to lower rates (see A-11 for first quarter margin). Over the long-term, FTNC's relatively neutral balance sheet position should allow the net interest margin to stabilize after the effect of this repricing has occurred. Fee income from trust services and investment management should increase if the equity market improves and should decrease if the equity market experiences further declines. FTN Financial Pre-tax income for FTN Financial increased 19 percent to $46.3 million for first quarter 2003, compared to $38.9 million for first quarter 2002. Total revenues were $151.0 million, an increase of 37 percent from $109.9 million in 2002. Fee income increased 40 percent to $141.9 million in 2003. This increased revenue reflects continued growth and penetration into FTN Financial's targeted institutional customer base through expanded products and services. Revenue growth has also been influenced by the increased liquidity that capital markets' depository customers have experienced, as well as continued growth in the capital markets' non-depository account base. FTN Financial's enhanced institutional product and service lines, which include investment banking, equity research and sales, correspondent services and portfolio advisory services, remained relatively flat compared to 2002. Noninterest expense increased 46 percent in 2003 to $105.0 million compared to $71.8 million in 2002. This growth was primarily due to an increase of 44 percent in personnel expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, resulting from commissions and incentives associated with the higher fee income this year. Going forward, revenues will fluctuate based on factors which include the expansion of the customer base, the volume of investment banking transactions and the introduction of new products, as well as the strength of loan growth in the U.S. economy and volatility in the interest rate environment and the equity markets. Transaction Processing Pre-tax income for Transaction Processing decreased 28 percent to $4.3 million in 2003, compared to $5.9 million in 2002. Total revenues were $29.8 million, an increase of 6 percent from $28.2 million in 2002. The volume of merchant transactions processed grew 27 percent over first quarter 2002. Both revenue and expense levels were influenced by recent acquisitions. Corporate The Corporate segment's results showed a pre-tax loss of $23.4 million for 2003, compared to a loss of $19.8 million in 2002. In first quarter 2003, $12.4 million of expense was recognized related to modifications in and funding of an old deferred compensation plan, primarily for retireees. This transaction will reduce future expense related to this plan. In first quarter 2002, $6.6 million of expense was related to a specific litigation matter. Asset Quality An analytical model based on historical loss experience adjusted for current events, trends and economic conditions is used by management to determine the amount of provision to be recognized and to assess the adequacy of the loan loss allowance. Total FTNC provision for loan losses increased to $27.4 million in 2003 compared to $25.9 million in 2002. This increase reflects the continued impact on our customer base of a ongoing economic period of slow growth. This negative impact was largely offset by improvement in asset quality of retail loans due to a change in risk profile, including the effects of whole-loan insurance being provided for a segment of the loan portfolio and the sale of the Money Center loans. Net charge-offs remained relatively flat at $27.3 million in 2003 compared to $27.9 million last year. Net charge-offs were impacted in first quarter 2003 by improvement in both the consumer and commercial loan portfolios. The effect of improvements in broad asset quality were largely offset by the substantial resolution of a credit loss related to a large real estate project and the impact of net charge-offs associated with the write-off of the discount from the transfer of certain higher risk residential real estate loans to held for sale. Nonperforming assets decreased to $78.4 million on March 31, 2003, from $89.8 million on March 31, 2002. The decline in nonperforming assets is primarily due to improvements made in the disposition of repurchased mortgage loans. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans decreased to 1.21 percent on March 31, 2003, compared to 1.44 percent on March 31, 2002, primarily reflecting improvement in the retail loan portfolio's risk profile, including the effects of the whole loan insurance, the sale of the Money Center loans and the transfer of certain loans to held for sale. (See the table on A-9 for an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and details on nonperforming assets and the table on A-10 for asset quality ratios). Average Balance Sheet Total FTNC average assets increased 17 percent to $23.3 billion in 2003. Total loans increased 12 percent to $11.5 billion. Mortgage loans held for sale increased 65 percent to $4.1 billion due to the increased origination volume. Interest-bearing core deposits decreased 1 percent in 2003 while total core deposits increased 10 percent and purchased funds increased 19 percent. Average shareholders' equity increased 16 percent in first quarter 2003. Other Information This press release contains forward-looking statements involving significant risks and uncertainties.

SFAS No. 133, which was adopted on January 1, 2001, establishes accounting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. It requires that changes in the instrument's fair value be recognized currently in earnings (or other comprehensive income). If certain criteria are met, changes in the fair value of the asset or liability being hedged are also recognized currently in earnings. Fair value is determined on the last business day of a reporting period. This point in time measurement of derivative fair values and the related hedged item fair values may be well suited to the measurement of hedge effectiveness, as well as reported earnings, when hedge time horizons are short. The same measurement however may not consistently reflect the effectiveness of longer-term hedges and, in FTNC's view, can distort short-term measures of reported earnings. FTNC uses a combination of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain components of the interest rate risk associated with its portfolio of capitalized mortgage servicing rights, which currently have an average life of approximately three to four years. Over this long-term time horizon this combination of derivatives can be effective in significantly mitigating the effects of interest rate changes on the value of the servicing portfolio. However, these derivative financial instruments can and do demonstrate significant price volatility depending upon prevailing conditions in the financial markets. If a reporting period ends during a period of volatile financial market conditions, the effect of such point in time conditions on reported earnings does not reflect the underlying economics of the transactions or the true value of the hedges to FTNC over their estimated lives. The fact that the fair value of a particular derivative is unusually low or high on the last day of the reporting period is meaningful in evaluating performance during the period only if FTNC sells the derivative within the period of time before fair value changes and does not replace the hedge coverage with another derivative. FTNC believes the effect of such volatility on such short-term measures of earnings is not indicative of the expected long-term performance of this hedging practice. For its internal evaluation of performance for an applicable period, FTNC reclassifies select components of SFAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness from the reported net income of the First Horizon segment to the Corporate segment. The internal evaluation of First Horizon's long-term performance will include the long-term trend, if any, in these select components of SFAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness.
