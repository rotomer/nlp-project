Exhibit 99.1 FTNC Reports 31 Percent Growth with Earnings of $118.4 Million for Second Quarter 2003 MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 17, 2003--First Tennessee National Corporation (NYSE: FTN) (FTNC) announced today earnings for second quarter 2003 of $118.4 million, or $.90 diluted earnings per share, compared with last year's earnings of $90.4 million, or $.69 diluted earnings per share. This represents 31 percent growth from second quarter 2002 earnings. Return on average shareholders' equity and return on average assets for second quarter 2003 were 26.5 percent and 1.89 percent, respectively, and were 23.7 percent and 1.87 percent for second quarter 2002, respectively. Total assets were $27.9 billion, shareholders' equity was $1.8 billion and market capitalization was $5.6 billion on June 30, 2003, compared to $19.8 billion, $1.6 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, on June 30, 2002. For the first six months of 2003, earnings totaled $237.4 million or $1.81 diluted earnings per share. For the same period in 2002, earnings were $177.5 million or $1.36 diluted earnings per share. Return on average shareholders' equity was 27.1 percent and return on average assets was 1.98 percent for the first six months of 2003 compared to 23.7 percent and 1.82 percent, respectively, for the first six months of 2002. "Our business-mix balance continues to produce industry-leading growth and returns. This record of growth was produced at the same time we were making investments that will improve our ability to maintain high performing results as the economic climate changes," said President and CEO Ken Glass. "At the current level of earnings and with the expectation for a continuation of low interest rates and a strong housing market, the First Call consensus estimate continues to discount our earnings potential." First Horizon's national businesses achieved their third best quarter of earnings while producing $15.3 billion in home loan originations and continuing successful cross-sell efforts. First Horizon capitalized on the strength of the housing market as well as the current refinancing activity through continued expansion of the sales force and efficient back office operations. Additionally, FTN Financial achieved record earnings with a strengthened platform of products and services and expansion of the customer base. Due to the exceptional earnings, this quarter's expenses throughout FTNC include investments in initiatives promoting expense efficiencies and enhancing revenue growth. As expected in this current low interest rate environment, First Tennessee Banking Group's revenues were impacted by compression in the net interest margin. Total revenues increased 46 percent in second quarter 2003 to $748.5 million compared to $513.7 million in second quarter 2002. Noninterest income provides the majority of FTNC's revenue and contributed 73 percent to total revenue in second quarter 2003 compared to 66 percent in second quarter 2002. Second quarter 2003 noninterest income increased 63 percent to $548.7 million from $336.6 million in 2002. Noninterest expense increased 55 percent to $549.3 million from $354.6 million in 2002. Contributing to this increase was a $9.8 million contribution made to the First Tennessee Foundation, a non-profit entity dedicated to supporting charitable causes in the diverse communities where FTNC does business. The effective tax rate decreased to 31.0 percent for second quarter 2003 compared to 33.4 percent for the same period in 2002. This decline reflects a decrease of $6.2 million, or $9.8 million on a pre-tax equivalent basis, related to the settlement of prior years' tax returns. For the first six months of 2003, total revenues were $1,460.0 million, an increase of 43 percent from 2002. Noninterest income for the sixth-month period was $1,066.8 million and contributed 73 percent to total revenue as compared to $661.5 million, or 65 percent of total revenues, in 2002. Noninterest expense for the six months was $1,051.8 million in 2003 compared to $707.3 million in 2002. A more detailed discussion by segment follows. Business Segments First Horizon Pre-tax income for First Horizon increased 149 percent to $110.4 million for second quarter 2003, compared to $44.3 million for second quarter 2002. Total revenues were $365.4 million in second quarter 2003, an increase of 96 percent from $186.0 million in 2002. Net interest income increased 78 percent to $86.0 million in 2003 from $48.1 million. Net interest income in First Horizon Equity Lending increased $7.2 million primarily due to an increase of 132 percent in home equity lines of credit, which averaged $1.9 billion in second quarter 2003 compared to $.8 billion in 2002. The remaining increase of $30.7 million in net interest income reflects the impact of a larger portfolio of loans held for sale (warehouse), which grew 156 percent on average to $5.2 billion from $2.0 billion in second quarter 2002. Net interest spread on the warehouse, however, was negatively impacted by lower mortgage rates. Noninterest income increased 103 percent to $279.4 million in 2003 compared to $137.9 million in 2002. Noninterest income consists primarily of mortgage banking-related fees from the origination process, fees from mortgage servicing and mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net hedge gains or losses. Total noninterest income is net of amortization, impairment and other expenses related to MSR and related hedges. Loan origination volumes increased 177 percent in 2003 to $15.3 billion. In addition, loans securitized and sold into the secondary market increased 171 percent to $14.1 billion. Driven by low mortgage interest rates, refinance activity represented 76 percent of total originations during second quarter 2003 compared to 47 percent in second quarter 2002. Home purchase related originations grew 26 percent in 2003, demonstrating First Horizon's success in penetrating the purchase market. Due to the more stable nature of this market, which is not as vulnerable to interest rates, First Horizon's access to the purchase market should help support production levels when mortgage rates rise. Fees from the origination process increased 149 percent to $293.0 million compared to $117.5 million in 2002. This increase reflects growth in origination fees, in revenue recognized on loans sold, in the value recognized on loans in process, and higher net secondary marketing trading gains, which were influenced by the favorable interest rate environment experienced during the year. The mortgage-servicing portfolio was $64.0 billion on June 30, 2003, an increase of 31 percent compared to $48.7 billion on June 30, 2002. The sustained growth of this asset in a period of historically high prepayment levels was made possible, in part, by the recapture of refinances from the existing servicing portfolio. Servicing fees increased 17 percent as a result of this increase in the servicing portfolio. However, total fees associated with mortgage servicing decreased 1 percent to $43.0 million in second quarter 2003 due to the unfavorable impact of early payoff interest expense. MSR amortization was $32.6 million in second quarter 2003 compared with $29.9 million in second quarter 2002. In 2003 there was a MSR impairment loss of $72.3 million compared to a $24.9 million loss in 2002. Net MSR hedging gains (including the effect of time decay) were $38.3 million in 2003 compared to $23.7 million net gains in 2002. The interest rate environment in 2003 impacted increased net hedge gains and increased MSR amortization and impairment losses. The provision for loan losses was $7.8 million in 2003 compared to $9.3 million in 2002. The decreased provision reflects the impact of improvements in the risk profile of the retail loan portfolio due to the sale of Money Center loans in 2002, certain classified and nonperforming loans being transferred to available for sale and whole-loan insurance being provided for a segment of the retail loan portfolio. Noninterest expense increased 87 percent in 2003 to $247.2 million compared to $132.4 million in 2002. The growth was primarily the result of an increase of 109 percent in personnel expense resulting from higher commission expense related to the increased mortgage origination volume produced during 2003. For the first six months of 2003, pre-tax income increased 168 percent to $229.6 from $85.5 million in 2002. Total revenues for the six-month period were $717.3 million, an increase of 95 percent from $368.2 million in 2002. Total noninterest expense for the six-month period increased 79 percent to $468.1 million from $262.1 million in 2002 for the same reasons discussed earlier. Going forward, the existing level of loans in process (pipeline) due to an as yet unabated surge in applications currently indicates a continuation of record origination levels. Excluding the impact of the pipeline, fee income from refinance loan originations will generally depend on mortgage interest rates. An increase in rates should reduce origination fees and profit from the sale of loans, but should also reduce MSR amortization expense and impairment losses, while a decrease in rates should increase this net revenue. Flat to rising interest rates should reduce net secondary marketing trading gains, while falling rates should increase this net revenue. If total origination volume increases and/or the yield curve steepens, net interest income from the warehouse should increase, while if volume decreases and/or the yield curve flattens, this revenue should decrease. Continued success in our national cross-sell strategies should increase revenues from products other than traditional mortgage origination and servicing. First Tennessee Banking Group Pre-tax income for First Tennessee Banking Group (previously referred to as FTN Banking Group) decreased 59 percent to $26.1 million in second quarter 2003, compared to $63.4 million for the same period in 2002. Total revenues for the segment were $177.3 million, a decrease of 7 percent from $191.5 million in second quarter 2002. Net interest income decreased 16 percent to $96.9 million from $116.0 million in 2002. The decline in net interest income was related to compression in the net interest margin primarily due to the repricing of assets to lower yields while liability rates have become less sensitive to rate movements in this historically low interest rate environment and due to a change in the mix of the loan portfolio to floating rate products. Noninterest income increased 7 percent to $80.4 million compared to $75.5 million in 2002. This increase was due to improvement in insurance revenue, higher deposit account service charges , and growth in cash management fees. The positive impact of these items was partially offset by a decrease in trust and investment management fees. Noninterest expense increased 16 percent in 2003 to $132.0 million from $114.2 million last year. Contributing to this increase were expenses associated with initiatives focused on generating future earnings including marketing programs, severance and professional fees. The provision for loan losses was $19.2 million in second quarter 2003 compared to $13.9 million in second quarter of last year primarily due to an increase in historical loss factors on commercial loans used in the allowance model and due to loan growth. (Further discussion of asset quality trends is included in the Asset Quality section below.) Going forward the level of provision for loan losses should fluctuate primarily with the strength or weakness of the Tennessee economy. For the first six months of 2003, pre-tax income decreased 52 percent to $61.7 million from $128.3 million in 2002. Total revenues for the sixth-month period were $354.9 million, a decrease of 7 percent from $383.2 million in 2002. Total noninterest expense for the sixth-month period increased 14 percent to $258.1 million from $225.6 for the same period in 2002. FTN Financial Pre-tax income for FTN Financial increased 52 percent to a record $52.5 million for second quarter 2003, compared to $34.5 million for second quarter 2002. Total revenues were a record level of $171.7 million, an increase of 59 percent from $108.1 million in second quarter 2002. Fee income increased 61 percent to $161.1 million in 2003. This increased revenue reflects continued growth and penetration into FTN Financial's targeted institutional customer base through strengthened product and service lines. Revenue growth has also been influenced by the increased liquidity that capital markets' depository customers have experienced, as well as continued growth in the capital markets' non-depository account base. FTN Financial's enhanced institutional product and service lines, which include investment banking, equity research and sales, correspondent services and portfolio advisory services, increased 36 percent compared to 2002. Noninterest expense increased 61 percent in second quarter 2003 to $118.6 million compared to $73.5 million for the same period last year. This growth was primarily due to an increase of 64 percent in personnel expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, resulting from commissions and incentives associated with the higher fee income this year. For the first six months of 2003, pre-tax income increased 35 percent to $98.8 million from $73.4 million in 2002. Total revenues for the period were $322.7 million, an increase of 48 percent from $218.0 million in 2002. Total noninterest expense for the six-month period increased 54 percent to $223.6 million from $145.3 million in 2002. Going forward, revenues will fluctuate based on factors which include the expansion or contraction of the customer base, the volume of investment banking transactions and the introduction of new products, as well as the strength of loan growth in the U.S. economy and volatility in the interest rate environment and the equity markets. Transaction Processing Pre-tax income for Transaction Processing decreased 11 percent to $5.0 million in 2003, compared to $5.7 million in 2002. Total revenues were $31.3 million, an increase of 2 percent from $30.8 million in 2002. The volume of merchant transactions processed grew 20 percent over second quarter 2002. Both revenue and expense levels were influenced by recent acquisitions. For the first six months of 2003, pre-tax income decreased 20 percent to $9.3 million from $11.6 million in 2002. Corporate The Corporate segment's results showed a pre-tax loss of $22.2 million in second quarter 2003, compared to a loss of $11.7 million in second quarter 2002. Included in the pre-tax loss for 2003 is the $9.8 million contribution made to First Tennessee Foundation, a non-profit entity dedicated to supporting charitable causes in the communities where FTNC does business. FTNC has made contributions to the Foundation in three of the last four quarters. These contributions, which are discretionary, have been made and may continue to be made when a favorable economic environment or other favorable factor (such as the second quarter tax settlement discussed above) enables FTNC to produce strong earnings. They should have the effect of reducing noninterest expense in future periods because the Foundation's contributions are likely to reduce FTNC's direct charitable contributions. Asset Quality An analytical model based on historical loss experience adjusted for current events, trends and economic conditions is used by management to determine the amount of provision to be recognized and to assess the adequacy of the loan loss allowance. Total FTNC provision for loan losses increased to $27.6 million in second quarter 2003 compared to $23.3 million in second quarter 2002. This increase is primarily due to higher historical loss factors on commercial loans, resulting from the impact an extended period of slow economic growth has had on our customer base, coupled with rapid growth in retail loans. These negative impacts were partially offset by improvement in asset quality of retail loans due to a change in risk profile, including the effects of whole-loan insurance being provided for a segment of the loan portfolio and the sale of the Money Center loans. Net charge-offs decreased to $12.9 million in second quarter 2003 compared to $24.5 million last year. Net charge-offs were impacted in second quarter 2003 by improvement in both the consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Nonperforming assets remained flat at $83.1 million on June 30, 2003, compared to $81.1 million on June 30, 2002. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans decreased to 1.25 percent on June 30, 2003, compared to 1.40 percent on June 30, 2002, primarily reflecting improvement in the retail loan portfolio's risk profile, including the effects of the whole loan insurance, the sale of the Money Center loans and the transfer of certain loans to held for sale. (See the table on A-12 for an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and details on nonperforming assets and the table on A-13 for asset quality ratios). Average Balance Sheet Total FTNC average assets increased 29 percent in second quarter 2003 to $25.1 billion. Total loans increased 18 percent to $12.3 billion. Loans held for sale increased 155 percent to $5.2 billion due to the increased origination volume. Interest-bearing core deposits decreased 1 percent in 2003 while total core deposits increased 16 percent and purchased funds increased 40 percent. Average shareholders' equity increased 17 percent in second quarter 2003. The consolidated margin decreased to 3.72 percent for second quarter 2003 compared to 4.36 percent for the same period in 2002 primarily due to the repricing of assets to lower yields while liability rates have become less sensitive to rate movements in this historically low interest rate environment and due to a change in the mix of the loan portfolio to floating rate products. Going forward, in the near-term, net interest margin should decline further as term assets continue to reprice to lower rates (see A-14 for second quarter margin). The adoption of SFAS No. 150 in third quarter 2003 will also result in further compression of the consolidated net interest margin. Historically, the expense associated with FTNC's trust preferred and REIT preferred stock have been classified as noninterest expense, but upon adoption of SFAS No. 150 will be classified as interest expense on a prospective basis. Over the long-term, FTNC's asset sensitive balance sheet position should allow the net interest margin to improve when interest rates begin to rise.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) Corporate includes certain corporate expenses, interest expense on trust preferred and REIT preferred stock, select components of SFAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness and other items not allocated or not specifically assigned to business segments. A-16 FIRST TENNESSEE NATIONAL CORPORATION SFAS No. 133 HIGHLIGHTS (Unaudited) FTNC uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge or protect the value of certain assets and liabilities recorded on its balance sheet from changes in interest rates. SFAS No. 133, which was adopted on January 1, 2001, establishes accounting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. It requires that changes in the instrument's fair value be recognized currently in earnings (or other comprehensive income). If certain criteria are met, changes in the fair value of the asset or liability being hedged are also recognized currently in earnings. Fair value is determined on the last business day of a reporting period. This point in time measurement of derivative fair values and the related hedged item fair values may be well suited to the measurement of hedge effectiveness, as well as reported earnings, when hedge time horizons are short. The same measurement however may not consistently reflect the effectiveness of longer-term hedges and, in FTNC's view, can distort short-term measures of reported earnings. FTNC uses a combination of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain components of the interest rate risk associated with its portfolio of capitalized mortgage servicing rights, which currently have an average life of approximately three to four years. Over this long-term time horizon this combination of derivatives can be effective in significantly mitigating the effects of interest rate changes on the value of the servicing portfolio. However, these derivative financial instruments can and do demonstrate significant price volatility depending upon prevailing conditions in the financial markets. If a reporting period ends during a period of volatile financial market conditions, the effect of such point in time conditions on reported earnings does not reflect the underlying economics of the transactions or the true value of the hedges to FTNC over their estimated lives. The fact that the fair value of a particular derivative is unusually low or high on the last day of the reporting period is meaningful in evaluating performance during the period only if FTNC sells the derivative within the period of time before fair value changes and does not replace the hedge coverage with another derivative. FTNC believes the effect of such volatility on such short-term measures of earnings is not indicative of the expected long-term performance of this hedging practice. For its internal evaluation of performance for an applicable period, FTNC reclassifies select components of SFAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness from the reported net income of the First Horizon segment to the Corporate segment. The internal evaluation of First Horizon's long-term performance will include the long-term trend, if any, in these select components of SFAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness.
