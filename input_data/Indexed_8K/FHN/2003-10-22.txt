Exhibit 99.1 FTN Reports Record Third Quarter Earnings, A 33 Percent Increase in the Quarterly Dividend, a New Chairman of the Board, and Other Board Appointments MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2003--First Tennessee National Corporation (FTNC)(NYSE:FTN) announced today earnings for third quarter 2003 of $118.3 million, or $.91 diluted earnings per share, compared with last year's earnings of $95.6 million, or $.73 diluted earnings per share. This represents 25 percent growth from third quarter 2002 earnings per share. Return on average shareholders' equity and return on average assets for third quarter 2003 were 25.9 percent and 1.71 percent, respectively, and were 23.8 percent and 1.84 percent for third quarter 2002, respectively. Total assets were $25.5 billion, shareholders' equity was $1.9 billion and market capitalization was $5.4 billion on September 30, 2003, compared to $22.7 billion, $1.6 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, on September 30, 2002. For the first nine months of 2003, earnings totaled $355.7 million or $2.72 diluted earnings per share. For the same period in 2002, earnings were $273.1 million or $2.09 diluted earnings per share. Return on average shareholders' equity was 26.7 percent and return on average assets was 1.88 percent for the first nine months of 2003 compared to 23.7 percent and 1.83 percent, respectively, for the first nine months of 2002. "This record third quarter continues us on a course which should culminate in our third consecutive year of industry leading growth in excess of 20 percent," said President and CEO Ken Glass. "I'm especially pleased with First Horizon's ability to manage through this quarter's extremely volatile interest rate environment. Once again we were able to take advantage of our strong performance by making investments in initiatives that should help sustain our excellent record of growth into next year and beyond." Total revenues increased 27 percent in third quarter 2003 to $736.4 million compared to $580.7 million in third quarter 2002. Noninterest income provides the majority of FTNC's revenue and contributed 71 percent to total revenue in third quarter 2003 compared to 68 percent in third quarter 2002. Third quarter 2003 noninterest income increased 34 percent to $525.5 million from $392.0 million in 2002. Noninterest expense increased 28 percent to $539.9 million from $421.4 million in 2002. Included in this increase were investments in initiatives that will enhance FTNC's ability to remain a high-performing financial services company. These investments included costs associated with management's initiatives to develop an infrastructure to support business expansion. This included enhancements to business processes such as the design of computer systems and workflow that provide added flexibility and increased management information support. In tandem with these investments, management has implemented programs to curtail costs including restructuring debt and consolidating consumer-lending functions in First Horizon. Additionally, expenditures were made in a non-management performance bonus award to build employee value and increased advertising cost in order to enhance market perception and customer acquisition, especially in the Middle Tennessee marketplace. The effective tax rate increased to 34.4 percent for third quarter 2003 compared to 31.3 percent for the same period in 2002. Third quarter 2002's expense reflected a $3.7 million benefit resulting from a change in the tax status of a subsidiary of First Tennessee Bank National Association which had a one-time effect on 2002 in the third and fourth quarters. For the first nine months of 2003, total revenues were $2,196.4 million, an increase of 37 percent from 2002. Noninterest income for the nine-month period was $1,592.3 million and contributed 72 percent to total revenue as compared to $1,053.5 million, or 66 percent, of total revenue in 2002. Noninterest expense for the nine months was $1,591.7 million in 2003 compared to $1,128.7 million in 2002. A more detailed discussion by segment follows. Business Segments First Horizon Pre-tax income for First Horizon increased 97 percent to $115.3 million for third quarter 2003, compared to $58.6 million for third quarter 2002. Total revenues were $387.8 million in third quarter 2003, an increase of 70 percent from $228.3 million in 2002. Net interest income increased 61 percent to $99.9 million in 2003 from $62.0 million. Net interest income in First Horizon Equity Lending increased $9.7 million primarily due to an increase of 109 percent in home equity lines of credit, which averaged $2.3 billion in third quarter 2003 compared to $1.1 billion in 2002. The remaining increase of $28.2 million in net interest income reflects the impact of a larger portfolio of loans held for sale (warehouse), which grew 90 percent on average to $5.7 billion from $3.0 billion in third quarter 2002. Net interest spread on the warehouse, however, was negatively impacted by lower mortgage rates compared to third quarter 2002. Noninterest income increased 73 percent to $287.9 million in 2003 compared to $166.3 million in 2002. Noninterest income consists primarily of mortgage banking-related fees from the origination process, fees from mortgage servicing and mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net hedge gains or losses. Total noninterest income is net of amortization, impairment and other expenses related to MSR and related hedges. Loan origination volumes increased 59 percent in third quarter 2003 to $14.6 billion. However, due to the large overhang of $5.9 billion of mortgage loans held for sale on June 30, 2003, loans securitized and sold into the secondary market increased 133 percent to $17.4 billion. Fees from the origination process (generally driven by either origination volumes or loans securitized and sold) increased 81 percent to $299.5 million compared to $165.7 million in 2002. Driven by low mortgage interest rates, refinance activity represented 72 percent of total originations during third quarter 2003 compared to 66 percent in third quarter 2002. Home purchase related originations grew 29 percent in 2003, demonstrating First Horizon's success in penetrating the purchase market. First Horizon's access to the purchase market should help production levels as mortgage rates rise. The mortgage-servicing portfolio was $67.6 billion on September 30, 2003, an increase of 30 percent compared to $52.1 billion on September 30, 2002. The sustained growth of this asset in a period of high prepayment levels was made possible, in part, by the recapture of refinances from the existing servicing portfolio. Servicing fees increased 23 percent as a result of this increase in the servicing portfolio. However, total fees associated with mortgage servicing increased only 6 percent due to the unfavorable impact of early payoffs. MSR amortization was $33.5 million in third quarter 2003 compared with $28.2 million in third quarter 2002. In 2003 there was a MSR impairment loss of $47.8 million compared to a $42.5 million loss in 2002. Net MSR hedging gains (including the effect of time decay and excluding SFAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness which is included in the Corporate segment - see also A-17) were $20.5 million in 2003 compared to $18.0 million net gains in 2002. The interest rate environment in 2003 impacted increased net hedge gains and increased MSR amortization and impairment losses. The provision for loan losses was $7.1 million in 2003 compared to $4.3 million in 2002. 2002 included a $7.4 million reduction in provision resulting from a change in risk profile due to the sale of Money Center loans. This improvement in asset quality is related to strengthening customer demographics and a positive shift in the mix of the loan portfolio. Noninterest expense increased 60 percent in 2003 to $265.4 million compared to $165.4 million in 2002. The growth was primarily the result of an increase of 79 percent in personnel expense resulting from higher commission expense related to the increased mortgage origination volume produced during 2003. For the first nine months of 2003, pre-tax income increased 139 percent to $344.9 from $144.1 million in 2002. Total revenues for the nine-month period were $1,105.1 million, an increase of 85 percent from $596.5 million in 2002. Total noninterest expense for the nine-month period increased 72 percent to $733.5 million from $427.5 million in 2002 for the same reasons discussed earlier. Going forward, fee income from refinance loan originations will generally depend on mortgage interest rates. Over time, an increase in rates should reduce origination fees and profit from the sale of loans, but should also reduce MSR amortization expense and impairment losses, while a decrease in rates should increase this net revenue. Flat to rising interest rates should reduce net secondary marketing trading gains, while falling rates should increase this net revenue. If total origination volume increases and/or the yield curve steepens, net interest income from the warehouse should increase, while if volume decreases and/or the yield curve flattens, this revenue should decrease. In third quarter 2003, mortgage interest rates began to rise from recent historically low levels, and refinance origination volumes are expected to decline in fourth quarter. Continued success in our national cross-sell strategies should increase revenues from products other than traditional mortgage origination and servicing. First Tennessee Banking Group Pre-tax income for First Tennessee Banking Group (previously referred to as FTN Banking Group) decreased 14 percent to $46.9 million in third quarter 2003, compared to $54.6 million for the same period in 2002. This decline was driven by a $13.4 million drop in net interest income; however, balance sheet leveraging capacity which is normally used within First Tennessee Banking Group has been employed by the First Horizon segment as the growth in the mortgage warehouse produced $28.2 million net interest income growth over last year. Total revenues for the segment were $184.4 million, a decrease of 1 percent from $185.6 million in third quarter 2002. Net interest income decreased 12 percent to $98.3 million from $111.7 million in 2002. The decline in net interest income was related to compression in the net interest margin primarily due to the repricing of assets to lower yields while liability rates have become less sensitive to rate movements in this historically low interest rate environment and due to a change in the mix of the loan portfolio to floating rate products. Investment yields have declined as accelerated prepayments of investments in mortgage-backed securities have resulted in increased amortization of premiums in addition to the effect of proceeds from these prepaid investments being reinvested at lower rates. Noninterest income increased 16 percent to $86.1 million compared to $73.9 million in 2002. This increase was due, in part, to improvements in insurance revenue and trust and investment management fees. Also impacting this increase were net securities gains of $4.2 million in third quarter 2003. Included in this amount were net gains of $10.1 million from FTNC's wholly owned venture capital subsidiary, Hickory Venture Capital Corporation, primarily resulting from the sale of a venture capital investment and net losses of $5.9 million primarily resulting from sales of lower-yielding securities in the investment portfolio. Noninterest expense increased 12 percent in 2003 to $129.4 million from $115.9 million last year. Contributing to this increase were higher personnel costs primarily related to growth in Synaxis, a wholly owned insurance broker, incentives associated with the sale of a venture capital investment and increased benefit costs. Also impacting expense growth were litigation costs and initiatives promoting expense efficiencies and enhancing revenue growth. The provision for loan losses was $8.1 million in third quarter 2003 compared to $15.1 million in third quarter 2002 primarily due to improvement in specific allocations related to large commercial credits. (Further discussion of asset quality trends is included in the Asset Quality section below.) Going forward the level of provision for loan losses should fluctuate primarily with the strength or weakness of the Tennessee economy. For the first nine months of 2003, pre-tax income decreased 41 percent to $108.6 million from $182.9 million in 2002. Total revenues for the nine-month period were $539.3 million, a decrease of 5 percent from $568.8 million in 2002. Total noninterest expense for the nine-month period increased 13 percent to $387.5 million from $341.5 for the same period in 2002. FTN Financial Pre-tax income for FTN Financial was $42.2 million for third quarter 2003 compared to $42.9 million for third quarter 2002. Total revenues increased 1 percent to $135.4 million from $134.6 million in third quarter 2002. Fee income was $124.7 million in 2003 compared to $125.7 million in 2002. Revenues from fixed income products were lower, primarily due to the impact this quarter's market volatility had on delaying customers' purchasing decisions. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues in lending through correspondent services and other revenues, which include investment banking, equity research and sales, and portfolio advisory services. Capital market business with depositories and non-depository customers decreased 4 percent and represented 39 percent and 22 percent of revenue, respectively. Other revenue sources increased 9 percent and contributed to 39 percent of revenue. Noninterest expense increased 1 percent in third quarter 2003 to $92.1 million compared to $90.9 million for the same period last year. For the first nine months of 2003, pre-tax income increased 21 percent to $141.0 million from $116.3 million in 2002. Total revenues for the period were $458.1 million, an increase of 30 percent from $352.6 million in 2002. Total noninterest expense for the nine-month period increased 34 percent to $315.7 million from $236.2 million in 2002. Going forward, revenues will fluctuate based on factors which include the expansion or contraction of the customer base, the volume of investment banking transactions and the introduction of new products, as well as the strength of loan growth in the U.S. economy and volatility in the interest rate environment and the equity markets. Transaction Processing Pre-tax income for Transaction Processing decreased 33 percent to $3.8 million in 2003, compared to $5.7 million in 2002 primarily due to a drop in express processing transactions. Express processing revenues decreased 8 percent as the volume of transactions processed for customers declined 11 percent compared to third quarter 2002. On the other hand, the volume of merchant transactions processed grew 12 percent over third quarter 2002 creating growth in merchant revenues of 15 percent. These increases were primarily due to recent acquisitions and some recovery in the hospitality industry. For the first nine months of 2003, pre-tax income decreased 24 percent to $13.1 million from $17.3 million in 2002. Corporate The Corporate segment's results showed a pre-tax loss of $27.6 million in third quarter 2003, compared to a loss of $22.4 million in third quarter 2002. 2003's pre-tax loss included costs of $8.7 million associated with management's initiatives to develop an infrastructure to support business expansion. This included enhancements to business processes such as the design of computer systems and workflow that provide added flexibility and increased management information support. In tandem with these investments, management has implemented programs to curtail costs including restructuring debt which resulted in a loss of $5.8 million in third quarter 2003. Additionally, expenditures of $2.8 million were made in a non-management performance bonus award to build employee value. Included in the pre-tax loss for third quarter 2002 is a $13.0 million contribution to First Tennessee Foundation, a non-profit entity dedicated to supporting charitable causes in the diverse communities where FTNC does business. Asset Quality Net charge-offs decreased to $14.0 million in third quarter 2003 compared to $23.8 million last year. Net charge-offs were impacted in third quarter 2003 by improvement in both the consumer and commercial loan portfolios, and third quarter 2002 net charge-offs included $2.4 million related to the sale of Money Center loans. Nonperforming assets decreased to $84.2 million on September 30, 2003, compared to $91.9 million on September 30, 2002. As a result of improvement in asset quality, total FTNC provision for loan losses decreased to $16.3 million in third quarter 2003 compared to $20.2 million in third quarter 2002 which included the $7.4 million reduction in provision resulting from a change in risk profile due to the sale of Money Center loans. The decrease in provision is primarily due to improvement in specific allocations related to large commercial credits, a change in the mix of the retail loan portfolio to loans with lower risk factors, and the effect of providing whole-loan insurance for a segment of the loan portfolio. An analytical model based on historical loss experience adjusted for current events, trends and economic conditions is used by management to determine the amount of provision to be recognized and to assess the adequacy of the loan loss allowance. (See the table on A-12 for an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and details on nonperforming assets and the table on A-13 for asset quality ratios). Average Balance Sheet Total FTNC average assets increased 33 percent in third quarter 2003 to $27.4 billion. Total loans increased 21 percent to $13.0 billion. Loans held for sale increased 90 percent to $5.7 billion due to the increased origination volume. Interest-bearing core deposits increased 1 percent in 2003 while total core deposits increased 18 percent and purchased funds increased 40 percent. Average shareholders' equity increased 14 percent in third quarter 2003. The consolidated net interest margin decreased to 3.63 percent for third quarter 2003 compared to 4.34 percent for the same period in 2002 primarily due to the repricing of assets to lower yields while liability rates have become less sensitive to rate movements in this historically low interest rate environment and due to a change in the mix of the loan portfolio to a higher percentage of floating rate products. Investment yields have declined as accelerated prepayments of investments in mortgage-backed securities resulted in increased amortization of premiums in addition to the effect of proceeds from these prepaid investments being reinvested at lower rates. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 in third quarter 2003 further compressed the consolidated net interest margin by five basis points. Historically, the expense associated with FTNC's trust preferred and REIT preferred stock was classified as noninterest expense, but upon adoption of SFAS No. 150 is now classified as interest expense on a prospective basis. In the near-term, a recent decline in prepayment volume and a slowdown in the repricing of the commercial and retail loan portfolios coupled with steps management has taken to manage the interest rate sensitivity position of the company should result in a more stable net interest margin (see A-14 for third quarter margin). Over the long-term, FTNC's strategies to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet position should allow the net interest margin to remain stable when interest rates rise. BOARD OF DIRECTORS' ACTIONS At its quarterly meeting the board of directors approved payment of the 429th consecutive quarterly dividend of $.40 per share of common stock. This represents an increase of 33 percent, reflecting management's confidence in the ability of the company to continue to produce high-performing results. This keeps FTNC within its stated dividend payout range of between 35 percent and 40 percent of earnings per share. Over a three-year period, FTNC has increased its dividend by 82 percent. The dividend is payable on January 1, 2004, to shareholders of record on December 12, 2003. Additionally, the board announced that Ralph Horn has selected early retirement as chairman of the board effective December 31, 2003, and as planned, Ken Glass will assume the chairmanship along with his current role as president and CEO, which he has held since July 2002. "We have been working on this transition for the last couple of years," said Horn. "This move is especially appropriate given the solid direction Ken has provided during our strong recent performance. Since taking over as CEO, Ken has done an outstanding job, and I have great confidence in his ability to lead us as we transition to a national financial services company." Glass, 57, joined FTNC in 1974 as corporate controller. He was named COO and president in 2001, before taking on the CEO's responsibilities last year. He earned his B.A. from Harding University and completed the Harvard Business School Advanced Management Program. Horn, 62, joined FTNC in 1963 as a management trainee in the capital markets group. He became president of the corporation in 1991, and was named CEO in 1994. He has been chairman of the board since January 1, 1996. In another action, the board appointed Mary Sammons a member of the board of directors of FTNC. Sammons is president and chief executive officer of Rite Aid Corporation. She is a member of Rite Aid's board of directors and is also chairperson of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. "Mary will be a valuable addition to our board, especially with her insight into the retailing industry," said Ralph Horn. The board also approved Marty Mosby as chief financial officer effective November 17, 2003, replacing Elbert L. (Eb) Thomas, Jr., who is recovering from recent surgery. Thomas will remain with the company as executive vice president and interest rate risk manager. James F. Keen, acting CFO for the past 11 months, will continue his responsibilities as corporate controller and principal accounting officer. "Eb Thomas has provided great service in his role of CFO of First Tennessee," said Glass. "We're extremely fortunate to have someone of his experience and expertise continuing with us in an executive capacity." Mosby, 40, joined FTNC in 1988 as a staff economist and asset/liability management analyst. He was senior vice president of investor relations and strategic planning before being named executive vice president of strategic planning and investor relations and chair of the executive risk management committee in 2001. He earned his B.A. from the University of Memphis and his M.A. at the University of Pennsylvania.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) Corporate includes certain corporate expenses, interest expense on trust preferred and REIT preferred stock, select components of SFAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness and other items not allocated or not specifically assigned to business segments. A-16 FIRST TENNESSEE NATIONAL CORPORATION SFAS No. 133 HIGHLIGHTS (Unaudited) FTNC uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge or protect the value of certain assets and liabilities recorded on its balance sheet from changes in interest rates. SFAS No. 133, which was adopted on January 1, 2002, establishes accounting requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. It requires that changes in the instrument's fair value be recognized currently in earnings (or other comprehensive income). If certain criteria are met, changes in the fair value of the asset or liability being hedged are also recognized currently in earnings. Fair value is determined on the last business day of a reporting period. This point in time measurement of derivative fair values and the related hedged item fair values may be well suited to the measurement of hedge effectiveness, as well as reported earnings, when hedge time horizons are short. The same measurement however may not consistently reflect the effectiveness of longer- term hedges and, in FTNC's view, can distort short-term measures of reported earnings. FTNC uses a combination of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain components of the interest rate risk associated with its portfolio of capitalized mortgage servicing rights, which currently have an average life of approximately three to four years. Over this long-term time horizon this combination of derivatives can be effective in significantly mitigating the effects of interest rate changes on the value of the servicing portfolio. However, these derivative financial instruments can and do demonstrate significant price volatility depending upon prevailing conditions in the financial markets. If a reporting period ends during a period of volatile financial market conditions, the effect of such point in time conditions on reported earnings does not reflect the underlying economics of the transactions or the true value of the hedges to FTNC over their estimated lives. The fact that the fair value of a particular derivative is unusually low or high on the last day of the reporting period is meaningful in evaluating performance during the period only if FTNC sells the derivative within the period of time before fair value changes and does not replace the hedge coverage with another derivative. FTNC believes the effect of such volatility on such short-term measures of earnings is not indicative of the expected long-term performance of this hedging practice. For its internal evaluation of performance for an applicable period, FTNC reclassifies select components of SFAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness from the reported net income of the First Horizon segment to the Corporate segment. The internal evaluation of First Horizon's long-term performance will include the long-term trend, if any, in these select components of SFAS 133 hedge ineffectiveness. A-17 FIRST TENNESSEE NATIONAL CORPORATION OTHER HIGHLIGHTS (Unaudited) Effective July 1, 2003, FTNC adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity", and classified its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary ($45.1 million on July 1, 2003) and guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in FTNC's junior subordinated debentures ($100.0 million on July 1, 2003) as term borrowings. As required by SFAS No. 150 prior periods were not restated, resulting in growth rates that do not reflect real increases or decreases in obligations. Excluding the impact of adopting SFAS No. 150 ($145.1 million in third quarter 2003) term borrowings increased 138 percent to $1.6 billion.
