Exhibit 99.1 FTNC Reports 26 Percent Growth for 2003 with Record Earnings of $473.3 Million MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--xx--First Tennessee National Corporation (FTNC) (NYSE:FTN) announced today record earnings of $473.3 million, or $3.62 diluted earnings per share for 2003. This represents 26 percent growth from 2002 earnings of $376.5 million, or $2.89 diluted earnings per share. "We are very pleased with the consistency of our earnings in 2003 given the dramatically different business environments in which we operated," said Chairman and CEO Ken Glass. "The first three quarters were heavily influenced by the refinance market and the fourth reflected a more balanced contribution from our three major business lines. This confirms the effectiveness of our countercyclical business mix and the positive effect of the considerable investments we've made over the last two years." Return on average shareholders' equity and return on average assets for 2003 were 26.3 percent and 1.88 percent, respectively in 2003 compared to 24.0 percent and 1.82 percent in 2002. Total assets were $24.5 billion, shareholders' equity was $1.9 billion and market capitalization was $5.6 billion on December 31, 2003, compared to $23.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, on December 31, 2002. During fourth quarter 2003 earnings totaled $117.6 million, or $.90 diluted earnings per share. This represents 14 percent growth from fourth quarter 2002 earnings of $103.4 million, or $.80 diluted earnings per share. Return on average shareholders' equity and return on average assets for fourth quarter 2003 were 25.2 percent and 1.89 percent, respectively, compared to 24.8 percent and 1.80 percent for fourth quarter 2002. Income Statement There were several factors in play behind the numbers during 2003 that had a significant impact on our ability to continue our excellent growth record. We were able to take advantage of the remaining opportunities in the mortgage refinance market, doubled our First Horizon sales force, got a strong effort from our construction lending business and experienced continued improvements in the cross-selling of consumer lending products. FTN Financial saw an increased demand for its improved product offerings, and our strategy to expand our banking presence in Middle Tennessee took root as we continued to grow our statewide market share advantage. During the peak of the refinance boom we naturally enjoyed a surge in origination revenues. And even though servicing profitability experienced significant impairment, we were still able to invest $90 million in initiatives designed to improve our future performance. As the business environment changed in the last half of 2003, our business mix rebalanced naturally, allowing earnings per share to remain relatively stable throughout the year. Following are discussions of each business segment. Under SFAS No. 91, certain nonrefundable fees associated with originating loans are deferred at the point they are incurred and generally are recognized over the life of the loan. In the case of mortgage loans sold, the deferred costs are recognized when the loan is sold. These loan origination costs have been classified as a component of the gain on the sale of the loans in this period and previously reported amounts have been reclassified to agree with the current presentation. First Horizon Pre-tax income for First Horizon increased 58 percent to $428.7 million for 2003, compared to $271.9 million for 2002. Total revenues were $974.7 million in 2003, an increase of 38 percent from $705.3 million in 2002. Noninterest income increased 39 percent to $639.3 million in 2003 compared to $460.6 million in 2002. Noninterest income consists primarily of mortgage banking-related revenue, net of costs, from the origination and sale of mortgage loans, fees from mortgage servicing and mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net hedge gains or losses. Total noninterest income is net of amortization, impairment and other expenses related to MSR and related hedges. Loan origination volumes in 2003 increased 45 percent to $47.8 billion. Contributing to the growth in origination activity were home purchase related originations of $13.5 billion which grew 24 percent from 2002, demonstrating First Horizon's success in accessing the purchase market and initiatives to grow the sales force. Heavily influenced by low mortgage interest rates, refinance activity represented 72 percent of total originations during 2003 compared to 67 percent last year. In addition, loans securitized and sold into the secondary market increased 60 percent to $49.6 billion. Net revenue from originating and selling mortgage loans (generally driven by either origination volumes or loans securitized and sold) increased 38 percent to $569.8 million compared to $413.6 million in 2002. The mortgage-servicing portfolio was $68.9 billion on December 31, 2003, an increase of 23 percent compared to $56.0 billion on December 31, 2002. Servicing fees increased 20 percent as a result of this increase in the servicing portfolio. Servicing fees were negatively impacted by a lower level of GNMA mortgages, which earn higher servicing fees. Total fees associated with mortgage servicing increased only 11 percent to $186.7 million due to the unfavorable impact of early payoffs. MSR amortization was $132.3 million for 2003 compared with $117.8 million in 2002. In 2003 there was a MSR impairment loss of $158.3 million compared to a $150.2 million loss in 2002. Net MSR hedging gains (including the effect of time decay) were $115.2 million in 2003 compared to $100.8 million net gains in 2002. The interest rate environment in 2003 impacted both increased net hedge gains and increased MSR amortization and impairment losses. The provision for loan losses was $33.4 million in 2003 compared to $27.3 million in 2002. The change in provision reflects an approximately $13 million increase resulting from a change in risk profile due to the sale of Money Center loans and from certain nonperforming and retail loans being transferred to held for sale. Considering the effect of these items, 2003's provision reflects a net positive change that is related to the improvement in the risk profile of the retail loan portfolio. Net interest income increased 37 percent to $335.4 million in 2003 from $244.7 million in 2002. Net interest income in First Horizon Equity Lending increased $34.2 million primarily due to an increase of 118 percent in home equity lines of credit, which averaged $2.1 billion in 2003 compared to $1.0 billion in 2002. The remaining increase of $56.5 million in net interest income primarily reflects the impact of a larger portfolio of loans held for sale (warehouse), which grew 46 percent on average to $4.4 billion in 2003 from $3.0 billion in 2002. Construction lending contributed $10.1 million to the growth in net interest income as the construction loan portfolio grew 60 percent to $.7 billion in 2003. Net interest spread on the warehouse, however, was negatively impacted by lower mortgage rates compared to 2002. Noninterest expense increased 26 percent in 2003 to $512.6 million compared to $406.1 million in 2002. The growth was primarily the result of a 17 percent increase in personnel expense resulting from higher commission expense related to the increased mortgage origination volume produced during 2003. Pre-tax income for fourth quarter 2003 decreased 37 percent to $84.4 million from $133.6 million in fourth quarter 2002. Total revenues for the quarter were $205.9 million, a decrease of 18 percent from $252.3 million in fourth quarter 2002. Noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2003 decreased 1 percent to $114.8 million from $116.3 million in 2002. The reasons for these quarter-to-quarter trends reflect the rising interest rate environment experienced in fourth quarter 2003, as origination activity decreased 51 percent to $6.4 billion. During this same period, refinance activity represented only 48 percent of total originations while home purchase related originations increased 21 percent to $3.3 billion. Provision for loan losses was $6.7 million in fourth quarter 2003 compared with $2.4 million in 2002. 2002's provision reflects the positive impact of certain nonperforming loans being transferred to held for sale. Going forward, revenue from refinance loan originations will generally depend on mortgage interest rates. Over time, an increase in rates should reduce origination fees and profit from the sale of loans, but should also reduce MSR amortization expense and impairment losses, while a decrease in rates should increase this net revenue. Flat to rising interest rates should reduce net secondary marketing trading gains, while falling rates should increase this net revenue. If total origination volume increases and/or the yield curve steepens, net interest income from the warehouse should increase, while if volume decreases and/or the yield curve flattens, this revenue should decrease. Continued success in national cross-sell strategies should continue to increase revenues from products other than traditional mortgage origination and servicing. In addition, recently signed third party agreements are expected to add approximately $450 million of consumer loan origination volume on a quarterly basis beginning in 2004. First Tennessee Banking Group Pre-tax income for First Tennessee Banking Group (previously referred to as FTN Banking Group) decreased 17 percent to $174.8 million for 2003, compared to $210.5 million for 2002. This decline was driven by a $42.4 million drop in net interest income; however, balance sheet leveraging capacity which is normally used within First Tennessee Banking Group has been employed by the First Horizon segment as growth in the mortgage warehouse produced approximately $46 million in net interest income growth over 2002. Total revenues were $744.4 million for 2003 compared to $748.6 million for 2002. Net interest income decreased 9 percent to $411.2 million in 2003 from $453.6 million in 2002. The decline in net interest income was related to compression in the net interest margin primarily due to the repricing of assets to lower yields while liability rates have become less sensitive to rate movements in the historically low interest rate environment experienced in 2003 and due to a change in the mix of the loan portfolio to a higher percentage of floating rate products. Investment yields declined as accelerated prepayments of investments in mortgage-backed securities resulted in increased amortization of premiums in addition to the effect of proceeds from the prepaid investments being reinvested at lower rates. Noninterest income increased 13 percent in 2003 to $333.2 million compared to $295.0 million in 2002. This increase was due, in part, to a pre-tax divestiture gain of $12.5 million from the sale of FTNC's wholly owned subsidiary, First National Bank of Springdale (see also Income Tax Expense discussion below). Net securities gains were $2.4 million in 2003, compared with net losses of $9.2 million in 2002. Included in the 2003 securities gains were net gains of $8.6 million from FTNC's wholly owned venture capital subsidiary, Hickory Venture Capital Corporation, primarily resulting from the sale of a venture capital investment and net losses of $5.9 million primarily resulting from sales of lower-yielding securities in the investment portfolio. The losses in 2002 were primarily related to other-than-temporary impairment of equity investments held by FTNC's venture capital subsidiaries. Also contributing to the increase in noninterest income were growth of 14 percent in insurance revenue due to internal expansion and the 2003 acquisition by Synaxis, a wholly owned insurance broker, of an insurance agency and a 13 percent increase in return check charges. The provision for loan losses decreased to $52.3 million in 2003 from $64.2 million last year primarily due to improvement in specific allocations related to large commercial credits. (Further discussion of asset quality trends is included in the Asset Quality section below.) Going forward the level of provision for loan losses should fluctuate primarily with the strength or weakness of the Tennessee economy. Noninterest expense increased 9 percent in 2003 to $517.3 million from $473.9 million last year. Contributing to this increase were investments in initiatives promoting expense efficiencies and enhancing revenue growth of approximately $23 million in 2003 compared to approximately $9 million in 2002, higher personnel costs of $4.4 million related to growth in Synaxis, and $1.4 million of incentives associated with the sale of a venture capital investment. Pre-tax income for fourth quarter 2003 increased 140 percent to $66.3 million from $27.6 million in fourth quarter 2002. Total revenues for the quarter were $205.2 million, an increase of 14 percent from $179.8 million in fourth quarter 2002. Total noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2003 decreased 2 percent to $129.8 million compared to $132.4 million for the same period in 2002. Provision for loan losses was $9.1 million in fourth quarter 2003 compared with $19.8 million in 2002. FTN Financial Pre-tax income for FTN Financial increased 15 percent to $184.5 million for 2003, compared to $159.8 million for 2002. Total revenues increased 20 percent to $587.1 million from $490.1 million in 2002. Noninterest income increased 20 percent in 2003 to $548.3 million from $455.2 million in 2002. This increased revenue reflects continued growth and penetration into FTN Financial's targeted institutional customer base through enhanced product and service lines. Revenue growth has also been influenced by increased liquidity on the part of capital markets' depository customers as well as continued growth in capital markets' non-depository account base. Capital markets revenues from depository customers increased 25 percent and represented 39 percent of revenue while revenues from non-depository customers increased 15 percent and represented 24 percent of revenue. Other revenues sources, which include investment banking, equity research and sales, correspondent services and portfolio advisory services increased 17 percent and contributed 37 percent of revenue. The provision for loan losses was $1.0 million in 2003 compared to $.7 million in 2002. Noninterest expense increased 22 percent in 2003 to $401.6 million compared to $329.6 million in 2002. This increase was primarily due to an increase of 20 percent in personnel expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, resulting from commissions and incentives associated with the higher fee income this year. Pre-tax income for fourth quarter 2003 remained flat at $43.5 million. Total revenues for the quarter were $129.0 million, a decrease of 6 percent from $137.5 million in fourth quarter 2002. Noninterest expense for fourth quarter 2003 decreased 8 percent to $85.9 million from $93.5 million in 2002. In fourth quarter 2003, revenues from sales of fixed income products were lower, but much of this decrease was offset by higher revenues from investment banking and equity research and sales. Noninterest expense decreased as commission and incentive expense declined due to the lower sales volume. Going forward, revenues will fluctuate based on factors which include the expansion or contraction of customer demand for fixed income products which can be influenced by the strength of loan growth in the U.S. economy and volatility in the interest rate environment and equity markets. Also impacting revenue is the volume of investment banking transactions and the continued broadening of product offerings. The regulatory environment can also impact FTN Financial's performance as demonstrated by the current debate over the regulatory capital treatment of trust preferred securities that have been deconsolidated under FIN 46. If the regulators eventually decide to disallow trust preferred securities as Tier I regulatory capital, demand for this product may diminish and, exclusive of any alternative product that may be designed to replace it, the negative impact to FTNC's earnings in 2004 could be in the range of $.10 to $.15 per share. The impact on 2004 would be lessened if the implementation of any disallowance is deferred beyond the first quarter or a redesigned product attains Tier I capital classification. Transaction Processing Pre-tax income for Transaction Processing increased 51 percent to $18.7 million for 2003, compared to $12.4 million for 2002. Total revenues were $134.6 million in 2003, an increase of 12 percent from $120.4 million in 2002. Merchant revenues increased 35 percent in 2003 due largely to a divestiture gain of $10.0 million resulting from the sale of certain merchant relationships referred by selected agent banks within the merchant portfolio, as management has begun to focus on core competencies. Also impacting merchant revenue growth were acquisitions and limited recovery in the hospitality industry as transactions processed increased 18 percent. Express processing revenues decreased 6 percent as the volume of transactions processed for customers declined 9 percent compared to 2002. Noninterest expense increased 7 percent in 2003 to $115.9 million compared to $108.0 million in 2002. Losses of $8.7 million in 2003 were related to chargebacks of a failed merchant client. In 2002, operational processing errors resulted in losses of $8.5 million, primarily related to research adjustment items that were initially mishandled, causing them to become uncollectible. For fourth quarter 2003 Transaction Processing had pre-tax income $5.6 million compared to a pre-tax net loss of $4.9 million in fourth quarter 2002. Corporate The Corporate segment's results showed a pre-tax loss of $86.5 million in 2003, compared to a pre-tax loss of $95.0 million in 2002. 2003's pre-tax loss included investments of approximately $48 million, primarily incurred in the first three quarters of 2003. These investments focused on initiatives to develop an infrastructure to support business expansion and to curtail costs. In 2002, the pre-tax loss included approximately $54 million of similar investment initiatives. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for 2003 was 34.2 percent compared to 32.5 percent for 2002. The effective tax rate for 2003 was impacted by the sale of First National Bank of Springdale which, in addition to tax expense of $4.9 million recognized from the gain on the sale, resulted in an additional $4.9 million of tax expense primarily due to the difference in the book value and the tax basis of goodwill (a total of $9.8 million tax expense). First National Bank of Springdale's assets were recorded at fair value for book purposes but not for tax purposes when acquired by FTNC in 1995. Also impacting 2003's tax expense was a decrease of $6.2 million related to the settlement of prior years' tax returns. In 2002, the change in tax status of a subsidiary of First Tennessee Bank National Association resulted in a one-time decrease in tax expense of $7.5 million. Asset Quality Net charge-offs decreased to $68.0 million in 2003 compared to $98.5 million in 2002. Net charge-offs were impacted in 2003 by improvement in both the consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Nonperforming assets increased to $76.2 million on December 31, 2003, compared to $75.7 million on December 31, 2002. Provision for loan losses decreased to $86.7 million in 2003 compared to $92.2 million in 2002. The decrease in provision was diminished by the change in risk profile resulting from the sale of Money Center loans and by the transfer of certain nonperforming and retail loans to held for sale, which resulted in a combined net increase of approximately $13 million. The improvement in 2003's provision is related to this positive shift in the mix of the loan portfolio and improvement in specific allocations related to large commercial credits. An analytical model based on historical loss experience adjusted for current events, trends and economic conditions is used by management to determine the amount of provision to be recognized and to assess the adequacy of the loan loss allowance. (See the table on A-12 for an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and details on nonperforming assets and the table on A-13 for asset quality ratios). Average Balance Sheet Total average assets increased 21 percent to $25.1 billion for 2003. Total loans increased 19 percent to $12.7 billion. Loans held for sale increased 46 percent to $4.4 billion. Interest-bearing core deposits remained flat compared to 2002. Total core deposits increased 11 percent and purchased funds increased 27 percent. Average shareholders' equity increased 15 percent in 2003. (See A-17 for additional information on the balance sheet impact of certain transactions and new accounting standards.) The consolidated net interest margin decreased to 3.78 percent for 2003 compared to 4.35 percent for 2002, primarily due to the repricing of assets to lower yields while liability rates have become less sensitive to rate movements in the historically low interest rate environment experienced in 2003 and due to a change in the mix of the loan portfolio to a higher percentage of floating rate products. Investment yields declined as accelerated prepayments of investments in mortgage-backed securities resulted in increased amortization of premiums in addition to the effect of proceeds from the prepaid investments being reinvested at lower rates. In the near-term, a recent decline in prepayment volume and a slowdown in the repricing of the commercial and retail loan portfolios coupled with steps management has taken to manage the interest rate sensitivity position of the company should result in a more stable net interest margin (see A-14). Over the long-term, FTNC's strategies to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet position should allow the net interest margin to remain stable when interest rates rise. OTHER INFORMATION Further Interpretations of SFAS No. 133 On December 11, 2003, the SEC staff announced that it will soon issue a Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) on the accounting treatment of loan commitments. Based on preliminary indications, the SAB would require registrants to utilize a written option model in valuation of their loan commitments. This would result in the recognition of a liability, with entries to expense, at the inception of the loan commitment or lock date, through settlement of the loan sale. As the SEC continues to deliberate this issue, the effect of implementing this change cannot presently be determined, but upon adoption this one-time accounting adjustment could be significant, however, the ongoing economic value of the business would be unaffected.

A-16 FIRST TENNESSEE NATIONAL CORPORATION OTHER HIGHLIGHTS (Unaudited) Effective July 1, 2003, FTNC adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity", and classified its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary ($45.1 million on July 1, 2003) as term borrowings. As required by SFAS No. 150 prior periods were not restated. In prior years, FTNC has securitized certain real estate loans through a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC) and retained all of the securitized assets. The retained assets were classified on the Consolidated Statements of Condition in "Securities held to maturity". During fourth quarter 2003, FTNC elected to purchase all of the mortgage loans remaining in the REMIC ($136.3 million at repurchase). Subsequent to the repurchase of the mortgage loans, these assets are classified as retail real estate residential loans. Effective December 31, 2003, FTNC adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities", and deconsolidated its subsidiary, First Tennessee Capital I (Capital I), which has issued $100.0 million of capital securities that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by FTNC. As a result of this deconsolidation the capital securities are no longer included on FTNC's balance sheet. However, $103.0 million of junior subordinated debentures issued by FTNC to Capital I are no longer eliminated in consolidation and appear in term borrowings as of December 31, 2003. On December 31, 2003, FTNC completed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, First National Bank of Springdale (FNB) of Springdale, Arkansas to First Security Bank of Searcy, Arkansas. Immediately preceding the sale, FNB had investment securities of approximately $3.2 million, loans of approximately $166.4 million, deposits of approximately $301.1 million and equity of approximately $12.0 million.
