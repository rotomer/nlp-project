("FTN" or the "Underwriter") with respect to the issue and sale by the Trust and the purchase by the Underwriter of $200,000,000 6.30% Capital Securities, Series B (liquidation amount $1,000 per capital security) (the "Capital Securities"), representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Capital Securities are more fully described in the Prospectus (as defined below).

The Company and the Trust each understand that the Underwriter proposes to make a public offering of the Capital Securities as soon as it deems advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered. The entire proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities will be combined with the entire proceeds from the sale by the Trust to the Company of its common securities (the "Common Securities") guaranteed by the Company, to the extent set forth in the Prospectus, with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation or redemption pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement, and will be used by the Trust to purchase $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.30% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2034 (the "Subordinated Debentures") issued by the Company.

A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus and prospectus supplement that omitted information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations and was used after such effectiveness and prior to the initial delivery of the Prospectus to the Underwriter by the Company and the Trust. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus or to any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").

Neither the Prospectus nor any amendments or supplements thereto, at the time the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement was issued and at the Closing Time included or will include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Each preliminary prospectus and prospectus filed as part of the Registration Statement as originally filed or as part of any amendment thereto, or filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, complied when so filed in all material respects with the 1933 Act Regulations and each preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus delivered to the Underwriter for use in connection with the offering of Capital Securities will, at the time of such delivery, be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed 3
with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T. (2) Incorporated Documents. The documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "1934 Act Regulations") and, when read together with the other information in the Prospectus, at the time the Registration Statement became effective, at the date hereof, at the time the Prospectus was issued and at the Closing Time, did not and will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

If this Agreement is terminated by FTN in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 or Section 9(a)(i) hereof, the Company shall reimburse the Underwriter for all of its out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriter. SECTION 5. Conditions of Underwriter's Obligations. The obligations of the Underwriter to purchase and pay for the Capital Securities pursuant to this Agreement are subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Trust contained in Section 1 hereof or in certificates of any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any Trustee, delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company and the Trust of their respective covenants and other obligations hereunder, and to the following further conditions: (a) Effectiveness of Registration Statement.

At Closing Time, FTN shall have received the favorable opinion, dated as of Closing Time, of each of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Company, and Clyde A. Billings, Jr., Senior Vice President, Assistant General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriter to the effect set forth in Exhibit B-1 and Exhibit B-2 hereto, respectively, and to such further effect as counsel to the Underwriter may reasonably request. In giving such opinion, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP may rely, as to all matters governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee, upon the opinion of Clyde A. Billings, Jr., and as to all matters governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, upon the opinion of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A. In giving such opinion, Clyde A.

Each such counsel may also state that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, they have relied, to the extent they deem proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials. (c) Opinion of Special Tax Counsel for the Trust and the Company. At Closing Time, the Company, the Trust and FTN shall have received an opinion, dated as of Closing Time, of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, special tax counsel to the Trust and the Company, that (i) the Subordinated Debentures will be classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as indebtedness of the Company, (ii) the Trust will be classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation and (iii) although 14
the discussion set forth in the Prospectus under the heading "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" does not purport to discuss all possible U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Capital Securities, such discussion constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Capital Securities under current law and assuming that all of the transaction documents, including the Indenture, the Trust Agreement, the Subordinated Debenture Purchase Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement and the Common Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and the Trust, dated as of the Closing Time, will be complied with in all material respects. Such counsel may also state that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, they have relied, to the extent they deem proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials.

In giving such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to all matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the law of the State of New York, the federal law of the United States and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, upon the opinions of counsel satisfactory to FTN. Such counsel may also state that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, they have relied, to the extent they deem proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials. (g) Officers' Certificates. At Closing Time, there shall not have been, since the date of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, (A) any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, and FTN shall have received a certificate of the President or a Vice President of the Company and of the chief financial officer or chief accounting officer of the Company, dated as of the Closing Time, to the effect that (i) there has been no such material adverse change, (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 1(a) are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Time, (except for representations or warranties which by their terms speak as of a different date or dates), (iii) the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Time, and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued 15

Since the time of execution of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred a downgrading in, or withdrawal of, the rating assigned to the Capital Securities or any of the Company's other securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations, and no such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review its rating of the Capital Securities or any of the Company's securities. (k) No Objection. The NASD shall not have raised any objection with respect to the fairness and reasonableness of the underwriting terms and arrangements filed with the NASD for review. (l) Additional Documents. At Closing Time, counsel for the Underwriter shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities as herein contemplated, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Company and the Trust in connection with the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities as 16

SECTION 6. Indemnification. (a) Indemnification of Underwriter. Each of the Company and the Trust, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act as follows: (1) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (2) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company; and (3) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by FTN), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (1) or (2) above; provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); provided, further, however, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission of 17
material fact made in any preliminary prospectus, the indemnity contained in this Section 6(a) shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriter to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of the Underwriter occurs under the circumstance where (i) the Company had previously furnished copies of the Prospectus to the Underwriter, (ii) delivery of the Prospectus was required by Act to be made to such person, (iii) the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of material fact contained in the preliminary prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and (iv) there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of such securities to such person, a copy of the Prospectus. (b) Indemnification of Trust by Company. The Company agrees to indemnify the Trust against all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever as due from the Trust under Section 6(a) hereunder. (c) Indemnification of Trust, Company, Directors and Officers. The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Trust, the Company's directors, each of the Company's officers and the Trustee of the Trust who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company and the Trust within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (d) Actions against Parties; Notification. Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a), counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by FTN, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(c), counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an 18
unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (e) Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse. If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(2) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. SECTION 7. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of the Capital Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Trust, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Capital Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Capital Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Trust and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Capital Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and the Trust, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Trust and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and 19
expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Capital Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company and the Trustee of the Trust who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Trust within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the Trustees of the Trust submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Capital Securities. SECTION 9. Termination. (a) Termination; General. FTN may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company and the Trust, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of FTN, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Capital Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Capital Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq Stock Market has been suspended or materially 20
limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by either of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the NASD or any other governmental authority, or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or Tennessee authorities, or (v) there has been a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States, or (vi) there shall have come to the attention of FTN any facts that would cause them to reasonably believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Capital Securities, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading, or (vii) an official interpretation or definitive guidance from the Federal Reserve Board has been issued to the effect that trust capital securities will no longer be eligible under the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board for "Tier 1" regulatory capital treatment. As used in this Section 9, the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the Underwriter for use in confirming sales of the related Capital Securities. (b) Liabilities. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

Exhibit B-1 FORM OF OPINION OF COMPANY'S COUNSEL TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 5(b) (1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Tennessee. (2) The Trust has been duly created and is validly existing as a statutory trust in good standing under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and has the requisite trust power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus. (3) Based solely upon our review of a letter from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis dated March 29, 2004, the Company has been duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. (4) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (5) The Subordinated Debentures have been duly authorized by the Company and, when executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in the manner provided in the Indenture and sold and purchased as provided in the Subordinated Debenture Purchase Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles. (6) The Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement and the Trust Agreement have each been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Indenture Trustee (in the case of the Indenture), by the Guarantee Trustee (in the case of the Guarantee Agreement) and by the Trustees (in the case of the Trust Agreement), constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and to general equitable principles; and the Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement and the Trust Agreement have been duly qualified under the 1939 Act. (7) The statements made under the captions "Description of Junior Subordinated Debentures," "Description of Preferred Securities," "Description of Guarantees", "Relationship Among the Preferred Securities, the Corresponding Junior Subordinated Debentures and the Guarantees", "Certain Terms of Capital Securities," "Certain Terms of Subordinated Debentures," "Certain Terms of Guarantee" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus insofar as they purport to describe provisions of (i) the Trust Agreement, (ii) the Indenture, (iii) the Guarantee Agreement and (iv) the Underwriting Agreement are accurate, complete and fair, in all material respects. B-1-1
(8) Each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Capital Securities, to the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1939 Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. (9) All regulatory consents, authorizations, approvals and filings required to be obtained or made by the Company under the Federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of New York for the issuance of the Capital Securities have been obtained or made. (10) Neither the Company nor the Trust is, and upon the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities as herein contemplated and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Prospectus neither will be, an "investment company" within the meaning of the 1940 Act. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of the laws of the State of Tennessee, upon the opinion of Clyde A. Billings, Jr., Senior Vice President, Assistant General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company, (B) as to matters involving the application of the laws of the State of Delaware, upon the opinion of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A., (which opinions, in each case, shall be dated and furnished to FTN at the Closing Time and shall expressly state that such counsel may rely on such opinion as if it were addressed to them), provided that Sullivan & Cromwell LLP shall state in their opinion that they believe that they are justified in relying upon such opinions, and (C) as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company, any of the Trustees and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991). B-1-2
Exhibit B-2 FORM OF OPINION OF CLYDE A. BILLINGS, JR., SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL AND CORPORATE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 5(b) (1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Tennessee. (2) The Company has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under, or as contemplated under, the Underwriting Agreement. (3) The Company has been duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. (4) The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. (5) The Subsidiary has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. The Bank has been duly organized and is validly existing as a national banking association under the laws of the United States. The Subsidiary has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. Except as otherwise described in the Prospectus, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each of the Subsidiary and the Bank has been duly authorized and is validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (except, in the case of the Bank, as provided in 12 U.S.C. 'SS' 55, as amended) and, to the best of our knowledge, is owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity. None of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Subsidiary and the Bank was issued in violation of preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of such Subsidiary or the Bank, as the case may be. The Bank is an insured bank under the applicable provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, and no proceeding for the termination or revocation of such insurance is pending or, to our knowledge, threatened against any such subsidiary. The Bank has no subsidiaries that are depository institutions with deposits insured under the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended. B-2-1
(6) The authorized, issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company is as set forth in the column entitled "Actual" under the caption "Capitalization" in the Prospectus (except for subsequent issuances thereof, if any, contemplated under the Underwriting Agreement, pursuant to reservations, agreements or employee benefit plans, referred to in the Prospectus, pursuant to the exercise of convertible securities or options referred to in the Prospectus, or subsequent repurchases thereof, if any, pursuant to publicly announced stock repurchase programs). Such shares of capital stock have been duly authorized and validly issued by the Company and are fully paid and non-assessable, and none of such shares of capital stock was issued in violation of preemptive or other similar rights of any securityholder of the Company. (7) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and has been duly executed and delivered by the Trust. (8) The Subordinated Debentures have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (9) The Indenture, the Trust Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (10) The holders of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are not entitled to any preemptive rights under the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or the laws of the State of Tennessee to subscribe for the Capital Securities or the Subordinated Debentures. (11) The information in the Prospectus under "Certain Terms of Capital Securities", "Certain Terms of Subordinated Debentures", "Certain Terms of Guarantee", "Description of Junior Subordinated Debentures", "Description of Preferred Securities", "Description of Guarantees" and "Relationship Among the Preferred Securities, the Corresponding Junior Subordinated Debentures and the Guarantees", or any caption purporting to describe any such Securities and in the Registration Statement under Item 15, to the extent that it constitutes matters of law, summaries of legal matters or the Company's charter, bylaws or legal proceedings, or legal conclusions, has been reviewed by me and is correct in all material respects. (12) To the best of my knowledge, neither the Company, the Subsidiary nor the Bank is in violation of its charter or by-laws (or equivalent document) and no default by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including the Trust) exists in the due performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument that is described or referred to in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, other than such defaults that individually or in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or would not materially adversely affect the issue and sale of the Capital Securities or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. B-2-2
(13) The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Indenture and the Subordinated Debentures, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities as described under the caption "Use of Proceeds") and compliance by the Company with its obligations thereunder do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or Repayment Event under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets, properties or operations of the Company, the Bank or the Subsidiary pursuant to, any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or any other agreement or instrument, known to me, to which the Company, the Bank or the Subsidiary is subject, other than such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults or Repayment Events that, individually or on a cumulative basis, would not have a Material Adverse Effect or would not materially adversely affect the issue and sale of the Capital Securities or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws (or equivalent document) of the Company, the Bank or the Subsidiary or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to me, of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or operations, except for such violations as would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. (14) To the best of my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there is not pending or threatened any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries thereof is a party or to which the assets, properties or operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries thereof is subject, before or by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or which might reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the assets, properties or operations thereof or the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement, the Trust Agreement, or the Indenture or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder. To the best of my knowledge, the Company and each of its subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws administered by and regulations applicable to it of any Banking Regulator and of any other federal or state agency or authority with jurisdiction over it except where failure to so comply would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the best of my knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise subject to any consent decree, memorandum of understanding, written commitment or other supervisory agreement with any Banking Regulator or any other federal or state agency or authority, nor have the Company or any of its subsidiaries been advised by any Banking Regulator or any other federal or state agency or authority that it is contemplating issuing or requesting any of the foregoing except where being a party to or subject to such consent decree, memorandum of understanding, written commitment or other supervisory agreement would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. B-2-3
(15) All descriptions in the Prospectus of contracts and other documents to which the Company or its subsidiaries are a party are accurate in all material respects. To the best of our knowledge, there are no franchises, contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases or other instruments required to be described or referred to in the Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement other than those described or referred to therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto, and the descriptions thereof or references thereto are correct in all material respects. (16) To the best of my knowledge, there are no statutes or regulations that are required to be described in the Prospectus that are not described as required. (17) The Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement made by the Company prior to the date hereof (excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein and other than the financial statements and supporting schedules included therein or omitted therefrom and each Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1s"), as to which we express no opinion), when the Registration Statement or any such amendment or supplement became effective, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations. The Prospectus and each amendment or supplement to the Prospectus made by the Company prior to the date hereof (excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein and other than the financial statements and supporting schedules included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, complied, and as of the date hereof comply, as to form in all material respects with the requirements of 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations. (18) The documents incorporated by reference into the Prospectus or any further amendments or supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements and supporting schedules therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we express no opinion), when they were filed with the Commission, complied, and as of the date hereof comply, as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. (19) No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign, is necessary or required for the due authorization, execution or delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement, the Trust Agreement or the Subordinated Debentures, or for the performance by the Company of the transactions contemplated under the Prospectus, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement or the Trust Agreement other than under the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1939 Act and the 1939 Act Regulations, which have already been made, obtained or rendered, as applicable. (20) The Registration Statement has been declared effective under the 1933 Act. Any required filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b). To the best of our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has B-2-4
been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or are pending or threatened by the Commission. (21) The holders of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are not entitled to any preemptive rights under the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or the laws of the State of Tennessee to subscribe for the Capital Securities or the Subordinated Debentures. Nothing has come to my attention that would lead me to believe that the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto (except for financial statements and supporting schedules and other financial data included therein or omitted therefrom and for the Form T-1s, as to which I make no statement), at the time of the filing of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Commission or at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (except for financial statements and supporting schedules and other financial data included therein or omitted therefrom, as to which I make no statement), at the time the Prospectus was issued, at the time any such amended or supplemented prospectus was issued or at the Closing Time, included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of the laws of New York, upon the opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, (B) as to all matters involving the application of the laws of the State of Delaware, upon the opinion of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A., (which opinions, in each case, shall be dated and furnished to FTN at the Closing Time and shall expressly state that such counsel may rely on such opinion as if it were addressed to him), provided that Clyde A. Billings, Jr., shall state in his opinion that he believes that he is justified in relying upon such opinion, and (C) as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent he deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company, any of the Trustees and public officials. Such opinion shall not state that it is to be governed or qualified by, or that it is otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to legal opinions, including, without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the ABA Section of Business Law (1991). B-2-5
Exhibit B-3 FORM OF OPINION OF RICHARDS, LAYTON & FINGER, P.A., TO BE DELIVERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 5 (d) (1) The Trust has been duly created and is validly existing in good standing as a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust Act, and all filings required under the laws of the State of Delaware with respect to the creation and valid existence of the Trust as a statutory trust have been made. (2) Under the Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the Trust has the requisite trust power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business, all as described in the Trust Agreement and the Prospectus, and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement. (3) The Capital Securities have been duly authorized for issuance by the Trust and, when issued, executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement against payment of the consideration as set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, the Capital Securities will be validly issued and, subject to the qualifications set forth in this paragraph, fully paid and non-assessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Capital Security Holders will be entitled to the benefits of the Trust Agreement and, as beneficial owners of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We note that the Capital Security Holders may be obligated pursuant to the Trust Agreement to (i) provide indemnity and/or security in connection with and pay taxes or governmental charges arising from transfers or exchanges of capital security certificates and the issuance of replacement capital security certificates and (ii) provide security or indemnity in connection with requests of or directions to the Property Trustee to exercise its rights and remedies under the Trust Agreement. (4) The Common Securities have been duly authorized for issuance by the Trust and, when issued, executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement against payment of the consideration as set forth in the Trust Agreement, the Common Securities will be validly issued and, subject to the qualifications set forth in this paragraph and except to the extent provided in certain sections of the Trust Agreement, fully-paid and non-assessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Common Security Holder will be entitled to the benefits of the Trust Agreement and, as a beneficial owner of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We note that the Common Security Holder may be obligated pursuant to the Trust Agreement to (i) provide indemnity and/or security in connection with and pay taxes or governmental charges arising from transfers or exchanges of capital security certificates and the issuance of replacement capital security certificates and (ii) provide security or indemnity in connection with requests of or directions to the Trustees. In addition, we B-3-1
note that under Section 10.2 of the Trust Agreement, the Common Security Holder is responsible for the debts and obligations of the Trust. (5) Under the Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the issuance of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities is not subject to preemptive or other similar rights. (6) Under the Trust Agreement and the Statutory Trust Act, the execution and delivery by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement, and the performance by the Trust of its obligations thereunder, have been duly authorized by all necessary trust action on the part of the Trust. (7) The Trust Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company and the Trustees and is enforceable against the Company and the Trustees in accordance with its terms. (8) The issuance and sale by the Trust of the Capital Securities, the purchase by the Trust of the Subordinated Debentures, the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement, the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated thereby and compliance by the Trust with its obligations thereunder do not violate (i) any of the provisions of the Certificate or the Trust Agreement or (ii) any Delaware law or Delaware administrative regulation applicable to the Trust. (9) No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any Delaware court or Delaware governmental authority or Delaware agency is necessary or required solely in connection with the issuance and sale by the Trust of the Capital Securities, the purchase by the Trust of the Subordinated Debentures, the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement, the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated thereby and compliance by the Trust with its obligations thereunder. The opinions expressed in paragraphs 3, 4 and 7 above are subject, as to enforcement, to the effect upon the Trust Agreement of (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, receivership, reorganization, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance or transfer and other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, (ii) principles of equity, including applicable law relating to fiduciary duties (regardless of whether considered and applied in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (iii) the effect of applicable public policy on the enforceability of provisions relating to indemnification or contribution.

The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from March 29, 2004 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2004, at the rate of 6.30% per annum, until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable, plus Additional Interest, if any, until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment and on any overdue principal and (without duplication and to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the rate of 6.30% per annum, compounded semi-annually. The amount of interest payable for any period shall be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day months and a 360-day year. The amount of interest payable for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then a payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or the principal office of the Property Trustee under the Trust Agreement, dated March 29, 2004 (the "Trust Agreement") for the Trust, among the Company, as Depositor, The Bank of New York, as Property Trustee, The Bank of New York (Delaware), as Delaware Trustee, and the Administrative Trustees named therein, is closed for business. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which shall be, for so long as this Security is held by the Trust or in Global form, the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date and, if this Security is not held by the Trust or in Global form, fifteen days prior to the Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such
Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or traded, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or self-regulatory organization, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time during the term of this Security to defer payment of interest on this Security, at any time or from time to time, for up to 10 consecutive semi-annual interest payment periods with respect to each deferral period (each an "Extension Period"), during which Extension Periods the Company shall have the right to make partial payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date, and at the end of which the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid (together with Additional Interest thereon to the extent permitted by applicable law); provided, however, that no Extension Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of this Security; provided, further, that during any such Extension Period, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock or (ii) make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt security of the Company that ranks pari passu with or junior in interest to this Security or (iii) make any guarantee payments regarding any guarantee by the Company of the debt securities of any Subsidiary of the Company if such guarantee ranks pari passu with or junior in interest to this Security (other than (a) dividends or distributions in the Company's capital stock, (b) dividends declared in connection with the implementation of a Rights Plan or the redemption or repurchase of any rights distributed pursuant to a Rights Plan, (c) payments under the Guarantee with respect to this Security and (d) purchases of Common Stock related to the issuance of Common Stock or rights or options under any of the Company's benefit plans for its directors, officers, employees or other persons within the definition of "employee" for purposes of a registration of shares for an employee benefit plan of the Company, related to the issuance of Common Stock or rights under a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, or related to the issuance of Common Stock (or securities convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock) as consideration in an acquisition transaction that was entered into prior to the commencement of such Extension Period). Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Company may further defer the payment of interest, provided that no Extension Period shall exceed 10 consecutive semi-annual periods or extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of this Security. Upon the termination of any such Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Interest then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period except at the end thereof. The Company shall give the Holder of this Security and the Trustee notice of its election to begin any Extension Period at least one Business Day prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date on which interest on this Security would be payable but for such deferral or, with respect to the Securities issued to the Trust, so long as such Securities are held by such Trust, prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding date on which Distributions on the Preferred Securities would be payable but for such deferral or (ii) the date the Administrative Trustees are required to give notice to any securities exchange or other applicable self-regulatory organization -2-
or to holders of such Preferred Securities of the record date or the date such Distributions are payable, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such record date.

The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by its acceptance hereof, waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such holder upon said provisions. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. -3-

Dated: March 29, 2004 THE BANK OF NEW YORK as Trustee By: /s/ Barbara Bevelaqua ----------------------------------- Name: Barbara Bevelaqua Title: Vice President
REVERSE OF SECURITY This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued under a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of December 30, 1996 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof. All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture or in the Trust Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture or the Trust Agreement, as the case may be. The Company may at any time, at its option, on or after April 15, 2009, and subject to the terms and conditions of Article XI of the Indenture, redeem this Security in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, together with accrued interest to but excluding the Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. If at any time a Tax Event, Capital Treatment Event or Investment Company Event occurs, then the Company shall have the right to redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, at any time within 90 days following the occurrence of the Tax Event, Capital Treatment Event or Investment Company Event, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount hereof plus accrued and unpaid interest hereon to the Redemption Date. "Tax Event," with respect to the Securities held by the Trust, means that the Trust has received an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of any amendment to, or change (including any announced proposed change) in, the laws (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or as a result of any official administrative pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, which amendment or change is effective or which proposed change, pronouncement or decision is announced on or after the date of issuance of the Trust's 6.30% Capital Securities, Series B (the "Capital Securities") there is more than an insubstantial risk that: (i) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of the date of such Opinion of Counsel, subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to income received or accrued on the Securities; (ii) interest payable by the Company on the Securities is not, or within 90 days of the date of such Opinion of Counsel, will not be, deductible by the Company, in whole or in part, for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (iii) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of the date of such Opinion of Counsel, subject to more than a de minimis amount of other taxes, duties or other governmental charges. With respect to Securities that are no longer held by the Trust, "Tax Event" means the receipt by the Company of an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of any amendment to, or change (including any announced proposed change) in, the
laws (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or as a result of any official administrative pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, which amendment or change is effective or which proposed change, pronouncement or decision is announced on or after the date of issuance of the Securities under the Indenture, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest payable by the Company on the Securities is not, or within 90 days of the date of such Opinion of Counsel will not be, deductible by the Company, in whole or in part, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. "Capital Treatment Event," with respect to the Trust, means the reasonable determination by the Company that, as a result of any amendment to, or change (including any proposed change) in, the laws (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, or as a result of any official or administrative pronouncement or action or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, which amendment or change is effective or such prospective change, pronouncement, action or decision is announced on or after the date of issuance of the Preferred Securities of the Trust, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Company will not be entitled to treat an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount (as defined in the related Trust Agreement) of such Preferred Securities as "Tier 1 Capital" (or the then equivalent thereof) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve, as then in effect and applicable to the Company. If such an amendment, change, pronouncement, action or decision effects or changes a limit on the amount of securities such as the Preferred Securities issued by First Tennessee Capital II that can be treated as "Tier 1" regulatory capital, then, in determining the risk that the Company will not be entitled to include the full Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities issued by First Tennessee Capital II in its "Tier 1" regulatory capital (or the then equivalent thereof), the Company shall assume that the Company's existing capital securities designated as the "8.07% Capital Securities, Series A" will first be used to satisfy (i.e., count towards) any such limit. "Investment Company Event" means that the Trust has received an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of any amendment to, or change (including any announced proposed change) in, the applicable laws (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or other governmental agency or regulatory authority of or in the United States or official or administrative pronouncement or action or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, which amendment or change is effective or which proposed change, pronouncement or decision is announced on or after the date of original issuance of the capital securities, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Trust is or will be considered an "investment company" that is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The provisions of Section 11.7 of the Indenture shall not apply to this Security. The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction and discharge of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee at any time to enter into a supplemental indenture or indentures for the purpose of modifying in any manner the rights and obligations of the Company and of the Holders of the Securities, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series to be affected by such supplemental indenture. The Indenture -2-
also contains provisions permitting Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of this series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), provided that, in the case of the Securities of this series issued to the Trust, if upon an Event of Default, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series fails to declare the principal of all the Securities of this series to be immediately due and payable, the holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities then outstanding shall have such right by a notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee; and upon any such declaration the principal amount of and the accrued interest (including any Additional Interest) on all the Securities of this series shall become immediately due and payable, provided that the payment of principal and interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article XIII of the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained under Section 10.2 of the Indenture duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. -3-
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of such series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. The Company and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest herein, the Holder of and any Person that acquires a beneficial interest in, this Security intend that this Security constitutes indebtedness and each agrees to treat this Security as indebtedness for U.S. federal, state and local tax purposes. THE INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF. -4-

upon Liquidation Amounts) not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Capital Securities not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Property Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the Liquidation Amount of Capital Securities of a denomination larger than $1,000. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Security Registrar in writing of the Capital Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Capital Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Capital Securities shall relate, in the case of any Capital Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the Liquidation Amount of Capital Securities that has been or is to be redeemed. SECTION 4.3. Subordination of Common Securities. (a) Payment of Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on, and the Redemption Price of, the Trust Securities, as applicable, shall be made, subject to Section 4.2(f), pro rata among the Common Securities and the Capital Securities based on the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities; provided, however, that if on any Distribution Date or Redemption Date any Event of Default resulting from a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on, or Redemption Price of, any Common Security, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on all Outstanding Capital Securities for all Distribution periods terminating on or prior thereto, or in the case of payment of the Redemption Price the full amount of such Redemption Price on all Outstanding Capital Securities then called for redemption, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds immediately available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) on, or the Redemption Price of, Capital Securities then due and payable. (b) In the case of the occurrence of any Event of Default resulting from any Debenture Event of Default, the Holder of Common Securities will be deemed to have waived any right to act with respect to any such Event of Default under this Trust Agreement until the effect of all such Events of Default with respect to the Capital Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until any such Event of Default under this Trust Agreement with respect to the Capital Securities has been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the Capital Securities and not the Holder of the Common Securities, and only the Holders of the Capital Securities will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf. -19-
SECTION 4.4. Payment Procedures. Payments of Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if applicable) in respect of the Capital Securities shall be made by wire transfer, direct deposit or check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Securities Register or, if the Capital Securities are held by a Clearing Agency, such Distributions shall be made to the Clearing Agency in immediately available funds, which shall credit the relevant Persons' accounts at such Clearing Agency on the applicable Distribution Dates. Payments in respect of the Common Securities shall be made in such manner as shall be mutually agreed in writing between the Property Trustee and the Common Securityholder. SECTION 4.5. Tax Returns and Reports. The Administrative Trustees shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at the Depositor's expense, and file all United States federal, state and local tax and information returns and reports required to be filed by or in respect of the Trust. In this regard, the Administrative Trustees shall (a) prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) the appropriate Internal Revenue Service forms and returns required to be filed in respect of the Trust in each taxable year of the Trust and (b) prepare and furnish (or cause to be prepared and furnished) to each Securityholder the appropriate Internal Revenue Service forms and returns, if any, and the information required to be provided by the Trust on such forms and returns. The Administrative Trustees shall provide the Depositor and the Property Trustee with a copy of all such returns and reports promptly after such filing or furnishing. The Trustees shall comply with United States federal withholding and backup withholding tax laws and information reporting requirements with respect to any payments to Securityholders under the Trust Securities. SECTION 4.6. Payment of Taxes, Duties, Etc. of the Issuer Trust. Upon receipt under the Debentures of Additional Sums, the Property Trustee shall promptly pay any taxes, duties or governmental charges of whatsoever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed on the Trust by the United States or any other taxing authority. SECTION 4.7. Payments under Indenture or Pursuant to Direct Actions. Any amount payable hereunder to any Holder of Capital Securities shall be reduced by the amount of any corresponding payment such Holder (or an Owner with respect to the Holder's Capital Securities) has directly received pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture or Section 5.14 of this Trust Agreement. -20-
ARTICLE V TRUST SECURITIES CERTIFICATES SECTION 5.1. Initial Ownership. Upon the creation of the Trust and the contribution by the Depositor pursuant to Section 2.3 and until the issuance of the Trust Securities, and at any time during which no Trust Securities are outstanding, the Depositor shall be the sole beneficial owner of the Trust. SECTION 5.2. The Trust Securities Certificates. The Capital Securities Certificates shall be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 Liquidation Amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, and the Common Securities Certificates shall be issued in denominations of $1,000 Liquidation Amount and integral multiples thereof. The Trust Securities Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual or facsimile signature of at least one Administrative Trustee and, if executed on behalf of the Trust by facsimile, countersigned by a transfer agent or its agent. The Capital Securities Certificates shall be authenticated by the Property Trustee by manual or facsimile signature of an authorized signatory thereof and, if executed by such authorized signatory of the Property Trustee by facsimile, countersigned by a transfer agent or its agent. Trust Securities Certificates bearing the manual signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Trust or the Property Trustee or, if executed on behalf of the Trust or the Property Trustee by facsimile, countersigned by a transfer agent or its agent, shall be validly issued and entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates. A transferee of a Trust Securities Certificate shall become a Securityholder, and shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Securityholder hereunder, upon due registration of such Trust Securities Certificate in such transferee's name pursuant to Sections 5.4, 5.11 and 5.13. SECTION 5.3. Execution and Delivery of Trust Securities Certificates. On the Closing Date, the Administrative Trustees shall cause Trust Securities Certificates, in an aggregate Liquidation Amount as provided in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, to be executed on behalf of the Trust and delivered to or upon the written order of the Depositor, signed by its chairman of the board, its chief executive officer, its president, any executive vice president, any senior vice president or any vice president, treasurer or assistant treasurer or controller without further corporate action by the Depositor, in authorized denominations. -21-
SECTION 5.4. Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Capital Securities Certificates. The Depositor shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.8, a register or registers for the purpose of registering Trust Securities Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Capital Securities Certificates (the "Securities Register") in which the transfer agent and registrar designated by the Depositor (the "Securities Registrar"), subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, shall provide for the registration of Capital Securities Certificates and Common Securities Certificates (subject to Section 5.10 in the case of the Common Securities Certificates) and registration of transfers and exchanges of Capital Securities Certificates as herein provided. The Bank shall be the initial Securities Registrar. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Capital Securities Certificate at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.8, the Administrative Trustees or any one of them shall execute on behalf of the Trust (and if executed on behalf of the Trust by a facsimile signature, such certificate shall be countersigned by a transfer agent or its agent) and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Capital Securities Certificates in authorized denominations of a like aggregate Liquidation Amount dated the date of execution by such Administrative Trustee or Trustees. The Securities Registrar shall not be required to register the transfer of any Capital Securities that have been called for redemption during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of selection for such redemption. At the option of a Holder, Capital Securities Certificates may be exchanged for other Capital Securities Certificates in authorized denominations of the same class and of a like aggregate Liquidation Amount upon surrender of the Capital Securities Certificates to be exchanged at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.8. Every Capital Securities Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to an Administrative Trustee and the Securities Registrar duly executed by the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing. Each Capital Securities Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be cancelled and subsequently disposed of by an Administrative Trustee or the Securities Registrar in accordance with such Person's customary practice. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Capital Securities Certificates, but the Securities Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Capital Securities Certificates. SECTION 5.5. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Trust Securities Certificates. If (a) any mutilated Trust Securities Certificate shall be surrendered to the Securities Registrar, or if the Securities Registrar shall receive evidence to its satisfaction -22-
of the destruction, loss or theft of any Trust Securities Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered to the Securities Registrar and the Administrative Trustees such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Trust Securities Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Administrative Trustees, or any one of them, on behalf of the Trust shall execute by manual or facsimile signature and, if executed on behalf of the Trust by facsimile signature, such certificate shall be countersigned by a transfer agent, and make available for delivery, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust Securities Certificate, a new Trust Securities Certificate of like class, tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Securities Certificate under this Section, the Administrative Trustees or the Securities Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Securities Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an undivided beneficial interest in the Trust Property, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate shall be found at any time. SECTION 5.6. Persons Deemed Securityholders. The Trustees or the Securities Registrar shall treat the Person in whose name any Trust Securities Certificate shall be registered in the Securities Register as the owner of such Trust Securities Certificate for the purpose of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever, and neither the Trustees nor the Securities Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the contrary. SECTION 5.7. Access to List of Securityholders' Names and Addresses. Each Holder and each Owner shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold the Depositor, the Property Trustee or the Administrative Trustees accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from which such information was derived. SECTION 5.8. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Administrative Trustees shall maintain an office or offices or agency or agencies where Capital Securities Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Trustees in respect of the Trust Securities Certificates may be served. The Administrative Trustees initially designate The Bank of New York, 101 Barclay Street, Floor 8 West, New York, New York 10286, Attn: Corporate Trust Administration, as its principal corporate trust office for such purposes. The Administrative Trustees shall give prompt written notice to the Depositor, the Property Trustee and to the Securityholders of any change in the location of the Securities Register or any such office or agency. -23-
SECTION 5.9. Appointment of Paying Agent. The Paying Agent shall make Distributions to Securityholders from the Payment Account and shall report the amounts of such Distributions to the Property Trustee and the Administrative Trustees. Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Payment Account for the purpose of making the Distributions referred to above. The Administrative Trustees may revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent if such Trustees determine in their sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Trust Agreement in any material respect. The Paying Agent shall initially be the Bank, and any co-paying agent chosen by the Bank, and acceptable to the Administrative Trustees and the Depositor. Any Person acting as Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days' written notice to the Administrative Trustees, the Property Trustee and the Depositor. In the event that the Bank shall no longer be the Paying Agent or a successor Paying Agent shall resign or its authority to act be revoked, the Administrative Trustees shall appoint a successor that is acceptable to the Property Trustee and the Depositor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The Administrative Trustees shall cause such successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the Administrative Trustees to execute and deliver to the Trustees an instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustees that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Securityholders in trust for the benefit of the Securityholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Securityholders. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Property Trustee and upon resignation or removal of a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its possession to the Property Trustee. The provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.3 and 8.6 herein shall apply to the Bank also in its role as Paying Agent, for so long as the Bank shall act as Paying Agent and, to the extent applicable, to any other paying agent appointed hereunder, and any Paying Agent shall be bound by the requirements with respect to paying agents of securities issued pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act. Any reference in this Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context requires otherwise. SECTION 5.10. Ownership of Common Securities by Depositor. On the Closing Date, the Depositor shall acquire and retain beneficial and record ownership of the Common Securities. To the fullest extent permitted by law, other than a transfer in connection with a consolidation or merger of the Depositor into another Person, any conveyance, transfer or lease by the Depositor of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Indenture, or a transfer to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Depositor, any attempted transfer of the Common Securities shall be void. The Administrative Trustees shall cause each Common Securities Certificate issued to the Depositor to contain a legend stating "THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE TO A PERSON WHO IS NOT A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF HOLDER". -24-
SECTION 5.11. Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates; Common Securities Certificate. (a) The Capital Securities Certificates, upon original issuance, will be issued in the form of a printed or typewritten Capital Securities Certificate or Certificates representing Book-Entry Capital Securities, to be delivered to The Depository Trust Company, the initial Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Trust. Such Capital Securities Certificate or Certificates shall initially be registered on the Securities Register in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the initial Clearing Agency, and no Owner will receive a Definitive Capital Securities Certificate representing such Owner's interest in such Capital Securities, except as provided in Section 5.13. Unless and until Definitive Capital Securities Certificates have been issued to Owners pursuant to Section 5.13: (i) the provisions of this Section 5.11(a) shall be in full force and effect; (ii) the Securities Registrar and the Trustees shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Trust Agreement relating to the Book-Entry Capital Securities (including the payment of the Liquidation Amount of and Distributions on the Capital Securities evidenced by Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates and the giving of instructions or directions to Owners of Capital Securities evidenced by Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates) as the sole Holder of Capital Securities evidenced by Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates and shall have no obligations to the Owners thereof; (iii) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 5.11 conflict with any other provisions of this Trust Agreement, the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall control; and (iv) the rights of the Owners of the Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants. Pursuant to the Certificate Depository Agreement, unless and until Definitive Capital Securities Certificates are issued pursuant to Section 5.13, the initial Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit payments on the Capital Securities to such Clearing Agency Participants. (b) A single Common Securities Certificate representing the Common Securities shall be issued to the Depositor in the form of a definitive Common Securities Certificate. -25-
SECTION 5.12. Notices to Clearing Agency. To the extent that a notice or other communication to the Owners is required under this Trust Agreement, unless and until Definitive Capital Securities Certificates shall have been issued to Owners pursuant to Section 5.13, the Trustees shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to Owners to the Clearing Agency, and shall have no obligations to the Owners. SECTION 5.13. Definitive Capital Securities Certificates. If (a) the Depositor advises the Trustees in writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to the Capital Securities Certificates, and the Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor, or if at any time when the Clearing Agency ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at a time when the Clearing Agency is required to be so registered to act as the depositary, (b) the Depositor at its option advises the Trustees in writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency or (c) after the occurrence of a Debenture Event of Default, Owners of Capital Securities Certificates representing beneficial interests aggregating at least a majority of the Liquidation Amount advise the Administrative Trustees in writing that the continuation of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best interest of the Owners of Capital Securities Certificates, then the Administrative Trustees shall notify the other Trustees and the Clearing Agency, and the Clearing Agency, in accordance with its customary rules and procedures, shall notify all Clearing Agency Participants for whom it holds Capital Securities of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of the Definitive Capital Securities Certificates to Owners of such class or classes, as applicable, requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Administrative Trustees of the printed or typewritten Capital Securities Certificate or Certificates representing the Book-Entry Capital Securities by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Administrative Trustees, or any one of them, shall execute the Definitive Capital Securities Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency which, if executed on behalf of the Trust by facsimile, shall be countersigned by a transfer agent or its agent. Neither the Securities Registrar nor the Trustees shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Capital Securities Certificates, the Trustees shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Capital Securities Certificates as Securityholders. The Definitive Capital Securities Certificates shall be typewritten, printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees that meets the requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Capital Securities are then listed or approved for trading, as evidenced by the execution thereof by the Administrative Trustees or any one of them. -26-
SECTION 5.14. Rights of Securityholders. (a) The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) in accordance with Section 2.9, and the Securityholders shall not have any right or title therein other than the undivided beneficial ownership interest in the assets of the Trust conferred by their Trust Securities and they shall have no right to call for any partition or division of property, profits or rights of the Trust except as described below. The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust Agreement. The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights and when issued and delivered to Securityholders against payment of the purchase price therefor will be fully paid and nonassessable by the Trust. The Holders of the Capital Securities, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. (b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default, the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall have such right by a notice in writing to the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee; and upon any such declaration such principal amount of and the accrued interest on all of the Debentures shall become immediately due and payable as set forth in the Indenture, provided that the payment of principal, premium and interest on such Debentures shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in the Indenture. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as in the Indenture provided, the Holders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Depositor has paid or deposited with the Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue installments of interest (including any Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture)) on all of the Debentures, (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debentures which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and (C) all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and -27-
advances of the Debenture Trustee and the Property Trustee, their agents and counsel; and (ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13 of the Indenture. The holders of a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal, premium or interest (unless all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or annulled as provided in Section 5.3 of the Indenture and the Company has paid or deposited with the Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all overdue installments of interest (including any Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture)) on the Debentures, the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debentures which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee and the Property trustee, their agents and counsel) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Debenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of the Capital Securities all or part of which is represented by Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice which has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.14(b). -28-
(c) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Indenture, upon a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(1) or 5.1(2) of the Indenture, any Holder of Capital Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Depositor, pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of the principal amount of or premium or interest on Debentures having a principal amount equal to the Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a "Direct Action"). Except as set forth in Section 5.14(b) and this Section 5.14(c), the Holders of Capital Securities shall have no right to exercise directly any right or remedy available to the holders of, or in respect of, the Debentures. SECTION 5.15. CUSIP Numbers. The Administrative Trustees in issuing the Capital Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Property Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Capital Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Capital Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Administrative Trustees will promptly notify the Property Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers. ARTICLE VI ACTS OF SECURITYHOLDERS; MEETINGS; VOTING SECTION 6.1. Limitations on Voting Rights. (a) Except as provided in this Section, in Sections 5.14, 8.10 and 10.3 and in the Indenture and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Capital Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Securityholders from time to time as partners or members of an association. (b) So long as any Debentures are held by the Property Trustee, the Trustees shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or executing any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to such Debentures, (ii) waive any past default which is waiveable under Section 5.13 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures, where such consent shall be required, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least a majority in Liquidation Amount of all -29-
Outstanding Capital Securities, provided, however, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of each holder of Debentures affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent of each Holder of Capital Securities. The Trustees shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of Capital Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any notice of default received from the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Capital Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Administrative Trustees shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action shall not cause the Trust to fail to be classified as a grantor trust or cause the Trust to be taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. (c) If any proposed amendment to the Trust Agreement provides for, or the Trustees otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect in any material respect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Capital Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Trust Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Capital Securities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement, no amendment to this Trust Agreement may be made if, as a result of such amendment, it would cause the Trust to fail to be classified as a grantor trust or to be taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. SECTION 6.2. Notice of Meetings. Notice of all meetings of the Capital Securityholders, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 10.9 to each Capital Securityholder of record, at his registered address, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting. At any such meeting, any business properly before the meeting may be so considered whether or not stated in the notice of the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice. SECTION 6.3. Meetings of Capital Securityholders. No annual meeting of Securityholders is required to be held. The Administrative Trustees, however, shall call a meeting of Capital Securityholders to vote on any matter upon the written request of the Capital Securityholders of record of 25% of the Outstanding Capital Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) and the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee may, at any time in their discretion, call a -30-
meeting of Capital Securityholders to vote on any matters as to which Capital Securityholders are entitled to vote. Capital Securityholders of record of 50% of the Outstanding Capital Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount), present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Capital Securityholders. If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Capital Securityholders of record present, in person or by proxy, holding at least a majority of the Outstanding Capital Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) held by holders of record of Outstanding Capital Securities present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Capital Securityholders, unless this Trust Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes. SECTION 6.4. Voting Rights. Securityholders shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 of Liquidation Amount represented by their Trust Securities in respect of any matter as to which such Securityholders are entitled to vote. SECTION 6.5. Proxies, etc. At any meeting of Securityholders, any Securityholder entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Administrative Trustees, or with such other officer or agent of the Trust as the Administrative Trustees may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Securityholders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several Persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Securityholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution. SECTION 6.6. Securityholder Action by Written Consent. Any action which may be taken by Securityholders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if Securityholders holding at least a majority of all Outstanding Trust Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any express provision of this Trust Agreement) shall consent to the action in writing. -31-
SECTION 6.7. Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes. For the purposes of determining the Securityholders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any Distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrative Trustees may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Securityholders or the payment of a Distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Securityholders of record for such purposes. SECTION 6.8. Acts of Securityholders. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Securityholders or Owners may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Securityholders or Owners in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to an Administrative Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Securityholders or Owners signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which any Trustee receiving the same deems sufficient. The ownership of Capital Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Securityholder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Securityholder of the same Trust Security and the Securityholder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustees or the Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security. -32-
Without limiting the foregoing, a Securityholder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount. If any dispute shall arise between the Securityholders and the Administrative Trustees or among such Securityholders or Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Securityholder or Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter. SECTION 6.9. Inspection of Records. Upon reasonable notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee, the records of the Trust shall be open to inspection by Securityholders during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to such Securityholder's interest as a Securityholder. ARTICLE VII REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SECTION 7.1. Representations and Warranties of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee.

SECTION 7.2. Representations and Warranties of Depositor. The Depositor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Securityholders that: -34-
(a) the Trust Securities Certificates issued at the Closing Date on behalf of the Trust have been duly authorized and will have been, duly and validly executed, issued and delivered by the Trustees pursuant to the terms and provisions of, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Trust Agreement and the Securityholders will be, as of such date, entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement; and (b) there are no taxes, fees or other governmental charges payable by the Trust (or the Trustees on behalf of the Trust) under the laws of the State of Delaware or any political subdivision thereof in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, of this Trust Agreement. ARTICLE VIII THE TRUSTEES SECTION 8.1. Certain Duties and Responsibilities. (a) The duties and responsibilities of the Trustees shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement and, in the case of the Property Trustee, by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Trustees to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of their rights or powers, if they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to them. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall be construed to release an Administrative Trustee from liability for its own gross negligent action, its own gross negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Administrative Trustee has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust or to the Securityholders, such Administrative Trustee shall not be liable to the Trust or to any Securityholder for such Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Trust Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Depositor and the Securityholders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees. (b) All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Securityholder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that -35-
the Trustees are not personally liable to it for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act. (c) No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (i) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement; (iii) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Debentures and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act; (iv) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree in writing with the Depositor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law; and (v) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor. SECTION 8.2. Certain Notices. Within five Business Days after the occurrence of any Event of Default actually known to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.9, notice of such Event of Default to the -36-
Securityholders, the Administrative Trustees and the Depositor, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived. Within five Business Days after the receipt of notice of the Depositor's exercise of its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, the Administrative Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.9, notice of such exercise to the Securityholders and the Property Trustee, unless such exercise shall have been revoked. SECTION 8.3. Certain Rights of Property Trustee. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1: (a) the Property Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting in good faith upon any resolution, Opinion of Counsel, certificate, written representation of a Holder or transferee, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (b) if (i) in performing its duties under this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of action or (ii) in construing any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee finds the same ambiguous or inconsistent with any other provisions contained herein or (iii) the Property Trustee is unsure of the application of any provision of this Trust Agreement, then, except as to any matter as to which the Capital Securityholders are entitled to vote under the terms of this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall deliver a notice to the Depositor requesting written instructions of the Depositor as to the course of action to be taken and the Property Trustee shall take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as the Property Trustee shall be instructed in writing to take, or to refrain from taking, by the Depositor; provided, however, that if the Property Trustee does not receive such instructions of the Depositor within ten Business Days after it has delivered such notice, or such reasonably shorter period of time set forth in such notice (which to the extent practicable shall not be less than two Business Days), it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action not inconsistent with this Trust Agreement as it shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Securityholders, in which event the Property Trustee shall have no liability except for its own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct; (c) any direction or act of the Depositor or the Administrative Trustees contemplated by this Trust Agreement shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate; (d) whenever in the administration of this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be established before undertaking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Property Trustee (unless other evidence is herein -37-
specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, request and rely upon an Officers' Certificate which, upon receipt of such request, shall be promptly delivered by the Depositor or the Administrative Trustees; (e) the Property Trustee shall have no duty to see to any recording, filing or registration of any instrument (including any financing or continuation statement or any filing under tax or securities laws) or any rerecording, refiling or reregistration thereof; (f) the Property Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection (which counsel may be counsel to the Depositor or any of its Affiliates, and may include any of its employees) and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon and in accordance with such advice; the Property Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the administration of this Trust Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction; (g) the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement at the request or direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to this Trust Agreement, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Property Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; (h) the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do so by one or more Securityholders, but the Property Trustee may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit; (i) the Property Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or attorneys, provided that the Property Trustee shall be responsible for any negligence or recklessness on the part of such agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; (j) whenever in the administration of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive written instructions with respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder the Property Trustee (i) may request written instructions from the Holders of the Trust Securities which written instructions may only be given by the Holders of the same proportion in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities as would be entitled to direct the Property Trustee under the terms of the Trust Securities in respect of such remedy, right or action, (ii) may refrain from enforcing such remedy or right or taking such other action until such written instructions are received, and (iii) shall be protected in acting in accordance with such written instructions; and -38-
(k) except as otherwise expressly provided by this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action that is discretionary under the provisions of this Trust Agreement. No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on the Property Trustee to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which the Property Trustee shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts, or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or authority available to the Property Trustee shall be construed to be a duty. SECTION 8.4. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities. The recitals contained herein and in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be taken as the statements of the Trust, and the Trustees do not assume any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustees shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Depositor of the proceeds of the Debentures. SECTION 8.5. May Hold Securities. Any Trustee or any other agent of any Trustee or the Trust, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Trust Securities and, subject to Sections 8.8 and 8.13, except as provided in the definition of the term "Outstanding" in Article I, may otherwise deal with the Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not a Trustee or such other agent. SECTION 8.6. Compensation; Indemnity; Fees. The Depositor shall: (a) pay to the Trustees from time to time such compensation as shall be agreed in writing with the Depositor for all services rendered by them hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, reimburse the Trustees upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustees in accordance with any provision of this Trust Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Trustee, (ii) any Affiliate of any Trustee, (iii) any officer, director, shareholder, employee, representative or agent of any Trustee, and (iv) any employee or -39-
agent of the Trust or its Affiliates, (referred to herein as an "Indemnified Person") from and against any and all loss, damage, liability, tax, penalty, expense or claim of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred by such Indemnified Person by reason of the creation, administration, operation or termination of the Trust or any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Trust and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be within the scope of authority conferred on such Indemnified Person by this Trust Agreement, except that no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect of any loss, damage or claim incurred by such Indemnified Person by reason of negligence or willful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions. When the Property Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(4) or Section 5.1(5) of the Indenture, the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law. The provisions of this Section 8.6 shall survive the termination of this Trust Agreement or the earlier resignation or removal of any Trustee. No Trustee may claim any lien or charge on any Trust Property as a result of any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.6. The Depositor and any Trustee (in the case of the Property Trustee, subject to Section 8.8 hereof) may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the Trust, and the Trust and the Holders of Trust Securities shall have no rights by virtue of this Trust Agreement in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if competitive with the business of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. Neither the Depositor, nor any Trustee, shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and the Depositor or any Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Depositor or any Affiliate of the Depositor, or may act as depository for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Depositor or its Affiliates. In no event shall the Trustee be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder because of circumstances beyond its control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, flood, war (whether declared or undeclared), terrorism, fire, riot, embargo, government action, including any laws, ordinances, regulations, governmental action or the like which delay, restrict or prohibit the providing of the services contemplated by this Agreement. -40-
SECTION 8.7. Corporate Property Trustee Required; Eligibility of Trustees. (a) There shall at all times be a Property Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities. The Property Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Property Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. (b) There shall at all times be one or more Administrative Trustees hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities. Each Administrative Trustee shall be either a natural person who is at least 21 years of age or a legal entity that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind that entity. (c) There shall at all times be a Delaware Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities. The Delaware Trustee shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the State of Delaware or (ii) a legal entity with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware and that otherwise meets the requirements of applicable Delaware law that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity. SECTION 8.8. Conflicting Interests. If the Property Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Trust Agreement. SECTION 8.9. Co-Trustees and Separate Trustee. Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees, by agreed action of the majority of such Trustees, shall have power to appoint, and upon the written request of the Administrative Trustees, the Depositor shall for such purpose join with the Administrative Trustees in the execution, delivery, and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, one or more Persons approved by the Property Trustee either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, or to the extent required by law to act as separate trustee of any such property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in -41-
such Person or Persons in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. If the Depositor does not join in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, or in case a Debenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee alone shall have power to make such appointment. Any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed pursuant to this Section shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the United States or (ii) a legal entity with its principal place of business in the United States that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity. Should any written instrument from the Depositor be required by any co-trustee or separate trustee so appointed for more fully confirming to such co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right, or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Depositor. Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following terms, namely: (a) The Trust Securities shall be executed and delivered and all rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Trustees specified hereunder shall be exercised solely by such Trustees and not by such co-trustee or separate trustee. (b) The rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Property Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Property Trustee or by the Property Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Property Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee. (c) The Property Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the written concurrence of the Depositor, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section, and, in case a Debenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without the concurrence of the Depositor. Upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor shall join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section. -42-
(d) No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Property Trustee or any other trustee hereunder. (e) The Property Trustee shall not be liable by reason of any act of a co-trustee or separate trustee. (f) Any Act of Holders delivered to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee. SECTION 8.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. No resignation or removal of any Trustee (the "Relevant Trustee") and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Relevant Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Common Securityholders. If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Trust, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. Unless a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of the Common Securityholder. If a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed at such time by Act of the Holders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and on behalf of the Trust). An Administrative Trustee may be removed by the Common Securityholder at any time. If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 30 days after such removal, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Trust, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. If any Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting as Trustee, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of any Trustee for any cause, at a time when no Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Common Securityholder, by Act of the Common Securityholder delivered to the retiring Trustee, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees, and the retiring Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of continuing to act as the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, at a time when a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Capital Securityholders, by Act of the Securityholders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding delivered to the retiring Relevant Trustee, shall -43-
promptly appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees, and such successor Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If an Administrative Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting as Administrative Trustee, at a time when a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Common Securityholder by Act of the Common Securityholder delivered to the Administrative Trustee shall promptly appoint a successor Administrative Trustee or Administrative Trustees and such successor Administrative Trustee or Trustees shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Common Securityholder or the Capital Securityholders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Securityholder who has been a Securityholder of Trust Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. The Property Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of a Trustee and each appointment of a successor Trustee to all Securityholders in the manner provided in Section 10.9 and shall give notice to the Depositor. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Trust Agreement, in the event any Administrative Trustee or a Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes, in the opinion of the Depositor, incompetent or incapacitated, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity may be filled by (a) the unanimous act of the remaining Administrative Trustees if there are at least two of them or (b) otherwise by the Depositor (with the successor in each case being a Person who satisfies the eligibility requirement for Administrative Trustees or Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, set forth in Section 8.7). SECTION 8.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Relevant Trustee, the retiring Relevant Trustee and each successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall execute and deliver an amendment hereto wherein each successor Relevant Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (a) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Relevant Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust and (b) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the Trust by more than one Relevant Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such amendment shall constitute such Relevant Trustees co-trustees and upon the execution and delivery of such amendment the resignation or removal of the retiring Relevant Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Relevant Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant -44-
Trustee; but, on written request of the Trust or any successor Relevant Trustee such retiring Relevant Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Relevant Trustee all Trust Property, all proceeds thereof and money held by such retiring Relevant Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust. Upon written request of any such successor Relevant Trustee, the Trust shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Relevant Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the preceding paragraph. No successor Relevant Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Relevant Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. SECTION 8.12. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any Person into which the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Relevant Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such Relevant Trustee, shall be the successor of such Relevant Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. SECTION 8.13. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Depositor or Trust. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other similar judicial proceeding relative to the Trust or any other obligor upon the Trust Securities or the property of the Trust or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Property Trustee (irrespective of whether any Distributions on the Trust Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Property Trustee shall have made any demand on the Trust for the payment of any past due Distributions) shall be entitled and empowered, to the fullest extent permitted by law, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of any Distributions owing and unpaid in respect of the Trust Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Property Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; -45-
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Property Trustee and, in the event the Property Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Property Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Property Trustee. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Property Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or compensation affecting the Trust Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Property Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding. SECTION 8.14. Reports by Property Trustee. (a) The Property Trustee shall transmit to Securityholders such reports concerning the Property Trustee and its actions under this Trust Agreement as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner provided pursuant thereto. If required by Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall, within sixty days after each May 15 following the date of this Trust Agreement deliver to Securityholders a brief report, dated as of such May 15, which complies with the provisions of such Section 313(a). (b) A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Property Trustee with each national stock exchange, the Nasdaq National Market or such other interdealer quotation system or self-regulatory organization upon which the Trust Securities are listed or traded, if any, with the Commission and with the Depositor. The Depositor will promptly notify the Property Trustee of any such listing or trading. SECTION 8.15. Reports to the Property Trustee. The Depositor and the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee such documents, reports and information as required by Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act (if any) and the compliance certificate required by Section 314(a) of the Trust Indenture Act in the form, in the manner and at the times required by Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Property Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Property Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Trust's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Property Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates). -46-
SECTION 8.16. Evidence of Compliance with Conditions Precedent. Each of the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee such evidence of compliance with any conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Trust Agreement that relate to any of the matters set forth in Section 314 (c) of the Trust Indenture Act. Any certificate or opinion required to be given by an officer pursuant to Section 314(c)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act shall be given in the form of an Officers' Certificate. SECTION 8.17. Number of Trustees. (a) The number of Trustees shall be four, provided that the Holder of all of the Common Securities by written instrument may increase or decrease the number of Administrative Trustees. The Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee may be the same Person. (b) If a Trustee ceases to hold office for any reason and the number of Administrative Trustees is not reduced pursuant to Section 8.17(a), or if the number of Trustees is increased pursuant to Section 8.17(a), a vacancy shall occur. The vacancy shall be filled with a Trustee appointed in accordance with Section 8.10. (c) The death, resignation, retirement, removal, bankruptcy, incompetence or incapacity to perform the duties of a Trustee shall not operate to dissolve, terminate or annul the Trust. Whenever a vacancy in the number of Administrative Trustees shall occur, until such vacancy is filled by the appointment of an Administrative Trustee in accordance with Section 8.10, the Administrative Trustees in office, regardless of their number (and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement), shall have all the powers granted to the Administrative Trustees and shall discharge all the duties imposed upon the Administrative Trustees by this Trust Agreement. SECTION 8.18. Delegation of Power. (a) Any Administrative Trustee may, by power of attorney consistent with applicable law, delegate to any other natural person over the age of 21 his or her power for the purpose of executing any documents contemplated in Section 2.7(a), including any registration statement or amendment thereto filed with the Commission, or making any other governmental filing; and (b) The Administrative Trustees shall have power to delegate from time to time to such of their number or to the Depositor the doing of such things and the execution of such instruments either in the name of the Trust or the names of the Administrative Trustees or otherwise as the Administrative Trustees may deem expedient, to the extent such delegation is not prohibited by applicable law or contrary to the provisions of this Trust Agreement, as set forth herein. -47-
ARTICLE IX TERMINATION, LIQUIDATION AND MERGER SECTION 9.1. Termination Upon Expiration Date. Unless earlier terminated, the Trust shall automatically terminate on December 6, 2051 (the "Expiration Date"), following the distribution of the Trust Property in accordance with Section 9.4. SECTION 9.2. Early Termination. The first to occur of any of the following events is an "Early Termination Event": (a) the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event in respect of, or the dissolution or liquidation of, the Holder of the Common Securities; (b) the written direction to the Property Trustee from the Depositor at any time to terminate the Trust and, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, distribute Debentures to Securityholders in exchange for the Capital Securities (which direction is optional and wholly within the discretion of the Depositor); (c) the redemption of all of the Capital Securities in connection with the redemption or maturity of all of the Debentures; and (d) the entry of an order for dissolution of the Trust by a court of competent jurisdiction. SECTION 9.3. Termination. The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Trustees and the Trust created and continued hereby shall terminate upon the latest to occur of the following: (a) the distribution by the Property Trustee to Securityholders upon the liquidation of the Trust pursuant to Section 9.4, or upon the redemption of all of the Trust Securities pursuant to Section 4.2, of all amounts required to be distributed hereunder upon the final payment of the Trust Securities; (b) the payment of any expenses owed by the Trust; and (c) the discharge of all administrative duties of the Administrative Trustees, including the performance of any tax reporting obligations with respect to the Trust or the Securityholders. SECTION 9.4. Liquidation. (a) If an Early Termination Event specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of Section 9.2 occurs or upon the Expiration Date, the Trust shall be liquidated by the Trustees as expeditiously as the Trustees determine to be possible by distributing, after -48-
satisfaction or the making of reasonable provisions for the payment of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each Securityholder a Like Amount of Debentures, subject to Section 9.4(d). Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid mailed not later than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All notices of liquidation shall: (i) state the CUSIP Number of the Trust Securities; (ii) state the Liquidation Date; (iii) state that from and after the Liquidation Date, the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures; and (iv) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates for Debentures, or if Section 9.4(d) applies receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee shall deem appropriate. (b) Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Trust and distribution of the Debentures to Securityholders, the Property Trustee shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 45 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates. (c) Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, after the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) certificates representing a Like Amount of Debentures will be issued to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates, upon surrender of such certificates to the Administrative Trustees or their agent for exchange, (iii) the Depositor shall use its best efforts to have the Debentures listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on such other exchange, interdealer quotation system or self-regulatory organization as the Capital Securities are then listed or traded, (iv) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures, accruing interest at the rate provided for in the Debentures from the last Distribution Date on which a Distribution was made on such Trust Securities Certificates until such certificates are so surrendered (and until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest or principal will be made to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates with respect to such Debentures) and (v) all rights of Securityholders holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right of such Securityholders to receive Debentures upon surrender of Trust Securities Certificates. -49-
(d) In the event that, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.4, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Debentures in the manner provided herein is determined by the Property Trustee not to be practical, the Trust Property shall be liquidated, and the Trust shall be dissolved, wound-up or terminated, by the Property Trustee. In such event, on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or other termination of the Trust, Securityholders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Securityholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"). If, upon any such dissolution, winding up or termination, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holder of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution, winding-up or termination pro rata (determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Capital Securities, except that, if a Debenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a priority over the Common Securities. SECTION 9.5. Mergers, Consolidations, Amalgamations or Replacements of the Trust. The Trust may not merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any corporation or other Person, except pursuant to this Article IX. At the request of the Depositor, with the consent of the Administrative Trustees and without the consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, the Trust may merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to a trust organized as such under the laws of any State; provided, that (i) such successor entity either (a) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Trust with respect to the Capital Securities or (b) substitutes for the Capital Securities other securities having substantially the same terms as the Capital Securities (the "Successor Securities") so long as the Successor Securities rank the same as the Capital Securities rank in priority with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise, (ii) the Depositor expressly appoints a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property Trustee as the holder of the Debentures, (iii) the Successor Securities are listed or traded, or any Successor Securities will be listed upon notification of issuance, on any national securities exchange or other organization on which the Capital Securities are then listed or traded, if any, (iv) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not cause the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) to be downgraded by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, (v) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, -50-
replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, (vi) such successor entity has a purpose identical to that of the Trust, (vii) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, the Depositor has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (a) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, and (b) following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, neither the Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act and (viii) the Depositor owns all of the common securities of such successor entity and guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust shall not, except with the consent of Holders of 100% in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other Person or permit any other Person to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease would cause the Trust or the successor entity to be taxable as a corporation or to be classified as other than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes. ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS SECTION 10.1. Limitation of Rights of Securityholders. The death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of any Person having an interest, beneficial or otherwise, in Trust Securities shall not operate to terminate this Trust Agreement, nor entitle the legal representatives or heirs of such Person or any Securityholder for such Person, to claim an accounting, take any action or bring any proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the arrangements contemplated hereby, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them. SECTION 10.2. Liability of the Common Securityholder. The Holder of the Common Securities shall be liable for all of the debts and obligations of the Trust (other than with respect to the Securities) to the extent not satisfied out of the Trust's assets. SECTION 10.3. Amendment. (a) This Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Property Trustee, the Administrative Trustees and the Depositor, without the consent of any -51-
Securityholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Trust Agreement, which shall not be inconsistent with the other provisions of this Trust Agreement, or (ii) to modify, eliminate or add to any provisions of this Trust Agreement to such extent as shall be necessary to ensure that the Trust will be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not be taxable as a corporation at all times that any Trust Securities are outstanding or to ensure that the Trust will not be required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i) or clause (ii), such action shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Securityholder, provided, further, that any amendment described in this Section 10.3(a) made solely to conform this Trust Agreement to the final prospectus provided to investors in connection with the initial offering of the Capital Securities will not be deemed to adversely affect in any material respect the interests of the Securityholders. Any amendments of this Trust Agreement shall become effective when notice thereof is given to the Securityholders. (b) Except as provided in Section 10.3(c) hereof, any provision of this Trust Agreement may be amended by the Trustees and the Depositor with (i) the consent of Trust Securityholders representing not less than a majority (based upon Liquidation Amounts) of the Trust Securities then Outstanding and (ii) receipt by the Trustees of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the Trustees in accordance with such amendment will not affect the Trust's exemption from status of an investment company under the 1940 Act or the Trust's status as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes and will not result in the Trust being taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. (c) In addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Trust Agreement, other than the second proviso of the first sentence of Section 10.3(a), without the consent of each affected Securityholder (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.3 or 6.6 hereof), this Trust Agreement may not be amended to (i) change the amount or timing of any Distribution on the Trust Securities or otherwise adversely affect the amount of any Distribution required to be made in respect of the Trust Securities as of a specified date or (ii) restrict the right of a Securityholder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such date; notwithstanding any other provision herein, without the unanimous consent of the Securityholders (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.3 or 6.6 hereof), this paragraph (c) of this Section 10.3 may not be amended. (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Trust Agreement, no Trustee shall enter into or consent to any amendment to this Trust Agreement which would cause the Trust to (i) fail or cease to qualify for the exemption from status of an investment company under the 1940 Act, (ii) fail or cease to be classified as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes or (iii) be taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. -52-
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Trust Agreement to the contrary, other than in accordance with the second proviso of the first sentence of Section 10.3(a), without the consent of the Depositor, this Trust Agreement may not be amended in a manner which imposes any additional obligation on the Depositor. (f) In the event that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is made, the Administrative Trustees shall promptly provide to the Depositor a copy of such amendment. (g) Neither the Property Trustee nor the Delaware Trustee shall be required to enter into any amendment to this Trust Agreement which affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Trust Agreement. The Property Trustee shall be entitled to receive an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate stating that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is in compliance with this Trust Agreement. SECTION 10.4. Separability. In case any provision in this Trust Agreement or in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. SECTION 10.5. Governing Law. THIS TRUST AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OF THE SECURITYHOLDERS, THE TRUST AND THE TRUSTEES WITH RESPECT TO THIS TRUST AGREEMENT AND THE TRUST SECURITIES SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES). SECTION 10.6. Payments Due on Non-Business Day. If the date fixed for any payment on any Trust Security shall be a day that is not a Business Day, then such payment need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (except as otherwise provided in Sections 4.1(a) and 4.2(d)), with the same force and effect as though made on the date fixed for such payment, and no interest shall accrue thereon for the period after such date. SECTION 10.7. Successors. This Trust Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of any successor to the Depositor, the Trust or the Relevant Trustee, including any successor by operation of law.

In the event the Depositor takes action in violation of this -54-
Section 10.10, the Property Trustee agrees, for the benefit of Securityholders, that at the expense of the Depositor, it shall file an answer with the bankruptcy court or otherwise properly contest the filing of such petition by the Depositor against the Trust or the commencement of such action and raise the defense that the Depositor has agreed in writing not to take such action and should be stopped and precluded therefrom and such other defenses, if any, as counsel for the Trustee or the Trust may assert.

If any provision of this Trust Agreement modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Trust Agreement as so modified or excluded, as the case may be. (d) The application of the Trust Indenture Act to this Trust Agreement shall not affect the nature of the Trust Securities as equity securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. SECTION 10.12. Acceptance of Terms of Trust Agreement, Guarantee and Indenture. THE RECEIPT AND ACCEPTANCE OF A TRUST SECURITY OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN BY OR ON BEHALF OF A SECURITYHOLDER OR ANY BENEFICIAL OWNER, WITHOUT ANY SIGNATURE OR FURTHER MANIFESTATION OF ASSENT, SHALL CONSTITUTE THE UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE BY THE SECURITYHOLDER AND ALL OTHERS HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SUCH TRUST SECURITY OF ALL THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS TRUST AGREEMENT AND AGREEMENT TO THE SUBORDINATION PROVISIONS AND OTHER TERMS OF THE GUARANTEE AND THE INDENTURE, AND SHALL CONSTITUTE THE AGREEMENT OF THE TRUST, SUCH SECURITYHOLDER AND SUCH OTHERS THAT THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS TRUST AGREEMENT SHALL BE BINDING, OPERATIVE AND EFFECTIVE AS BETWEEN THE TRUST AND SUCH SECURITYHOLDER AND SUCH OTHERS. -55-

Section 3.2. Certain Rights of Guarantee Trustee. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1: (i) The Guarantee Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or presented by the proper party or parties.

Such legal counsel may be legal counsel to the Guarantor or any of its Affiliates and may be one of its employees. The Guarantee Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the administration of this Guarantee Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction. -7-
(v) The Guarantee Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Guarantee Agreement at the request or direction of any Holder, unless such Holder shall have provided to the Guarantee Trustee such adequate security and indemnity as would satisfy a reasonable person in the position of the Guarantee Trustee, against the costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) and liabilities that might be incurred by it in complying with such request or direction, including such reasonable advances as may be requested by the Guarantee Trustee; provided that, nothing contained in this Section 3.2(a)(v) shall be taken to relieve the Guarantee Trustee, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, of its obligation to exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Guarantee Agreement. (vi) The Guarantee Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Guarantee Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit.

(b) No provision of this Guarantee Agreement shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on the Guarantee Trustee to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which the Guarantee Trustee shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or authority available to the Guarantee Trustee shall be construed to be a duty to act in accordance with such power and authority. Section 3.3. Indemnity.

Section 5.2. Waiver of Notice and Demand. The Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of the Guarantee Agreement and any liability to which it applies or may apply, presentment, demand for payment, any right to require a proceeding first against the Guarantee Trustee, Issuer or any other Person before proceeding against the Guarantor, protest, notice of nonpayment, notice of dishonor, notice of redemption and all other notices and demands.

This Guarantee Agreement will not be discharged except by payment of the Guarantee Payments in full (without duplication of amounts theretofore paid by the Issuer) or upon distribution of Debentures to Holders as provided in the Trust Agreement. Section 5.6. Subrogation. The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all (if any) rights of the Holders against the Issuer in respect of any amounts paid to the Holders by the Guarantor under this Guarantee Agreement and shall have the right to waive payment by the Issuer pursuant to Section 5.1; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not (except to the extent required by mandatory provisions of law) be entitled to enforce or exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation or any indemnity, reimbursement or other agreement, in all cases as a result of payment under this Guarantee Agreement, if, at the time of any such payment, any amounts are due and unpaid under this Guarantee Agreement. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence, the Guarantor agrees to hold such amount in trust for the Holders and to pay over such amount to the Holders.

Section 6.2. Pari Passu Guarantees.
