EXHIBIT 99.1 FTNC Reports Record Earnings of $119.3 Million or $.92 Diluted Earnings Per Share for First Quarter 2004 MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 20, 2004--First Tennessee National Corporation (FTNC)(NYSE: FTN), which will be renamed First Horizon National Corporation pending shareholder approval at today's annual meeting, announced record earnings of $119.3 million, or $.92 diluted earnings per share for first quarter 2004. This compares to 2003's first quarter earnings of $119.0 million, or $.91 diluted earnings per share. "First quarter's excellent results were much as expected," said Chairman and CEO Ken Glass. "Our strong performance reflects a natural rebalancing of earnings within our business segments that happened as planned when the economy transitioned to a more normal operating environment. Also our national expansion initiatives continue to gain as we cross-sell and grow relationships with our customers. Our ability to report record earnings is a reflection of the strength of our strategic business mix." Return on average shareholders' equity and return on average assets were 25.6 percent and 1.93 percent, respectively for first quarter 2004 compared to 27.7 percent and 2.07 percent for first quarter 2003. Total assets were $27.1 billion, shareholders' equity was $1.9 billion and market capitalization was $6.0 billion on March 31, 2004, compared to $24.8 billion, $1.8 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, on March 31, 2003. PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Business Mix Transition Beneath the surface of the excellent first quarter earnings of $.92 per share, you'll notice an interesting and important planned transition. First Tennessee Banking Group continued the improvement which began in the fourth quarter, realizing a $17.7 million or 50 percent increase in pre-tax income over first quarter last year. That performance, along with the elimination of corporate discretionary spending of $14 million and a $4.1 million increase in transaction processing earnings, helped mitigate the expected decline in the two other major business lines. Although First Horizon Home Loans was down $26.9 million compared to last year's pre-tax earnings, which were favorably impacted by the peak in the refinancing boom, it still finished with strong first quarter earnings. FTN Financial was negatively impacted by market conditions, primarily customers remaining in cash positions, resulting in a $9.1 million drop-off from last year's first quarter. In total, the net of these impacts enabled earnings to remain relatively stable while share repurchases were the primary driver of the additional $.01 in earnings per share reported this quarter. National Expansion Strategies National expansion initiatives continue to grow rapidly, adding $26 million in revenues over last year's first quarter, an 81 percent growth rate. This revenue increase reflects 64 percent growth in the consumer lending portfolio and 50 percent growth in the construction lending portfolio. The national expansion strategy continues to produce strong results as cross-sell efforts, expansion of the sales force, and the recent opening of financial centers have successfully created rapid revenue growth from commercial banking products sold outside of Tennessee. Additionally three financial centers have been opened in Northern Virginia this quarter, and thus far have exceeded expectations. SEGMENT FINANCIALS First Horizon Pre-tax income for First Horizon decreased 23 percent to $91.5 million for first quarter 2004, compared to $118.4 million for first quarter 2003. Total revenues were $218.4 million in first quarter 2004, a decrease of 21 percent from $276.0 million in first quarter 2003. Net interest income increased 9 percent to $80.9 million in first quarter 2004 from $74.2 million in first quarter 2003. Net interest income on the consumer lending portfolio increased $16.4 million primarily due to an increase of 64 percent in the consumer lending portfolio, including home equity lines of credit and second liens, which averaged $4.8 billion in first quarter 2004 compared to $2.9 billion in first quarter 2003. Construction lending contributed $3.3 million to the growth in net interest income as the construction loan portfolio grew 50 percent to $.9 billion in first quarter 2004. Partially mitigating these increases was a decline in net interest income on loans held for sale (warehouse) reflecting the impact of a smaller warehouse, which decreased 24 percent on average to $3.1 billion in first quarter 2004 from $4.1 billion in first quarter 2003, and a lower net interest spread on the warehouse which was negatively impacted by lower mortgage rates compared to first quarter 2003. Noninterest income decreased 32 percent to $137.5 million in first quarter 2004 compared to $201.8 million in first quarter 2003. Noninterest income consists primarily of mortgage banking-related revenue, net of costs, from the origination and sale of mortgage loans, fees from mortgage servicing and mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net hedge gains or losses. Total noninterest income is net of amortization, impairment and other expenses related to MSR and related hedges. Mortgage loan origination volumes in first quarter 2004 were $7.0 billion compared to $11.5 billion in 2003. Given the industry-wide decline in refinance volume, the decrease in production volume was expected. However, home purchase related originations grew 22 percent from first quarter 2003, to $3.0 billion, demonstrating First Horizon's success in executing its strategy to grow the purchase market. Refinance activity represented 58 percent of total originations during first quarter 2004 compared to 79 percent last year. Loans securitized and sold into the secondary market decreased 44 percent to $6.4 billion as origination volume slowed. Net revenue from originating and selling mortgage loans (generally driven by origination volumes and loans securitized and sold) decreased 40 percent to $100.9 million compared to $169.1 million in first quarter 2003. Included in this quarter's net revenue from originating and selling real estate loans for first quarter 2004 are $5.0 million net gains from the securitization of approximately $300 million of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Successful cross-sell strategies through First Horizon's national delivery channels have resulted in rapid growth of HELOCs, and as capacity to fund additional HELOCs is needed, First Horizon will continue to securitize these loans on a periodic basis. The mortgage-servicing portfolio was $70.3 billion on March 31, 2004, an increase of 21 percent compared to $58.2 billion on March 31, 2003. Total fees associated with mortgage servicing increased 20 percent to $54.4 million due to the growth in the servicing portfolio and the favorable impact of lower prepayment activity. Servicing fees were negatively impacted by a lower level of GNMA mortgages, which earn higher servicing fees. Additionally, as a result of this growth in the servicing portfolio, servicing costs were reduced 21 percent to $62 per loan. MSR amortization was $34.0 million for first quarter 2004 compared with $31.1 million in first quarter 2003. In first quarter 2004 MSR impairment losses decreased to $14.6 million compared to a $42.5 million loss in first quarter 2003 but were mitigated in part by decreased net MSR hedging gains (including the effect of time decay) of $21.3 million in first quarter 2004 compared to $37.3 million net gains in first quarter 2003. This positive net change was brought about by the interest rate environment in first quarter 2004 versus 2003 which also resulted in 40 percent lower servicing portfolio prepayments. The provision for loan losses was $3.7 million in first quarter 2004 compared to $11.8 million in first quarter 2003. The decline in provision reflects a positive change that is related to improvement in the risk profile of the retail loan portfolio. The risk profile improved as the mix of the loan portfolio shifted to a greater concentration of high credit score products. Also impacting the provision in first quarter 2003 was the transfer of certain higher risk residential mortgage loans to held for sale which created an unfavorable impact of $3.1 million. Additionally, the decline in provision reflects the substantial resolution in 2003 of a credit loss related to a large real estate project. Noninterest expense decreased 15 percent in first quarter 2004 to $123.2 million compared to $145.8 million in first quarter 2003. In first quarter 2004, noninterest expense was favorably impacted by a decline in losses on foreclosed real estate and by a reduction in contract employment expense. However, expenses associated with the expansion of First Horizon Bank into Northern Virginia reduced these favorable impacts. Also impacting the decline was a loss of $14 million in first quarter 2003 associated with the termination of a lease arrangement with a single-purpose entity for First Horizon's main office headquarters. Going forward, revenue from refinance loan originations will generally depend on mortgage interest rates. Over time, an increase in rates should reduce origination fees and profit from the sale of loans, but should also reduce MSR amortization expense and impairment losses, while a decrease in rates should increase this net revenue. Flat to rising interest rates should reduce net secondary marketing trading gains, while falling rates should increase this net revenue. If total origination volume increases and/or the yield curve steepens, net interest income from the warehouse should increase, while if volume decreases and/or the yield curve flattens, this revenue should decrease. Continued success in national cross-sell strategies should continue to increase revenues from products other than traditional mortgage origination and servicing. In addition, third party agreements are expected to add on average approximately $150 million of consumer loan origination volume on a quarterly basis in 2004. First Tennessee Banking Group Pre-tax income for First Tennessee Banking Group increased 50 percent to $53.2 million for first quarter 2004, compared to $35.5 million for first quarter 2003. First National Bank of Springdale (FNBS), which was divested on December 31, 2003, contributed $1.3 million to pre-tax income in first quarter 2003. The impact of this divestiture did not significantly affect the current year's growth rates and the impact on the corporation's earnings per share was mitigated by the repurchase of common stock. Total revenues increased 6 percent to $187.7 million for first quarter 2004 compared to $177.6 million for first quarter 2003. Net interest income was $105.1 million in first quarter 2004 compared to $104.5 million in first quarter 2003. FNBS contributed $3.0 million to net interest income in 2003. The increase in 2004's net interest income is primarily attributable to 8 percent loan growth which was partially funded by an increase in core deposits of 3 percent. Noninterest income increased 13 percent in first quarter 2004 to $82.6 million compared to $73.1 million in first quarter 2003. The increase in noninterest income demonstrates the success of various strategies to grow revenue streams including a 15 percent increase in insurance premiums and commissions, a 29 percent increase in wealth management revenue, and 4 percent increases in both deposit service charges and trust services and investment management revenue. The provision for loan losses decreased to $9.7 million in first quarter 2004 from $16.0 million last year primarily due to improvements in the risk profile of both the retail and commercial loan portfolios. The risk profile of the retail portfolio improved as the mix shifted to a greater concentration of high credit score products. The risk profile of the commercial loan portfolio improved as indicated by current lower levels of watch and classified loans. Going forward the level of provision for loan losses should fluctuate primarily with the strength or weakness of the Tennessee economy. Noninterest expense was $124.8 million in first quarter 2004 compared to $126.1 million last year. In 2003, approximately $7 million of expense was due to discretionary investing in cost savings initiatives and revenue enhancing activities. The remaining increase in 2004, excluding discretionary investing, was due to higher personnel costs which were largely attributable to commissions and incentives paid for growth in product-related revenues and due to expenses associated with expansion efforts in the Middle Tennessee market. FTN Financial Pre-tax income for FTN Financial decreased 20 percent to $37.2 million for first quarter 2004, compared to $46.3 million for first quarter 2003. Total revenues decreased 15 percent to $128.5 million from $151.0 million in first quarter 2003. Noninterest income decreased 16 percent in first quarter 2004 to $119.7 million from $141.9 million in first quarter 2003. This decline in revenue reflects the impact that the changing environment had on demand for FTN Financial's products and services as the customer base purchased less fixed income securities due to less cash flow from prepayments, increased loan demand on depository institutions as the economy began to recover, and temporary delays in investment decisions in anticipation of higher interest rates. As a result, depository institutions had the most significant decline of 29 percent driving revenue contribution from 47 percent to 39 percent. Revenues from non-depository institutions proved to be more stable, declining only 12 percent and were 26 percent of revenue compared to 25 percent in 2003. Other revenues sources, which include investment banking, equity research and sales, correspondent services and portfolio advisory services increased 5 percent and contributed 35 percent of revenue. Noninterest expense decreased 14 percent in first quarter 2004 to $90.5 million from $105.0 million in first quarter 2003. This decline was due to a decrease of 19 percent in personnel expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, resulting from lower commissions and incentives associated with the reduced fee income this year. Going forward, revenues will fluctuate based on factors which include the expansion or contraction of customer demand for fixed income products which can be influenced by the strength of loan growth in the U.S. economy and volatility in the interest rate environment and equity markets. Also impacting revenue is the volume of investment banking transactions and the continued broadening of product offerings. The regulatory environment can also impact FTN Financial's performance as demonstrated by the current debate over the regulatory capital treatment of trust preferred securities that have been deconsolidated under FIN 46. If the regulators eventually decide to disallow trust preferred securities as Tier I regulatory capital, demand for this product may diminish and, exclusive of any alternative product that may be designed to replace it, the negative impact to FTNC's earnings for the remainder of 2004 could be in the range of $.08 to $.12 per share. The impact on 2004 would be lessened if the implementation of any disallowance is delayed to later in the year or a redesigned product attains Tier I capital classification. Transaction Processing Pre-tax income for Transaction Processing increased 98 percent to $8.4 million for first quarter 2004, compared to $4.3 million for first quarter 2003. Total revenues were $34.1 million in first quarter 2004, an increase of 15 percent from $29.8 million in first quarter 2003. Merchant revenues increased 47 percent in first quarter 2004 due to acquisitions and limited recovery in the hospitality industry as transactions processed increased 21 percent. Also impacting merchant revenues was a divestiture gain of $2.0 million resulting from an earn-out on the fourth quarter 2003 sale of certain merchant relationships. Express processing revenues decreased 11 percent as the volume of transactions processed for customers declined 13 percent due in part to a diminishing market with customer conversion from check to electronic bill payments and the loss of two large customers due to continued pricing pressures. Noninterest expense in first quarter 2004 was $25.7 million compared to $25.5 million in first quarter 2003. Corporate The Corporate segment's results showed a pre-tax loss of $10.1 million in first quarter 2004, compared to a pre-tax loss of $22.6 million in first quarter 2003. First quarter 2003's pre-tax loss included approximately $14 million of expense related to discretionary investing in cost savings initiatives. AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET Total average assets increased 7 percent to $24.9 billion for first quarter 2004. Total loans increased 22 percent to $14.0 billion as retail loans increased 34 percent and commercial loans grew 8 percent. Loans held for sale decreased 21 percent to $3.3 billion. Interest-bearing core deposits increased 1 percent to $5.9 billion. Total core deposits decreased 2 percent due to lower mortgage escrow balances, while First Tennessee Banking Group increased 3 percent. Purchased funds increased 14 percent to $9.9 billion. Average shareholders' equity increased 8 percent in first quarter 2004. (See A-14 for additional information on the balance sheet impact of certain transactions and new accounting standards.) The consolidated net interest margin decreased to 3.68 percent for first quarter 2004 compared to 3.98 percent for first quarter 2003, primarily due to the repricing of assets to lower yields while liability rates have become less sensitive to rate movements and due to a change in the mix of the loan portfolio to a higher percentage of floating rate products. The warehouse also depressed the margin as net interest spread on the warehouse was negatively impacted by lower mortgage rates compared to first quarter 2003. Investment yields declined as accelerated prepayments of investments in mortgage-backed securities in 2003 were reinvested at lower rates. In the near-term, a decline in prepayment volume and a slowdown in the repricing of the commercial and retail loan portfolios coupled with steps management has taken to manage the interest rate sensitivity position of the company should result in a more stable net interest margin (see A-11). Over the long-term, FTNC's strategies to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet position should allow the net interest margin to remain stable when interest rates rise. ASSET QUALITY Net charge-offs decreased to $11.8 million in first quarter 2004 compared to $27.3 million in first quarter 2003. Net charge-offs were impacted in first quarter 2004 by improvement in both the consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Nonperforming assets were $77.5 million on March 31, 2004, compared to $78.4 million on March 31, 2003. Provision for loan losses decreased to $14.2 million in first quarter 2004 compared to $27.5 million in first quarter 2003. The improvement in first quarter 2004's provision is related to the positive shift in the mix of the loan portfolio. The risk profile of the retail loan portfolio improved as the mix shifted to a greater concentration of high credit score products. Also impacting the risk profile of this portfolio was the transfer of certain higher risk residential mortgage loans to held for sale in 2003. The decline in provision also reflects the substantial resolution in 2003 of a credit loss related to a large real estate project. The risk profile of the commercial loan portfolio improved as indicated by current lower levels of watch and classified loans. An analytical model based on historical loss experience adjusted for current events, trends and economic conditions is used by management to determine the amount of provision to be recognized and to assess the adequacy of the loan loss allowance. (See the table on A-9 for an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and details on nonperforming assets and the table on A-10 for asset quality ratios). OTHER INFORMATION Further Interpretations of SFAS No. 133 In March 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 105 (SAB No. 105), "Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments". SAB No. 105 prohibits the inclusion of estimated servicing cash flows and internally-developed intangible assets within the valuation of interest rate lock commitments under SFAS No. 133. SAB No. 105 is effective for disclosures and interest rate lock commitments initiated after March 31, 2004. FTNC currently includes a portion of the value of the associated servicing cash flows when recognizing loan commitments at inception and throughout its life. The adoption of SAB No. 105 will result in a one-time, before tax earnings decrease of approximately $10 million in second quarter 2004. However, the ongoing economic value of this business is not affected. Other This press release contains forward-looking statements involving significant risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking information.

A-13 FIRST TENNESSEE NATIONAL CORPORATION OTHER HIGHLIGHTS (Unaudited) Effective July 1, 2003, FTNC adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," and classified its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary ($45.1 million on July 1, 2003) as term borrowings. As required by SFAS No. 150 prior periods were not restated. In prior years, FTNC has securitized certain real estate loans through a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC) and retained all of the securitized assets. The retained assets were classified on the Consolidated Statements of Condition in "Securities held to maturity." During fourth quarter 2003, FTNC elected to purchase all of the mortgage loans remaining in the REMIC ($136.3 million at repurchase). Subsequent to the repurchase of the mortgage loans, these assets are classified as retail real estate residential loans. Effective December 31, 2003, FTNC adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," and deconsolidated its subsidiary, First Tennessee Capital I (Capital I), which has issued $100.0 million of capital securities that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by FTNC. As a result of this deconsolidation the capital securities are no longer included on FTNC's balance sheet. However, $103.0 million of junior subordinated debentures issued by FTNC to Capital I are no longer eliminated in consolidation and appear in term borrowings as of December 31, 2003. On December 31, 2003, FTNC completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its wholly owned subsidiary, First National Bank of Springdale (FNB) of Springdale, Arkansas to First Security Bank of Searcy, Arkansas. This transaction resulted in a divestiture gain of $12.5 million. Immediately preceding the sale, FNB had investment securities of approximately $125 million, loans of approximately $165 million, deposits of approximately $300 million and equity of approximately $40 million.
