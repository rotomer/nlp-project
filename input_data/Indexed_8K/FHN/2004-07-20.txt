EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., July 20, 2004 (PRIMEZONE) -- First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE:FHN), formerly First Tennessee National Corporation, announced today four new financial reporting segments: Retail/Commercial Banking, Mortgage Banking, Capital Markets and Corporate. FHN formerly reported five segments by primary brand: First Horizon, First Tennessee Banking Group, FTN Financial, Transaction Processing and Corporate. By realigning the segments along similar operations and industry classifications, the underlying business mix and growth opportunities of each of the segments are more transparent.
"This new segmentation reflects the diverse national financial services company First Horizon is today," said Ken Glass, chairman and CEO of First Horizon. "Our national expansion strategy is picking up momentum as we have enhanced our ability to generate cross-selling opportunities with targeted customers across all of our business segments. We are pleased with our progress and believe we are uniquely positioned for continued success."
The four segments, along with their operating profiles, are outlined below:
Retail/Commercial Banking
Retail/Commercial Banking consists of deposit taking, commercial and consumer lending, investments, insurance, financial planning, trust services, asset management, credit card, cash management, transaction processing and correspondent services. Retail/Commercial Banking now includes portfolio lending activities such as equity lending and construction loans originated by First Horizon Home Loans which were previously in the First Horizon segment.
There are 194 full-service financial centers in Tennessee, Virginia and Mississippi and more than 500 ATMs providing our "All Things Financial" strategy to six metro areas. Consumer lending activities have been offered to all qualifying mortgage origination customers in the 42 states we serve nationwide. As a result, consumer loans have been growing 29 percent over the last two years. Additionally, commercial construction lending activities have been growing 22 percent as we have expanded into 25 metropolitan areas across the country. Wealth management and small business lending centers have begun their national expansion initiatives, reaching 12 and eight markets respectively. Continued growth in these initiatives will enable First Horizon to continue to serve more metropolitan markets with full-service financial centers each year and to reach dozens of markets with specialized sales forces.
Retail/Commercial Banking activities generated $274 million in revenues during the first quarter, representing 48 percent of First Horizon's total revenues and $89 million in pre-tax income, representing 50 percent of First Horizon's earnings.
Mortgage Banking
Mortgage Banking primarily consists of first lien mortgage originations and servicing. Additional activities related to the mortgage banking business include fees from appraisals, inspections, captive reinsurance, federal flood insurance, property tax payment service, credit report scoring services, and early GNMA buyout income. First Horizon Home Loans operates in 40 states across the country through approximately 1,800 relationship managers in 245 offices.
Mortgage Banking activities generated $163 million in revenues during the first quarter, representing 29 percent of First Horizon's total revenues and $62 million in pre-tax income, representing 34 percent of First Horizon's earnings.
Capital Markets
Capital Markets is a full-service brokerage operation focused on institutional investors. Traditionally, depository institutions have composed the majority of our customer base; however, recently mutual funds, municipalities, foundations and other money managers have become an increasingly larger percentage of the business. Revenues from other fee sources includes fee income from activities such as investment banking, equity research, portfolio advisory and the sale of Bank Owned Life Insurance. Capital Markets has offices in Memphis, New York, Chicago, Boston, Charlotte, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Dallas, Mobile, Kansas City, Cleveland and Nashville.
Capital Markets activities generated $120 million in revenues during the first quarter, representing 21 percent of First Horizon's total revenues and $31 million in pre-tax income, representing 17 percent of First Horizon's earnings.
Corporate
Corporate consists of executive management, enterprise-wide risk management, corporate finance, corporate communications and legal. Additionally, this segment now includes the funding function for the corporation and any impact from balance sheet positioning.
Corporate activities generated $11 million in expenses during the first quarter, representing 3 percent of First Horizon's total expenses and $2 million in net pre-tax loss.
