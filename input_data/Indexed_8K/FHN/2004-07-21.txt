Balance Sheet:
Effective July 1, 2003, FHN adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity", and classified its mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of subsidiary ($45.1 million on July 1, 2003) as term borrowings.  As required by SFAS No. 150 prior periods were not restated.
In prior years, FHN has securitized certain real estate loans through a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC) and retained all of the securitized assets.  The retained assets were classified on the Consolidated Statements of Condition in "Securities held to maturity".   During fourth quarter 2003, FHN elected to purchase all of the mortgage loans remaining in the REMIC ($136.3 million at repurchase).  Subsequent to the repurchase of the mortgage loans, these assets are classified as retail real estate residential loans.
Effective December 31, 2003, FHN adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities", and deconsolidated its subsidiary, First Tennessee Capital I (Capital I), which has issued $100.0 million of capital securities that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by FHN.  As a result of this deconsolidation the capital securities are no longer included on FHN's balance sheet.  However, $103.0 million of junior subordinated debentures issued by FHN to Capital I are no longer eliminated in consolidation and appear in term borrowings as of December 31, 2003.
On December 31, 2003, FHN completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its wholly owned subsidiary, First National Bank of Springdale (FNB) of Springdale, Arkansas to First Security Bank of Searcy, Arkansas.  This transaction resulted in a divestiture gain of $12.5 million.  Immediately preceding the sale, FNB had investment securities of approximately $125 million, loans of approximately $165 million, deposits of approximately $300 million and equity of approximately $40 million.
