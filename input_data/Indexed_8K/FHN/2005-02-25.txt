ITEM 2.03.
  
CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
(a) On February 18, 2005, the registrant and its subsidiary First Tennessee Bank National Association (the "Bank") entered into a $5 billion bank note program (the "Note Program") with Goldman Sachs & Co., FTN Financial Securities Corp., and Credit Suisse First Boston (the "Agents") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as fiscal and paying agent and interest calculation agent. The primary legal contracts which govern the Note Program are filed as exhibits to this Current Report.
 
The Note Program provides the Bank with a facility under which it may continuously issue and offer short and medium term unsecured notes having maturities of 30 days or more. The Note Program allows the Bank to have up to $5 billion in principal amount of notes outstanding under the Program at any one time; however, under the Note Program, the Bank may not issue in the aggregate more than $5 billion in principal amount of notes having terms in excess of 270 days. The Note Program replaces an existing $3 billion program under which the Bank had nearly exhausted its ability to issue and sell longer-term notes. The old program has been terminated in connection with the establishment of the new Note Program. That termination does not affect any previously-issued notes outstanding under the old program.
 
Net proceeds from the notes are expected to be used by the Bank for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of its business.
 
The Note Program does not commit the Bank to issue any particular amount of notes with any particular terms. The registrant intends for the Note Program to provide the Bank with substantial flexibility in structuring various types of notes that may be issued and sold under the Program from time to time. Notes are to be issued in $250,000 minimum denominations to accredited institutional investors. Notes may bear interest at fixed or floating rates, or may pay no interest at all. Floating rate notes may pay interest based on any of several specified indices plus or minus a spread and/or multiplied by a spread multiplier. Notes may be issued at a discount from their redemption amounts. Notes may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Notes may provide for payments of principal, interest, or premium to be indexed by reference to the price of specified commodities or securities or currencies. Notes may provide for early redemption at the election of the Bank or the holder, or may provide the holder with the right to extend the maturity.
 
Notes may be issued singly or in series. The Note Program restricts the Bank's right to offer notes through other agents, but (among other exceptions) Bank has reserved certain rights to offer notes without the assistance of the Agents and to offer notes through other agents on a non-continuous, firmly-underwritten basis. Commissions to be paid to the Agents may be negotiated for each notes issuance and are expected to vary with the maturity of the notes involved, among other things. A note or note series may, but need not be, subject to a separately negotiated "Terms Agreement."

Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Bank and the Holding Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Bank or the Holding Company may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Offering Circular as amended or supplemented, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Offering Circular as amended or supplemented in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Bank by such Agent expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Bank and the Holding Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Bank or the Holding Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c)
               
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.No indemnifying party shall without the written consent of the indemnified party effect the settlement or compromise of or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnifi ed party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission or fault culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
 
(d)
              
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result or such losses claims damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
received by the Bank and the Holding Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss claim damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates.If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Bank and the Holding Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses claims damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.The relative benefits received by the Bank and the Holding Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Bank bear to the total commissions or discounts received by such Agent in respect thereof.The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Bank or the Holding Company on the one hand or by any Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.The Bank, the Holding Company and each Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method or allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), an Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total offering price at which the Securities purchased by or through it were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.The obligations of each of the Agents under this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint.

The procedures to be followed with respect to the settlement of sales of Securities directly by the Bank to purchasers solicited by an Agent, as agent, are set forth below.The terms and settlement details related to a purchase of Securities by an Agent, as principal, from the Bank will be set forth in a Terms Agreement pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, unless the Bank and such Agent otherwise agree as provided in Section 3(b) of the Distribution Agreement, in which case the procedures to be followed in respect of the settlement of such sale will be as set forth below.An Agent, in relation to a purchase of a Security by a purchaser solicited by such Agent, is referred to herein as the "Selling Agent" and, in relation to a purchase of a Security by such Agent as principal other than pursuant to a Terms Agreement, as the "Purchasing Agent".< /p>
 
 
The Bank will advise each Agent in writing of those persons with whom such Agent is to communicate regarding offers to purchase Securities and the related settlement details.
Each Security will be issued only in fully registered form and will be represented by a global security (a "Global Security") delivered to the Fiscal and Paying Agent, as agent for The Depository Trust Company (the "Depositary") and recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary (a "Book-Entry Security").Owners of beneficial interests in Global Securities will be entitled to physical delivery of Securities in certificated form (a "Certificated Security") equal in principal amount to their respective beneficial interests only in certain limited circumstances described in the Offering Circular.

Date of Settlement:
The receipt by the Bank of immediately available funds in payment for a Security and the authentication and issuance of the Global Security representing such Security shall constitute "settlement" with respect to such Security.All orders of Securities solicited by a Selling Agent or made by a Purchasing Agent and accepted by the Bank on a particular date (the "Trade Date") will be settled on a date (the "Settlement Date") which is the third Business Day after the Trade Date pursuant to the "Settlement Procedure Timetable" set forth below, unless the Bank and the purchaser agree to settlement on another Business Day which shall be no earlier than the next Business Day after the Trade Date.
 
Settlement Procedure Timetable
For orders of Securities solicited by a Selling Agent and accepted by the Bank for settlement on the third Business Day after the Trade Date, Settlement Procedures "A" through "I" set forth above shall be completed as soon as possible but not later than the respective times (New York City time) set forth below:
 
If the initial interest rate for a Floating Rate Security has not been determined at the time that Settlement Procedure "A" is completed Settlement Procedures "B" and "C" shall be completed as soon as such rate has been determined but no later than 2:00 p.m. on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date.Settlement Procedure "H" is subject to extension in accordance with any extension of Fedwire closing deadlines and in the other events specified in the SDFS operating procedures in effect on the Settlement Date
 
If settlement of a Security is rescheduled or canceled, the Fiscal and Paying Agent, upon obtaining knowledge thereof, will deliver to the Depositary, through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System, a cancellation message to such effect by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Settlement Date.
Failure to Settle:
If the Fiscal and Paying Agent fails to enter an SDFS deliver order with respect to a Security pursuant to Settlement Procedure "F," the Fiscal and Paying Agent may deliver to the Depositary, through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System, as soon as practicable a withdrawal message instructing the Depositary to debit such Security to the Fiscal and Paying Agent's participant account, provided that the Fiscal and Paying Agent's participant account contains a principal amount of the Global Security representing such Security that is at least equal to the principal amount to be debited.If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to all the Securities represented by a Global Security, the Fiscal and Paying Agent will mark such
 
Global Security "canceled," make appropriate entries in the Fiscal and Paying Agent's records and send such canceled Global Security to the Bank.The CUSIP number assigned to such Global Security shall, in accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau procedures, be canceled and not immediately reassigned.If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Securities represented by a Global Security, the Fiscal and Paying Agent will exchange such Global Security for two Global Securities, one of which shall represent such Security or Securities and shall be canceled immediately after issuance and the other of which shall represent the remaining Securities previously represented by the surrendered Global Security and shall bear the CUSIP number of the surrendered Global Security.
 
 
If the purchase price for any Security is not timely paid to the participants with respect to such Security by the beneficial purchaser thereof (or a person, including an indirect participant in the Depositary, acting on behalf of such purchaser), such participants and, in turn, the Agent for such Security may enter deliver orders through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System debiting such Security to such participant's account and crediting such Security to such Agent's account and then debiting such Security to such Agent's participant account and crediting such Security to the Fiscal and Paying Agent's participant account and shall notify the Bank and the Fiscal and Paying Agent thereof.Thereafter, the Fiscal and Paying Agent will (i) immediately notify the Bank of such order and the Bank shall transfer to such Agent funds available for immediate use in an amount equal to th e price of such Security which was credited to the account of the Bank maintained at the Fiscal and Paying Agent in accordance with Settlement Procedure I, and (ii) deliver the withdrawal message and take the related actions described in the preceding paragraph.If such failure shall have occurred for any reason other than default by the applicable Agent to perform its obligations hereunder or under the Distribution Agreement, the Bank will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for the loss of its use of funds during the period when the funds were credited to the account of the Bank.
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any failure to settle with respect to a Security, the Depositary may take any actions in accordance with its SDFS operating procedures then in effect.In the event of a failure to settle with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Securities to have been represented by a Global Security, the Fiscal and Paying Agent will provide, in accordance with Settlement Procedure "D," for the authentication and issuance of a Global Security representing the other Securities to have been represented by such Global Security and will make appropriate entries in its records.The Bank will, from time to time, furnish the Fiscal and Paying Agent with a sufficient quantity of Securities.

          Except as set forth above or specified on the face hereof or in an Addendum hereto, the interest rate in effect on each day shall be (a) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date or (b) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date immediately preceding the most recent Interest Reset Date.If any Interest Reset Date (which term includes the term Initial Interest Reset Date unless the context otherwise requires) would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that if an Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is LIBOR and such next Business Day fa lls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.In addition, if the Treasury Rate is an applicable Interest Rate Basis and the Interest Determination Date would otherwise fall on an Interest Reset Date, then such Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day.
 
 
          Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, interest payable on this Note on any Interest Payment Date shall be the amount of interest accrued from and including the next preceding Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest has been paid (or from and including the Original Issue Date specified on the face hereof, if no interest has been paid), to but excluding the related Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date or date of earlier redemption or repayment, as the case may be.
          Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, accrued interest hereon shall be an amount calculated by multiplying the principal amount hereof by an accrued interest factor.Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated.Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the interest factor for each such day shall be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360 if the CD Rate, the Commercial Paper Rate, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, the J.J. Kenny Rate, LIBOR or the Prime Rate is an applicable Interest Rate Basis or by the actual number of days in the year if the CMT Rate or the Treasury Rate is an applicable Interest Rate Basis.If interest on this Note is to be calculated with reference to two or more Interest Rate Bases as specified on the face hereof, the interest factor will be calculated in each period in the same manner as if only one of the applicable Interest Rate Bases applied.
 
 
 
          The interest rate applicable to each day in an Interest Reset Period commencing on the related Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (as defined below) and will be calculated by the Calculation Agent on or prior to the Calculation Date (as defined below), except with respect to LIBOR, which will be calculated on such Interest Determination Date.Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the "Interest Determination Date" with

          Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the "Calculation Date" pertaining to any Interest Determination Date will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day and (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date or date of earlier redemption or repayment as the case may be.All calculations on this Note shall be made by the Calculation Agent specified on the face hereof or such successor thereto as is duly appointed by the Bank and shall be final and binding absent manifest error.
 
          All percentages resulting from any calculation on this Note will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or 0.09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or 0.0987655) and 9.876544% (or 0.09876544) would be rounded to 9.87654% (or 0.0987654)), and all amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded, in the case of U.S. dollars to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to the smallest denominational unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).
          As used herein, "Business Day" means, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that in The City of New York or in Memphis, Tennessee is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close and, if an Interest Rate Basis shown on the face hereof is LIBOR, is also a London Banking Day.

Determination of CD Rate
 
          In the event that the above rate is not published prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to that CD Rate Interest Determination Date, then the CD Rate shall be the rate on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date set forth in H.15 Daily Update (as hereinafter defined), or another recognized electronic source, used for the purpose of displaying that rate, for that day in respect of certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Note under the caption "CDs (secondary market)".
          If by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date the CD Rate is not yet published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, the CD Rate for that CD Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates, as of 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading nonbank dealers of negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major U.S. money market banks for negotiable certificates of deposit with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified in the applicable Note in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time.
          If fewer than three dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as set forth above, the CD Rate will be the CD Rate in effect on that CD Rate Interest Determination Date.

CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the yield for U.S. Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity and for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities."If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate for the period of the Index Maturity as may then be published by either the Federal Reserve Board or the U.S. Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate which would otherwise have been published in H.15(519).If the Federal Reserve Board or the U.S. Department of the Treasury does not publish a yield on U.S. Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Ma turity for such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading primary U.S. government securities dealers in The City of New York (which may include one or more of the Agents or their affiliates) (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)) for U.S. Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Maturity, a remaining term to maturity no more than 1 year shorter than the Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time.If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated.If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of e quality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)) for U.S. Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity, a remaining term to maturity closest to the Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time.If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.If two such U.S. Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Index Maturity, the quotes for the Treasury security with the shorter original term to maturity will be used.
 
 
 
 
  
 
          (ii)If "CMT Moneyline Telerate Page 7052" is the specified CMT Moneyline Telerate Page on the face hereof, the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for U.S. Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury constant maturities," as such yield is displayed on Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) on page 7052 (or any other page as may replace such page on such service) ("Moneyline Telerate Page 7052") for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date fal ls.If such rate does not appear on the Moneyline Telerate Page 7052, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be a percentage equal to the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for U.S. Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity and for the week or month, as applicable, preceding such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date as set forth in H.15(519) opposite the caption "Treasury constant maturities."If such rate does not appear in H.15(519), the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield for U.S. Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity as otherwise announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applic able, in which such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls.If the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not publish a one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof, average yield on U.S. Treasury securities at "constant maturity" having the Index Maturity for the applicable week or month, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices at approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)) for U.S. Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Index Mat urity, a remaining term to maturity of no more than 1 year shorter than the Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in such securities in such market at such time.If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated.If fewer than three prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of thre e Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)) for U.S. Treasury securities with an original maturity longer than the Index Maturity, a remaining term to maturity closest to the Index Maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single
       
 
 
 
 
 
transaction in such securities in such market at such time.If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the rate on the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations shall be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three such prices are provided as requested, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date shall be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date.If two U.S. Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Index Maturity have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Index Maturity, the quotes for the Treasury security w ith the shorter original term to maturity will be used.
 
 
          .If an Interest Rate Basis for this Note is the Commercial Paper Rate, as indicated on the face hereof, the Commercial Paper Rate shall be determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date"), as the Money Market Yield (as hereinafter defined) on such date of the rate for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519) under the caption "Commercial paper-Nonfinancial" or, if not so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the Money Market Yield of the rate on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in H.15 Daily Update (as hereinafter de fined), or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Commercial paper-Nonfinancial."If such rate is not yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in The City of New York (which may include one or more of the Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for industrial issuers whose bond rating is "Aa," or the equ ivalent, from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; , , that if the dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate determined as of such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date will be the Commercial Paper Rate in effect on such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date.
