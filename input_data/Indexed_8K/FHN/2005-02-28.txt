ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On February 22, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the registrant took certain actions which resulted in the grant, creation, or supplement of the following compensatory agreements or arrangements with executive officers of the registrant: Performance Accelerated Restricted Stock Award Program (PARSAP) (formerly known as TARSAP) Acting under authority delegated to it under the 1992 Restricted Stock Incentive Plan (which was shareholder-approved), the Committee provided that a portion of PARSAP shares having the 2002-2004 performance period be withheld by the registrant to the extent necessary to cover withholding taxes related to vesting of such awards. In addition, the Committee provided that all or a portion of PARSAP shares related to the 2002-2004 performance period be deferred to the extent necessary to comport with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) Awards Acting under authority delegated to it under the 2003 Equity Compensation Plan (which was shareholder-approved), the Committee combined two years of the 2004 LTIP awards (with a performance period of 2004-2006) with the 2005 LTIP awards. In connection with that action, the Committee limited the amount payable under the 2004 LTIP to a single-year amount and granted 2005 LTIP awards with both a two-year performance period (2005- 2006) and a three-year performance period (2005-2007). Salary and Annual Bonus Action The Committee approved the salaries for the executive officers of the Company related to the year 2005, which range from $221,000 to $916,000. The Committee approved annual cash bonuses of the executive officers of the Company for 2004: J. Kenneth Glass ($285,000), Gerald L. Baker ($3,651,241), Charles G. Burkett ($535,000), Jim L. Hughes ($3,455,000), and Larry Martin ($100,000). The Committee established target payouts and performance criteria for 2005 annual cash bonuses under the shareholder-approved 2002 Management Incentive Plan (MIP). For the executive officers other than the line business unit heads (Gerald L. Baker, Charles G. Burkett, Jim L. Hughes, and Larry Martin), target bonuses were established ranging from 60% to 125% of base salary, and maximum bonuses are 150% of target. The primary criterion for determining final bonuses will be earnings per share growth for 2005. For the line business unit heads, bonuses were established as a percentage of a measure of applicable business unit pretax income, all in accordance with existing arrangements. Pursuant to Instruction B.4. to Form 8-K and applicable regulations and releases, forms of documents, and descriptions of arrangements, related to the foregoing will be filed as exhibits to the registrant's next Form 10-K.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
