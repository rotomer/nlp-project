Exhibit 99.1
First Horizon National Corporation Reports Financial Results for First Quarter 2006
MEMPHIS, Tenn., April. 19, 2006 (PRIMEZONE) -- First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE:FHN) announced first quarter 2006 earnings of $215.0 million or $1.67 per diluted share. In 2005, first quarter earnings were $105.8 million or $.83 per diluted share. FHN's performance in first quarter 2006 was impacted by transactions through which the incremental capital provided by the merchant divestiture was utilized, various other transactions and accounting issues.
The two most important of these transactions were a gain realized on the consummation of the previously announced sale of FHN's national merchant processing business and securities losses incurred in connection with a restructuring of the investment portfolio undertaken in view of the current interest rate environment.
Business operations reflected continued strong growth within Retail/Commercial Banking, growth in Capital Markets revenues, and a decline in Mortgage Banking related to a tightening in the overall mortgage market. Retail/Commercial Banking experienced 24 percent growth in loans and an 11 percent increase in deposits. While Capital Markets revenues were only up 2 percent as compared to the first quarter of 2005, these revenues experienced an 18 percent increase on a sequential quarter basis. Since the first quarter of 2005, Mortgage Banking originations have fallen 10 percent; however, the expected decline for the industry is 17 percent. Mortgage Banking earnings were also unfavorably impacted by hedge performance this quarter.
"Although numerous factors may make it difficult to understand our underlying performance this quarter, we are convinced that the actions we are taking will position us well for the future," said Ken Glass, Chairman and CEO of FHN, "We believe it is essential to be proactive in responding to changing market conditions and circumstances. That's why we are selling the merchant business and using the proceeds from that sale to implement various transactions including buying back our shares and restructuring our balance sheet, which create immediate value for our shareholders."
Comparisons between reported earnings are directly and significantly affected by a number of factors that were present in first quarter 2006 but not present (or present to a much lesser degree) in first quarter 2005. The following discussion highlights these items:
The results for first quarter 2006 included earnings from discontinued operations of $210.3 million or $1.63 per diluted share related to the sale of the merchant processing business. In first quarter 2005 earnings from discontinued merchant operations were $3.0 million or $.03 per diluted share. On March 1, 2006, FHN sold its national merchant processing business for an after-tax gain of $208 million. This divestiture was accounted for as a discontinued operation, and accordingly, current and prior periods were adjusted to exclude the impact of merchant operations from the results of continuing operations.
In first quarter 2006, FHN purchased 4 million shares of its common stock through an accelerated share repurchase program for an initial purchase price of approximately $158 million. The final settlement, after the repurchase period, is expected to occur in second quarter 2006. The benefit of this share repurchase, which occurred near the end of the quarter, was not fully realized in first quarter as average shares decreased by approximately 1 million, but it will have an additional positive impact on per share earnings in future periods.
FHN incurred $80.3 million of securities losses included in continuing operations in first quarter 2006, predominantly related to repositioning approximately $2.3 billion of investment securities. Additionally, there were $.3 million of incremental costs related to the execution of the restructuring. The benefit of this restructuring, which occurred near the end of the quarter, was not fully realized in first quarter but will increase the average yield on the investment portfolio by approximately 120 basis points in future periods.
FHN has determined that certain derivative transactions used in hedging strategies to manage interest rate risk did not qualify for hedge accounting under the "short cut" method, as have a number of other banks. As a result, any fluctuations in the market value of the derivatives should have been recorded through the income statement with no corresponding offset to the hedged item. While management believes these hedges would have qualified for hedge accounting under the "long haul" method, that accounting cannot be applied retroactively. FHN evaluated the impact to all quarterly and annual periods since the inception of the hedges and concluded that the impact was immaterial in each period. In first quarter 2006, FHN recorded an adjustment to recognize the cumulative impact of these transactions that resulted in a negative $15.6 million impact to noninterest income, which was included in continuing operations. FHN has subsequently redesignated these hedge relationships under SFAS No . 133 using the "long haul" method.
Other items included in continuing operations for first quarter 2006:
- A pre-tax loss of $12.7 million was recognized from the sale of   home equity lines of credit (HELOC) upon which the borrower had not   drawn funds ("no-balance"). The loss represents deferred loan   origination costs, generally recognized over the life of the loan,   which were recognized when the line of credit was sold. This   transaction reduces amortization of deferred loan origination costs   over the next three to four years. - Mortgage banking experienced foreclosure losses and other expenses   of $13.2 million compared to historical levels of approximately $2   million to $3 million related to nonprime mortgage loans. Going   forward, profitability of the nonprime origination business is   expected to return to normal levels as management has implemented   improved procedures to address more stringent investor requirements   and to ensure a more disciplined approach to managing the risk of   this held for sale portfolio of loans. - FHN underwent a change in the dynamics of its business   relationship with the U.S. Mint, through which collectible coins   are distributed, and recognized expenses of $9.3 million this   quarter, representing the devaluation of packaging inventories and   costs of closing retail locations. - Continually looking for ways to better align the cost structure,   FHN incurred expenses of $5.2 million related to consolidating   operations and office closings. - Compensation expense of $4.5 million related to early retirement,   severance and retention was recognized in the current quarter but   will reduce costs and should improve performance going forward. - FHN continues to implement enterprise-wide synergies which   resulted in $1.2 million of incremental expenditures on technology   designed to enhance efficiencies and increase productivity.
First quarter 2006 earnings also included a favorable impact of $1.3 million or $.01 per diluted share from the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. FHN adopted SFAS No. 123-R, "Share-Based Payment" in first quarter 2006 and retroactively applied the provisions of the standard. Accordingly, results for periods prior to 2006 have been adjusted to reflect expensing of share-based compensation. A cumulative effect adjustment of $1.0 million was recognized, reflecting the change in accounting for share-based compensation expense based on estimated forfeitures rather than actual forfeitures. FHN also adopted SFAS No. 156, "Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets," which allows servicing assets to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in current earnings. The adoption of this standard was applied on a prospective basis and resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of $.3 million, representing the excess of the fair value of the servicing asse t over the recorded value on January 1, 2006.

Return on average shareholders' equity and return on average assets were 37.3 percent and 2.31 percent, respectively, for first quarter 2006. Return on average shareholders' equity and return on average assets were 20.8 percent and 1.26 percent, respectively, for first quarter 2005. Total assets were $37.3 billion and shareholders' equity was $2.4 billion on March 31, 2006, compared to $35.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, on March 31, 2005.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Retail/Commercial Banking
Total revenues for Retail/Commercial Banking increased 11 percent to $331.4 million for first quarter 2006 compared to $299.5 million for first quarter 2005.
Net interest income increased 13 percent to $224.9 million in first quarter 2006 from $198.6 million in first quarter 2005 as earning assets grew 17 percent, or $3.1 billion. Loans grew 24 percent or $4.0 billion while loans held for sale decreased 53 percent or $.9 billion and deposits increased 11 percent or $1.1 billion over first quarter 2005. The Retail/Commercial Banking net interest margin was 4.25 percent in first quarter 2006 compared to 4.22 percent in fourth quarter 2005 and 4.38 percent in the first quarter of last year.
Noninterest income increased 6 percent to $106.5 million in first quarter 2006 from $100.9 million in first quarter 2005. Fees from deposit transactions and cash management increased 14 percent or $4.7 million compared to first quarter 2005 due to deposit growth and pricing initiatives. Revenue from loan sales and securitizations remained stable in first quarter 2006 due to increased volume of loans sold, while profit margins were unfavorably impacted by a shift in equity lending originations from variable rate HELOC to fixed-rate second-lien mortgages combined with competitive pricing pressures, and a gain from the sale of a portfolio of non-strategic and non-core customer credit card receivables. Also impacting this revenue stream was the $12.7 million loss from the sale of no-balance HELOC.
Provision for loan losses increased to $18.0 million in first quarter 2006 from $13.1 million last year, primarily reflecting loan growth and a gradual trend away from the recently experienced low levels of net charge-offs.
Noninterest expense was $215.6 million in first quarter 2006 compared to $179.6 million last year. The increase in noninterest expense was impacted by costs associated with the coin inventory valuation and closing of retail sites; consolidation of remittance processing operations and office closing; and early retirement costs. In addition, higher personnel costs resulted from national expansion initiatives.
Including the effect of these above items, pre-tax income for Retail/Commercial Banking decreased 8 percent to $97.8 million for first quarter 2006, compared to $106.8 million for first quarter 2005. Including the impact of discontinued merchant operations, which reflected the gain on the sale and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net income increased to $280.7 million from $75.9 million in 2005.
Mortgage Banking
Total revenues for Mortgage Banking were $120.1 million in first quarter 2006 compared to $155.8 million in first quarter 2005.
Net interest income decreased 24 percent to $25.4 million in first quarter 2006 from $33.2 million in first quarter 2005. The flattening of the yield curve resulted in compression of the spread on the warehouse, which was 1.77 percent in first quarter 2006 compared to 2.89 percent for the same period in 2005.
Noninterest income decreased to $94.7 million in first quarter 2006 compared to $122.6 million in first quarter 2005. Noninterest income consists primarily of mortgage banking-related revenue, net of costs, from the origination and sale of mortgage loans, fees from mortgage servicing and mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net hedge gains or losses. Mortgage servicing noninterest income prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 156 in first quarter 2006 was net of amortization, impairment and other expenses related to MSR and related hedges. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 156, mortgage servicing noninterest income reflects the change in fair value of the MSR asset combined with net hedging results, whether positive or negative.
Mortgage loan originations decreased to $6.9 billion in first quarter 2006 from $7.6 billion in 2005 as refinance activity dropped 22 percent. Home purchase origination volume remained stable and represented 59 percent of total originations during first quarter 2006 compared to 53 percent last year. The aggregate decline in origination volume of 10 percent was significantly better than the national market's decline of 17 percent. Loans delivered into the secondary market decreased 8 percent to $6.8 billion as originations slowed. Net revenue from mortgage loans sold decreased 28 percent to $72.3 million from $100.0 million in first quarter 2005.
The mortgage-servicing portfolio grew 11 percent to $97.3 billion on March 31, 2006, from $88.0 billion on March 31, 2005. Total fees associated with mortgage servicing increased 15 percent to $77.8 million from $67.9 million, reflecting this growth. The growth in the servicing portfolio and rising interest rates led to a 29 percent increase in the value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights from a year ago to $1.3 billion in first quarter 2006. The adoption this quarter of SFAS No. 156 changed the way net servicing revenues are being reported. Changes in the value of the MSR asset due to runoff and other portfolio adjustments reduced servicing revenue by $58.8 million. In addition, the MSR asset gained value due to rising interest rates in the amount of $96.0 million, which was offset by hedge losses on MSR derivatives of $98.3 million. During first quarter 2005, the MSR value loss due to runoff was $59.4 million, MSR change due to interest rates was an increase of $74.8 million, which was partially offset by hedge losses totaling $55.1 million. The cumulative net impact related to MSR value changes and a related change in the value of the hedge portfolio was a decline of $21.4 million. Trading asset performance and option expense further reduced servicing revenue in first quarter 2006 by $6.0 million.
Noninterest expense increased to $125.7 million in first quarter 2006 from $110.0 million in first quarter 2005 due to the unusually high level of losses associated with the nonprime origination business and $2.1 million of costs associated with branch closings, including lease abandonment and severance expenses.
Including the impact of the above items, Mortgage Banking had a pre-tax loss of $5.4 million for first quarter 2006, compared to pre-tax income of $45.8 million for first quarter 2005.
Capital Markets
Total revenues for Capital Markets were $93.3 million in first quarter 2006 compared to $91.2 million in first quarter 2005.
Revenues from fixed income sales were $50.6 million in first quarter 2006 compared to $63.0 million in first quarter 2005. However, on a sequential-quarter basis fixed income sales have increased 14 percent from fourth quarter 2005. The interest rate environment during 2005 created challenging conditions for fixed income sales as reflected in the lower revenues experienced through the third quarter of last year.
Revenues from other products were $45.9 million in first quarter 2006, an increase of $11.1 million, or 32 percent, from first quarter 2005. Revenues from other products include fee income from activities such as loan sales, investment banking, equity research, portfolio advisory and the sale of bank-owned life insurance. These other sources of revenue represented 48 percent of total product revenues in first quarter 2006 compared to 36 percent in first quarter 2005. The increase from first quarter 2005 was primarily due to increased fees from investment banking and structured finance activities. Other non-product revenues relating to a deferred compensation plan increased $3.9 million from first quarter 2005. This revenue increase was offset by a related $3.9 million increase in noninterest expense associated with this plan.
Noninterest expense increased $4.6 million compared to first quarter 2005 primarily due to the $3.9 million increase in deferred compensation plan expense discussed above. Noninterest expense increased $10.6 million from fourth quarter 2005 primarily due to increased variable compensation expense associated with the increase in product revenues, a cyclical increase in statutory fringe benefits expense, and an increase in deferred compensation plan expense which was substantially offset by a related increase in other non-product revenues.
Including the impact of the above items, Capital Markets pre-tax earnings were $6.9 million in first quarter 2006 compared to $9.4 million in first quarter 2005.
Corporate
The Corporate segment's results yielded a pre-tax loss of $108.9 million in first quarter 2006 compared to a pre-tax loss of $9.3 million in first quarter 2005. The first quarter 2006 results include $80.3 million of net securities losses, primarily related to the restructuring of the investment portfolio which resulted in securities losses of $79.3 million. Noninterest income was negatively impacted by $15.6 million due to the hedge accounting adjustment. Noninterest expense increased in 2006 due to $4.1 million dividend expense on $300 million of the bank's noncumulative perpetual preferred stock.
AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET
Total average assets increased 11 percent to $37.7 billion for first quarter 2006. Total loans increased 25 percent to $20.8 billion as commercial loans grew 26 percent and retail loans increased 24 percent. Loans held for sale decreased 10 percent to $4.8 billion. Average earning assets increased 13 percent to $33.1 billion. Interest-bearing core deposits increased 11 percent. Total core deposits increased 7 percent to $12.3 billion, which reflects targeted financial center expansion. Purchased funds increased 7 percent to $17.4 billion. Average shareholders' equity increased 13 percent in first quarter 2006.
The consolidated net interest margin was 2.99 percent for first quarter 2006 compared to 3.12 percent for first quarter 2005. This compression in the margin occurred as the net interest spread decreased to 2.44 percent in 2006 from 2.80 percent in 2005 while the impact of free funding increased from 32 basis points to 55 basis points. The decline in margin is attributable to a flatter yield curve which decreased spread on the warehouse by 112 basis points to 1.77 percent, creating a negative impact of 12 basis points on the overall corporate margin this quarter as compared to a year ago.
ASSET QUALITY
Provision for loan losses increased to $17.8 million in first quarter 2006 from $13.1 million in first quarter 2005, reflecting loan growth and a gradual trend away from the recently experienced low levels of net charge-offs. The ratio of nonperforming assets remained stable at 37 basis points in first quarter 2006 compared to 38 basis points last year. Nonperforming assets were $94.4 million on March 31, 2006, compared to $75.1 million on March 31, 2005. An increase of $6.7 million in nonperforming loans held for sale was due to deterioration in nonprime lending. The net charge-off ratio was flat compared to fourth quarter levels; however, it increased to 22 basis points in first quarter 2006 from 17 basis points in 2005 as net charge-offs grew to $11.3 million from $7.1 million during a period of strong loan growth. (See the table on A-4 for an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and details on nonperforming assets and the table on A-5 for asset quality ratios).
OUTLOOK
"Looking ahead, second quarter's earnings will benefit as the first quarter's unfavorable impact of seasonality goes away. Additionally, earnings throughout the remainder of the year should be positively impacted by the continued execution of our strategies combined with the incremental benefit of earnings enhancements. We will also benefit earnings per share impact from the transactions which utilized the proceeds from the merchant divestiture. Another recent development was the increase in Capital Markets revenues experienced this quarter. On the other hand, a more negative mortgage market or further flattening in the yield curve could create further pressure on earnings." Glass concluded, "Assuming a stable operating environment and the continuation of these operating trends, we still expect that earnings per share for the remainder of this year should grow over prior year."
