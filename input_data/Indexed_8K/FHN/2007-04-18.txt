Exhibit 99.1
First Horizon National Corporation Reports Financial Results for First Quarter 2007
* Earnings per diluted share of $.55 for first quarter 2007 * Bank's market-leading Tennessee footprint strengthened and national   specialty sales force expansion continues * Asset quality remains solid as nonperformers declined due to   charge-off of previous problem loans * Hedging costs rise over prior quarter * Consolidation initiative offsets expected seasonal decline * Downsized securities portfolio in anticipation of rebound in   mortgage production * Mortgage Alt-A and nonprime show minimal adverse impact * Additional opportunities for efficiency above and beyond those   previously announced
MEMPHIS, Tenn., April 18, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE:FHN) announced first quarter 2007 earnings of $70.5 million or $.55 per diluted share. Earnings for fourth quarter 2006 were $76.5 million or $.60 per diluted share. Results for first quarter 2007 reflected an expected seasonal decline in addition to a $15 million negative impact on mortgage hedging results. Two items partially offsetting the seasonal and hedging impacts that occurred this quarter were a $7.5 million reduction in tax expense as we received approval to consolidate our mortgage company into our bank and $10.3 million of net securities gains recognized as the investment portfolio was reduced to compensate for loan growth.
"While this quarter's earnings were lower than expected as a result of some industry-wide disruptions related to the softening housing market," said Jerry Baker, CEO of FHN, "we remain focused on our strategic vision and direction. We have made progress in building our core franchise in Tennessee and we continue to gain market share. In addition, we are exporting that banking expertise to key national markets by adding banking specialists. Our mortgage and capital markets businesses continue to be important levers in that banking expansion."
"We are working hard to return mortgage to historical levels of profitability through our strategy of building our prime, retail origination business," Baker continued. "Accordingly, we have made the decision to no longer underwrite, process and fund nonprime loans. Our nonprime business, which represents less than two percent of our mortgage loan production, has resulted in a reasonable level of repurchase activity for which we have adequate reserves to cover estimated remaining losses. However, reduced investor appetite for this product has diminished gain-on-sale margins drastically; therefore, we believe market risk no longer justifies the modest potential rewards and believe it is better to service retail customer needs through broker relationships. In contrast, our Alt-A business, which represented 20 percent of our first-lien production in first quarter 2007, has prime-type credit characteristics despite the non-standard loan structures, with an average FICO of over 715 and continues to price appropri ately. The majority of our Alt-A production is securitized and to-date, no residual or credit support structures have been retained and we have not seen any material repurchase activity from these loans."
Return on average shareholders' equity and return on average assets were 11.6 percent and .74 percent, respectively, for first quarter 2007. Return on average shareholders' equity and return on average assets were 12.1 percent and .77 percent, respectively, for fourth quarter 2006. Total assets were $38.8 billion and shareholders' equity was $2.5 billion on March 31, 2007, compared to $37.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, on December 31, 2006.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Retail/Commercial Banking
Pre-tax income for Retail/Commercial Banking was $100.4 million for first quarter 2007, compared to $108.5 million for fourth quarter 2006. Total revenues for Retail/Commercial Banking were $327.1 million for first quarter 2007 compared to $343.3 million for fourth quarter 2006.
Net interest income decreased to $224.1 million in first quarter 2007 from $228.9 million in fourth quarter 2006 due to variance in the number of days. Net interest margin remained relatively stable at 4.10 percent in first quarter 2007 compared to 4.15 percent in fourth quarter 2006. The Retail/Commercial Bank showed continued momentum in product growth as both loans and deposits grew 5 percent over first quarter 2006.
Noninterest income was $103.0 million in first quarter 2007 compared to $114.4 million in fourth quarter 2006. Fees from deposit transactions and cash management decreased $4.0 million compared to fourth quarter 2006 due primarily to lower overdraft and NSF charges per customer. Revenue from loan sales and securitizations decreased $5.4 million due to lower execution margins and a decline in the volume of loans delivered into the secondary markets.
Provision for loan losses increased to $28.5 million in first quarter 2007 from $23.3 million in fourth quarter 2006, primarily reflecting an increase in both homebuilder and one-time-close construction loans on the watch list.
Noninterest expense decreased to $198.2 million in first quarter 2007 compared to $211.5 million in fourth quarter 2006. The decrease in noninterest expense primarily reflects the net positive impact of a third-party settlement in first quarter 2007 compared to other losses recognized in fourth quarter 2006. Other expense results continue to reflect a heightened focus on containing expense growth as expenses were relatively flat in first quarter 2007 compared to fourth quarter 2006. The efficiency ratio improved to 60.6 percent from 61.6 percent in fourth quarter 2006.
Mortgage Banking
Mortgage Banking had a pre-tax loss of $11.3 million for first quarter 2007, compared to pre-tax income of $3.8 million for fourth quarter 2006. Total revenues for Mortgage Banking were $94.0 million in first quarter 2007 compared to $112.4 million in fourth quarter 2006.
Net interest income was $17.3 million in first quarter 2007 compared to $20.8 million in fourth quarter 2006. An inverted yield curve resulted in compression of the spread on the warehouse, which was 1.12 percent in first quarter 2007 compared to 1.24 percent in fourth quarter 2006.
Noninterest income was $76.7 million in first quarter 2007 compared to $91.6 million in fourth quarter 2006. Noninterest income consists primarily of mortgage banking-related revenue, net of costs, from the origination and sale of mortgage loans, fees from mortgage servicing and changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net of hedge gains or losses.
Noninterest income from mortgage origination and servicing activities declined this quarter over fourth quarter of last year. Net origination income decreased to $63.6 million in first quarter 2007 from $69.2 million in fourth quarter 2006 as loans delivered into the secondary market decreased to $6.1 billion in first quarter 2007 from $6.3 billion in fourth quarter 2006. Total mortgage servicing fees increased to $84.7 million in first quarter 2007 from $83.9 million in fourth quarter 2006, reflecting mortgage servicing portfolio growth of 6 percent on an annualized sequential quarter basis to $102.8 billion on March 31, 2007.
Servicing hedging activities and changes other than runoff in the value of capitalized servicing assets negatively impacted net revenues by $14.8 million this quarter as compared to fourth quarter 2006 due to interest rate volatility, fluctuations in MSR values and continued higher costs to hedge under an inverted yield curve. At the same time, prepayment rates slowed, lowering the change in value of MSR due to runoff to $61.7 million in first quarter 2007 from $66.9 million in fourth quarter 2006.
Noninterest expense decreased to $105.3 million in first quarter 2007 from $108.9 million in fourth quarter 2006 primarily due to the contraction in origination activities.
Capital Markets
Pre-tax earnings for Capital Markets were $3.4 million in first quarter 2007 compared to $8.6 million in fourth quarter 2006. Total revenues for Capital Markets were $83.1 million in first quarter 2007 compared to $92.7 million in fourth quarter 2006.
Revenues from fixed income sales were $46.3 million in first quarter 2007 compared to $46.2 million in fourth quarter 2006. Revenues from other products were $42.6 million in first quarter 2007 compared to $49.8 million in fourth quarter 2006. Revenues from other products include fee income from activities such as structured finance, equity research, investment banking, loan sales, portfolio advisory and the sale of bank-owned life insurance. These other sources of revenue represented 48 percent of total product revenues in first quarter 2007 compared to 52 percent in fourth quarter 2006. The decrease from fourth quarter 2006 was due to decreased fees from structured finance activities primarily as a result of a smaller pooled trust preferred transaction in first quarter 2007.
Noninterest expense decreased $4.4 million to $79.7 million in first quarter 2007 from $84.1 million in fourth quarter 2006 primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense partially offset by seasonal expense.
Corporate
The Corporate segment's results yielded a pre-tax loss of $3.4 million in first quarter 2007 compared to a pre-tax loss of $13.1 million in fourth quarter 2006. The first quarter 2007 results include $10.3 million of net securities gains as the investment portfolio was reduced to compensate for loan growth, compared to $3.0 million of net securities gains in fourth quarter 2006. Noninterest income decreased $7.0 million to $4.3 million in first quarter 2007 from $11.3 million in 2006, while noninterest expense decreased $7.3 million to $19.8 million in first quarter 2007 from $27.1 million in fourth quarter 2006. The declines in both noninterest income and noninterest expense were primarily related to deferred compensation plans.
Income Taxes
The effective corporate tax rate this quarter was 21.1 percent. Provision for income taxes was favorably impacted by $7.5 million during first quarter 2007 due to the planned consolidation of the mortgage company into the bank, a transaction designed to promote efficiencies and enhance the use of our national bank charter in our mortgage lending business.
AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET
Total average assets decreased to $38.6 billion for first quarter 2007 from $39.3 billion for fourth quarter 2006, but were up 3 percent from $37.7 billion for first quarter 2006. Total loans increased to $22.0 billion for first quarter 2007 from $21.9 billion for fourth quarter 2006 and grew 6 percent from $20.9 billion as commercial loans grew 13 percent and retail loans decreased 1 percent for first quarter 2006. Loans held for sale decreased to $3.6 billion in first quarter 2007 from $3.8 billion in fourth quarter 2006 and $4.8 billion in first quarter 2006. Average earning assets decreased to $33.8 billion in first quarter 2007 from $34.3 billion in fourth quarter 2006. Interest-bearing core deposits increased to $8.2 billion in first quarter 2007 from $8.0 billion in fourth quarter 2006 and increased 11 percent from $7.4 billion in first quarter 2006. Total core deposits increased 8 percent to $13.3 billion in first quarter 2007 from $12.3 billion in first quarter 2006, reflecting expansion strategies, which emphasize a focus on convenient hours and targeted financial center expansion. Purchased funds decreased to $14.7 billion in first quarter 2007 from $15.9 billion in fourth quarter 2006 and $17.4 billion in first quarter 2006. Average shareholders' equity was $2.5 billion in first quarter 2007, an increase of 6 percent from $2.3 billion in first quarter 2006.
The consolidated net interest margin remained stable at 2.84 percent for first quarter 2007 compared to 2.86 percent for fourth quarter 2006. The net interest spread also remained stable at 2.21 percent for first quarter 2007 and fourth quarter 2006. The decline in margin is primarily attributable to a tighter spread on the warehouse, which decreased by 12 basis points to 1.12 percent for first quarter 2007, creating a negative impact on the overall corporate margin this quarter as compared to fourth quarter 2006.
ASSET QUALITY
Provision for loan losses increased to $28.5 million in first quarter 2007 from $23.0 million in fourth quarter 2006, primarily reflecting an increase in both homebuilder and one-time-close construction loans on the watch list. The net charge-off ratio increased to 48 basis points in first quarter 2007 from 25 basis points in fourth quarter 2006 as net charge-offs grew to $26.6 million from $13.5 million in fourth quarter 2006, driven mainly by a few commercial and industrial loans in our traditional banking markets and residential real estate construction loans. A significant portion of these loans had been previously reserved and thus the increase seen in provision was less than half the increase in net charge-offs. The nonperforming assets ratio related to the loan portfolio decreased to 56 basis points in first quarter 2007 from 58 basis points in fourth quarter 2006 due to the resolution of these previously identified problem loans and as overall low levels in the retail and commercial loans portfolios outweighed the expected increase in construction lending. The allowance to loans ratio was 99 basis points in first quarter 2007 compared to 98 basis points in fourth quarter 2006. Nonperforming assets were $135.9 million on March 31, 2007, compared to $139.0 million on December 31, 2006. (See the table on A-4 for an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and details on nonperforming assets and the table on A-5 for asset quality ratios).
OUTLOOK
"Looking ahead, while the first quarter's unfavorable impact of seasonality should subside, we expect the operating environment to remain difficult," said Baker. "Our objective is to improve quarterly earnings over the remainder of 2007 significantly above our current run-rate by continuing to enhance our strategies and accelerating our efficiency initiatives. While we are going to have to do a few things differently, I believe this return to earnings growth is realistic."
"First we are fine-tuning our strategies to maximize earnings and reduce interest-rate sensitivity. We will continue to devote resources to developing our Tennessee banking market. The focus in mortgage will be on increasing prime, retail originations by growing the sales force through recruiting and targeted acquisitions and improving their productivity through dedicated sales management. Capital markets will continue to evolve as we expand other products and add international offices."
"Additionally, we are accelerating our productivity and efficiency initiatives and intend to move more aggressively to restructure our company beginning in the second quarter. As a result we will be consolidating functional areas, reducing management-to-staff ratios, closing unprofitable locations, exiting non-core businesses like nonprime lending, and refinancing portions of our capital. While we anticipate one time costs, primarily in the second and third quarters, associated with implementing these initiatives, we see the total benefits of these further efforts amounting to at least another $50 million of annualized savings in our run-rate by the end of this year, over and above the $40 million in efficiencies we currently expect to achieve."
"We are maintaining our focus on disciplined asset quality management with tightened guidelines in both retail and construction lending. We still expect asset quality to be solid for the full year of 2007 with net charge-offs averaging between 30 and 40 basis points for the year."
