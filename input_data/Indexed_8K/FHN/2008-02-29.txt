(e)      On February 25, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the company took certain actions which resulted in the grant, creation, or supplement of compensatory agreements or arrangements with executive officers of the registrant who are expected to be named in the executive compensation disclosures of the Corporation's 2008 proxy statement ("2007 Named Executive Officers"). The 2007 Named Executive Officers are: Gerald L. Baker; D. Bryan Jordan; Charles G. Burkett; Mark A. Medford; Sarah L. Meyerrose; J. Kenneth Glass; Marlin L. Mosby, III; Elbert L. Thomas, Jr.; and John P. O'Connor. During 2007 Mr. Glass retired completely, Messrs Thomas and O'Connor retired from executive officer status in anticipation of a full retirement in 2008, and Mr. Mosby moved within the company and so ceased to be an executive officer within the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules; those four persons are referred to in this Report as the "Former Executives."
The matters discussed below include final determinations concerning previously-granted performance awards, the modification of a previously-agreed bonus payment, and the establishment of 2008 salaries.
Actions related to Bonus and Equity Awards having Performance Periods ending in 2007
Summary
: The components of executive-level compensation dependent on corporate performance for 2007 or for periods ending in 2007, in nearly every case for nearly every 2007 Named Executive Officer, were determined to be substantially or entirely forfeited.
Details
: The Committee made the following determinations regarding payment, retention, forfeiture, and vesting of the following awards granted in the past to the 2007 Named Executive Officers:
Exceptions to total forfeiture:
The amounts forfeited as a result of the actions described above are summarized in the following table. Mr. Glass is not listed as he did not participate in 2007 performance awards; his earlier performance awards were forfeited upon retirement.
The bonus amounts shown reflect target levels rather than the maximum possible bonus amounts, and show the degree to which the actual bonus amount was less than the target amount. Mr. Jordan's bonus amount is shown as "NA" because his actual bonus was the minimum paid under his hiring arrangement. Mr. Medford's target amount is "NA" because his MIP bonus is paid under a pool arrangement that has no set target; his maximum bonus under the MIP is $4 million. Mr. Mosby's bonus amount is "NA" because, due to his move, his 2007 bonus was not paid under the MIP. The LTIP amounts for Messrs Jordan and Medford are "NA" because they did not receive LTIP awards in 2005.
The LTIP amounts shown in the table are the maximum amounts that would have been payable had the applicable performance criteria been met. The 2005 LTIP awards were denominated primarily in terms of a number of performance share units. Upon vesting, each unit would have represented the cash value of a share of common stock at that time. The dollar values for the 2005 LTIPs were calculated using $18.67 per share, the average of the high and low market values on February 25, 2008.
Mr. Jordan's 2007 Bonus under his Hiring Arrangement
Mr. Jordan's hiring arrangement provided that his cash annual bonus for 2007, his first year with the company, would not be less than 100% of target. His actual bonus for 2007 was the agreed target, $650,000. On February 25, 2008 the form of Mr. Jordan's 2007 bonus was modified. A portion of that bonus will be paid in the form of options to purchase 50,000 shares at an exercise price of $25 per share. That price represents a premium of $6.33 per share over the average market price of the company's stock on February 25, 2008, as noted above. The options are vested upon grant and have an expiration date seven years from grant, subject to possible early termination if Mr. Jordan's employment with the company ends. For purposes of determining how the bonus would be apportioned, the Corporation valued the options at $81,000 using a Black-Scholes methodology. The remainder of that bonus, $569,000, will be paid in cash as originally agreed.
2008 Salaries
On February 25 the Committee established the following salaries for 2008 for the 2007 Named Executive Officers other than the Former Executives: Mr. Baker, $827,000; Mr. Jordan, $672,000; Mr. Burkett, $728,000; Mr. Medford, $642,000; and Ms. Meyerrose, $485,000. In each case the new salaries reflected an increase of about 3.4% over last year. A schedule showing the 2008 salaries for the 2007 Named Executive Officers is filed with this Report as Exhibit 10.7(r) .

D. Bryan Jordan
You have been granted an option to purchase shares of First Horizon National Corporation common stock as follows:
     
This option is granted under the Governing Plan specified above, and is governed by the terms and conditions of that Plan and by policies, practices, and procedures ("Procedures") of the Compensation Committee (that administers the Plan) that are in effect from time to time during the term of this option. This option is granted in lieu of a portion of your bonus for 2007 governed by the letter agreement under which you were hired effective May 1, 2007.
     
This option is subject to possible early termination and forfeiture, even though vested, in accordance with the Plan and those Procedures and can result in a forfeiture of profit following exercise in certain circumstances as provided in the Plan (in particular, in Plan Section 6). As of the date of grant, those Procedures provide (among other things) that:
          
(a) forfeiture generally will occur immediately upon termination of employment - you must remain continuously employed by FHNC or one of its subsidiaries through the close of business on the applicable exercise date;
          
(b) however, if your termination of employment occurs because of your death, permanent disability, or
normal retirement (age 65 or later with at least 5 years of service), this option will remain outstanding and will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the expiration date set forth above, (ii) the third anniversary of your termination of employment, or (iii) the occurrence of a forfeiture event other than termination of employment;
          
(c) if your termination of employment occurs because of your early retirement (age 55 or later with at least 15 years of service), your options will continue to be exercisable as provided in clause (b) as if you had normally retired; and
          
(d) if your employment is terminated by us involuntarily, this option will remain outstanding and will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the expiration date set forth above, (ii) the 90
th
day following your termination of employment, or (iii) the occurrence of a forfeiture event other than termination of employment.
     
This option is nonqualified, so that your exercise of this option is taxable. Your withholding and other taxes will depend upon the extent to which our stock value exceeds the option price on your exercise date.
Important information concerning the Plan and this option award is contained in a prospectus. Copies of the current prospectus (including all applicable supplements) are delivered separately, and you may request a copy of the Governing Plan or prospectus at any time. If you have questions about your stock option grant or
need a copy of the Governing Plan, related prospectus, exercise forms, or current administrative procedures for equity awards, contact Ken Bottoms, Total Rewards Manager at (901) 523-5317.
