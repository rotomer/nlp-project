EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., April 17, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- First Horizon National Corporation's (NYSE:FHN) board of directors has approved payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend is payable on July 1, 2008, to shareholders of record on June 13, 2008. This is the 447th consecutive quarter that First Horizon has paid a dividend. First Horizon also announced earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, including the following:
* Net income of $7.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share in first quarter   2008 compared to a net loss of $248.6 million or $1.97 per diluted   share in fourth quarter 2007 * Increased provisioning reflecting portfolio deterioration, especially in   national construction and home equity portfolios; net charge-offs   increased to 181 basis points; allowance as a percentage of total loans   increased to 2.20% * Capital ratios remain stable, estimates based on period end balances are   8.10% for Tier I and 12.82% for Total Capital * Corporate net interest margin improves to 2.81%, reflecting lower   wholesale borrowing costs * Regional Banking franchise sees increased provision, margin compression   and benefits of efficiency initiatives; average core deposits,   excluding deposits held for divestiture, increase 2% * Capital Markets experienced strong fixed income revenues, substantially   offsetting the impact of increased provisioning and effects of credit   market disruptions * Continued focus on repositioning the Mortgage Banking business as   additional $7.5 billion of servicing sold during the quarter * Visa Inc.'s IPO resulted in $95.9 million benefit to pre-tax earnings * Continuing implementation of earnings enhancement initiatives resulted   in $21.3 million of net pre-tax charges in first quarter * Mortgage Banking recognized the benefits from improved performance and   a positive impact of approximately $40 million from the adoption of   accounting standards
The pre-tax loss, for FHN, before discontinued operations, was $1.1 million in first quarter 2008 compared to a $399.1 million pre-tax loss in fourth quarter 2007. Total revenues were $677.2 million in first quarter compared to $319.0 million in fourth quarter 2007. Noninterest expenses were $438.3 million compared to $561.5 million in fourth quarter 2007. Provision for loan losses increased $83.4 million to $240.0 million in first quarter 2008.
In first quarter 2008, average total loans increased 1 percent in comparison to fourth quarter 2007 as an increase in the mortgage warehouse was offset by a reduction in the national construction portfolios. Total average deposits decreased 9 percent for the same time period which reflects a continuing shift from wholesale CD's to more stable funding sources and the divestiture of First Horizon Bank branches. Consolidated net interest margin increased to 2.81 percent from 2.77 percent as the reduction of short-term rates lowered wholesale borrowing costs.
"We have refocused on our strong regional bank and revised our strategy to navigate successfully through a very challenging industry and economic environment. Those challenges and our active process to identify portfolio deterioration led to our increased provisioning and reserves," said Jerry Baker, CEO of First Horizon. "We continue to consider near-term strategic alternatives to reduce our mortgage business and will continue investing in our successful regional banking and capital markets businesses. We also recognize that in the current environment a strong capital position and adequate liquidity are essential."
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (First Quarter 2008 vs. Fourth Quarter 2007)
Segment Revisions Highlight Core Businesses, Provide Visibility Into National Businesses
In first quarter 2008, FHN revised its business line segments to better align with its strategic direction, representing a focus on its regional banking franchise and capital markets business. To implement this change, the prior Retail/Commercial Banking segment was split into its major components with the national portions of consumer lending and construction lending assigned to a new National Specialty Lending segment that more appropriately reflects the ongoing wind down of these businesses. Additionally, correspondent banking was shifted from Retail/Commercial Banking to the Capital Markets segment to better represent the complementary nature of these businesses. To reflect its geographic focus, the remaining portions of the Retail/Commercial Banking segment now represent the new Regional Banking segment. All prior period information has been revised to conform to the current segment structure and the discussions below are based on the new segment presentation.
Increased Provisioning Reflects Portfolio Deterioration; Charge-Offs Increase Sequentially
The net charge-off ratio was 181 basis points in first quarter 2008 compared to 93 basis points in fourth quarter 2007 as net charge-offs increased to $99.1 million from $50.8 million in fourth quarter 2007. The ratio of allowance to total loans increased to 2.20 percent from 1.55 percent in the prior quarter. Provision for loan losses increased to $240.0 million in first quarter 2008 from $156.6 million in fourth quarter 2007. The provision for first quarter 2008 reflects recognition of portfolio deterioration due to declining economic conditions, especially in national construction and home equity loans. FHN continues to apply focused portfolio management activities to identify problem assets. Provisioning for fourth quarter 2007 reflected recognition of inherent losses within residential construction portfolios, including One-Time Close and Homebuilder Finance, related to discontinued product structures and higher-risk national markets such as Florida, California, Virginia, Georgia and Nevada. The no nperforming asset ratio increased to 278 basis points in first quarter 2008 from 166 basis points in fourth quarter 2007.
Regional Banking Experiences Increased Provisioning, NIM Compression, Benefits of Efficiency Initiatives
Regional Banking recognized a pre-tax loss of $18.2 million for first quarter 2008, compared to pre-tax income of $53.3 million for fourth quarter 2007. The current quarter's loss was primarily driven by an increase in provision expense to $75.3 million from $16.0 million in prior quarter due to increased deterioration in commercial loans. Net interest margin declined to 4.39 percent in the current quarter compared to 4.74 percent in fourth quarter as the effects of Federal Reserve rate reductions were not fully passed through to deposit customers. Excluding deposits held for sale, average core deposits increased 2 percent over prior quarter. Noninterest income was affected by a seasonal decline in fees from deposit accounts. Noninterest expense decreased as the effects of efficiency initiatives more than offset seasonal increases in personnel costs. Additionally, fourth quarter 2007 included recognition of losses on owned real estate and reductions in value of low income housing investments.
Capital Markets Sees Record Fixed Income Revenues, Affected by Provisioning and Credit Disruptions
Capital Markets recognized pre-tax income of $22.8 million in first quarter 2008 compared to $30.9 million of pre-tax income in fourth quarter 2007. This primarily reflects an increase in provision for correspondent banking loans to $15.0 million from $1.2 million. Fixed income sales increased significantly as the Federal Reserve aggressively reduced rates during the quarter which resulted in a steeper yield curve. This was partially offset by a decline in other product revenues in comparison to the prior quarter primarily resulting from write downs of the warehouse for the pooled trust preferred product. Noninterest expense increased from higher production levels. Additionally, net interest income improved over fourth quarter.
National Specialty Lending Experiences Impact of Credit Losses, Effects of Winding Down Operations
National Specialty Lending had a pre-tax loss of $120.1 million for first quarter 2008 compared to a pre-tax loss of $116.1 million in fourth quarter 2007. Both quarters' losses primarily resulted from provisioning for loan losses, including the national construction and consumer lending portfolios. Net interest margin declined due to the increase in nonaccrual construction loans. Noninterest income improved sequentially as repurchase reserves decreased in comparison to fourth quarter 2007 which was partially offset by greater declines in servicing asset values for rate decreases in the current quarter. Noninterest expense declined due to the effects of the business wind down initiated during the quarter.
Mortgage Banking Positively Affected by Improved Performance and Accounting Changes
Mortgage Banking pre-tax income was $51.3 million for first quarter 2008 compared to a pre-tax loss of $254.0 million for fourth quarter 2007. Pre-tax earnings for the current quarter were positively affected by approximately $40 million related to the adoption of new accounting standards, including the prospective election of fair value accounting for mortgage warehouse loans. The prior quarter's pre-tax loss primarily reflected recognition of reductions in values of mortgage servicing rights and other retained interests, impairment of goodwill and the continued deterioration of credit markets during the quarter. Additionally, continuing efforts to reposition Mortgage Banking resulted in the sale of $7.5 billion of servicing during first quarter 2008.
Net interest income increased consistent with the increase in warehouse margin and an increase in average warehouse size. Gain on sale margins declined as effects of credit market pricing stresses continued to result in margins significantly below historical experience. The increase in servicing income compared to prior quarter was primarily due to the reduction in value of servicing assets recognized in the prior quarter to reflect lower values from observable market inputs and third party valuations. In addition, better hedging results also positively impacted current quarter performance due to wider mortgage-swap spreads and decreased options expense. Noninterest expense decreased because the impairment of goodwill and recognition of a legal settlement were recognized in the prior quarter. Noninterest expense was also negatively affected in the current quarter by the recognition of origination costs for loans recognized at elected fair value. Previously these costs had been deferred until delivery of the related loans. This effect was offset by a corresponding increase in gain on sale.
Corporate Segment Reflects Visa IPO and Earnings Enhancement Initiatives
The Corporate segment recognized $65.9 million of securities gains from Visa, Inc.'s initial public offering. Additionally, a reversal of non-interest expense totaling $30.0 million was recognized to reflect a partial reduction in the contingent liability for certain Visa litigation matters. Results for first quarter 2008 also include $21.3 million of net charges associated with implementation of restructuring, repositioning and efficiency initiatives.
