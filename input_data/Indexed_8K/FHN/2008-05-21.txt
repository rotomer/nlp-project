Recently, a First Horizon customer in California, Vineyard National Bancorp, publicly disclosed that it was a borrower under a secured line of credit with an outstanding balance of $53.3 million as of March 31, 2008.  First Horizon has had a long-standing relationship with the company and is the lead bank in this credit facility. The line of credit is a participated loan in which First Horizon's current exposure is substantially less than the total outstanding balance. Generally, First Horizon does not make specific customer information public.
 
First Horizon routinely works with its correspondent bank customers to meet their financial obligations. The financial conditions of this and other customers are reviewed on a regular basis and the loan grades are adjusted accordingly, along with any associated reserves. The portfolio of which this loan is a part was most recently reviewed and regraded in first quarter of this year.
 
The Correspondent Banking division, which is part of First Horizon's Capital Markets segment, currently has 65 different holding company relationships, representing approximately $130 million in outstanding balances and $375 million in total commitments. In that portfolio First Horizon has no current exposures in excess of $25 million inclusive of the above-mentioned borrower. In addition, the exposures are geographically diverse and the exposures in high-risk markets are limited. There are no other holding company exposures in California and only five exposures in Florida, only one of which is funded and at a minimal level.
