EXHIBIT 99.1
MEMPHIS, Tenn., July 14, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE:FHN) took several significant actions in the second quarter of 2008 to address the current market environment affecting financial institutions while also positioning the company for improved future operating performance. The issuance of $690 million in common equity provides a cushion against additional economic deterioration. The pending sale of the national mortgage banking business while also continuing to proactively address asset quality issues, including the wind down of the national lending portfolios, is reducing balance sheet risk which will permit improved capital utilization in the future. Additionally, FHN announced earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and other matters, including the following:
* A net loss of $19.1 million or $0.11 per diluted share in second   quarter 2008 compared to net income of $7.9 million or $0.06 per   diluted share in first quarter 2008 * Capital ratios improve significantly from common stock issuance and   balance sheet reductions; estimates based on period end balances   are 10.4% for Tier I and 7.0% for Tangible Common Equity to   Tangible Assets * Net charge-offs increase to $127.7 million or 235 basis points;   full-year 2008 charge-off outlook remains within previously   communicated $385 to $485 million range * Provision declines sequentially; allowance as a percentage of total   loans increases to 2.59% * Repositioning of Mortgage Banking results in agreement to sell   servicing operations and non-Tennessee origination offices,   including approximately $20 billion of servicing; $4.1 billion of   servicing sold during the quarter with approximately $12 billion of   additional servicing sales under contract * Consolidated net interest margin improves to 3.01%, reflecting   lower wholesale borrowing costs and funding benefits from the   common stock issuance * Regional Banking sees revenue increase, stable interest margin and   increased provision * Continued strong fixed income performance for Capital Markets * Implementation of earnings enhancement and business repositioning   initiatives resulted in $26.0 million of net pre-tax charges in the   current quarter
The pre-tax loss, for FHN was $47.9 million in second quarter 2008 compared to a $1.1 million pre-tax loss, before discontinued operations, in first quarter 2008. Total revenues were $637.9 million in second quarter compared to $677.2 million in the prior quarter, which included $65.9 million in securities gains. Noninterest expenses were $465.8 million compared to $438.3 million in first quarter 2008. Provision for loan losses decreased $20.0 million to $220.0 million in second quarter 2008.
In second quarter 2008, average total assets decreased 3 percent in comparison to first quarter 2008 as average total loans decreased 2 percent due to declines in both the national construction portfolios and the mortgage warehouse. Total average deposits decreased 7 percent for the same time period which reflects a continuing shift from wholesale CD's to more stable, lower cost funding sources and the divestiture of First Horizon Bank branches. Consolidated net interest margin increased to 3.01 percent from 2.81 percent as reductions of short-term rates lowered wholesale borrowing costs and the funding benefit provided by the capital raise more than offset the effects of falling rates on the Regional Bank.
"We're making significant progress with our strategy that's refocused on building our strong regional banking franchise and diversifying our strong capital markets business," said Jerry Baker, CEO of First Horizon. "This quarter we improved our capital position, announced an agreement to sell our mortgage business outside Tennessee, continued the wind-down of national lending and continued to proactively manage problem loans. These actions position the company to address the current economic environment while also laying the foundation for increasing franchise value in the future."
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (Second Quarter 2008 vs. First Quarter 2008)
Charge-Offs Increase Sequentially In Line With Expectation; Provisioning Increases Reserves
The net charge-off ratio was 235 basis points in second quarter 2008 compared to 181 basis points in the prior quarter as net charge-offs increased to $127.7 million from $99.1 million in first quarter 2008. Management's expectations for full year 2008 charge-off outlook remain within the previously communicated range of $385 to $485 million. The nonperforming asset ratio increased to 388 basis points in second quarter 2008 from 278 basis points in the prior quarter.
The ratio of allowance to total loans increased to 2.59 percent from 2.20 percent in the prior quarter. Provision for loan losses decreased to $220.0 million in the current quarter from $240.0 million in first quarter 2008. Provisioning for both second and first quarters of 2008 reflects continued aggressive efforts to address problem loans while reflecting portfolio stress from declining economic conditions, especially in national construction, home equity and C&I loans.
Regional Banking Sees Revenue Increase and Higher Provision
Regional Banking recognized a pre-tax loss of $26.7 million for second quarter 2008, compared to a pre-tax loss of $18.1 million for first quarter 2008. This change was primarily driven by an increase in provision expense to $89.4 million from $75.2 million in prior quarter due to negative grade migration in commercial loans and deterioration in the consumer loan portfolio. Net interest margin remained stable at 4.38 percent in the second quarter 2008 compared to 4.39 percent in first quarter reflecting an improved ability to pass through the effect of Federal Reserve rate reductions on deposit customers. Noninterest income was affected by a seasonal increase in fees from deposit accounts in comparison to the prior quarter. Noninterest expense remained flat as the effects of efficiency initiatives and seasonal decreases in personnel costs were offset by an increase to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.
Capital Markets Experiences Continued Strong Fixed Income Performance
Capital Markets recognized pre-tax income of $24.1 million in second quarter 2008 compared to $22.8 million of pre-tax income in first quarter 2008. Fixed income sales remained strong but declined as expected from prior quarter's record levels as the Federal Reserve slowed the pace of rate decreases. Other product revenues improved primarily due to the valuation adjustments recognized in the prior quarter on the trust preferred warehouse. Provision increased due to continued deterioration in correspondent banking loans. Noninterest expense decreased from lower production levels.
National Specialty Lending Sees Reduced Credit Losses, Wind Down of Operations Continues
National Specialty Lending had a pre-tax loss of $95.7 million for second quarter 2008 compared to a pre-tax loss of $119.7 million in the prior quarter. Both quarters' losses primarily resulted from provisioning for loan losses, including the national construction and consumer lending portfolios. Net interest income declined due to the continuing contraction of loan portfolios from the wind down of operations. Net interest margin improved over prior quarter primarily due to increased spreads on consumer loans. Noninterest income declined sequentially as repurchase reserves were increased and residual interests in prior securitizations declined in value during the current quarter. Noninterest expense increased slightly over prior quarter primarily from higher foreclosure losses.
Improved Performance in Mortgage Banking
Mortgage Banking pre-tax income was $69.2 million for second quarter 2008 compared to $50.3 million for first quarter 2008. Pre-tax earnings for first quarter were positively affected by $42.4 million related to the adoption of new accounting standards, including the prospective election of fair value accounting for mortgage warehouse loans. These standards resulted in a negative effect of $7.2 million on current quarter performance. In addition to the announced sale of servicing operations, origination offices outside of Tennessee and approximately $20 billion of servicing to MetLife; continuing efforts to reposition Mortgage Banking resulted in the sale of $4.1 billion of servicing during second quarter 2008 with approximately $12 billion of additional servicing sales under contract.
Net interest income increased consistent with the increase in warehouse spread. Gain on sale margins improved significantly primarily from government loans constituting a much higher portion of deliveries and the effects of favorable rate moves at the end of the current quarter. Servicing income declined in relation to prior quarter as the positive effects of hedging results declined as the yield curve steepened at a slower rate in second quarter in comparison to first quarter. Additionally, repurchase reserves were increased during the current quarter to reflect increased repurchase experience. Runoff remained stable in comparison to first quarter. Noninterest expense was relatively flat in comparison to prior quarter as the effects of lower personnel costs were offset by increased foreclosure losses.
Corporate Segment Reflects Earnings Enhancement Initiatives and Debt Retirements
Results for second quarter 2008 include $26.0 million of net charges associated with implementation of restructuring, repositioning and efficiency initiatives as well as $12.6 million of gains from the repurchase of debt. Prior quarter results included $21.3 million of net charges associated with efficiency initiatives, $65.9 million of securities gains from Visa, Inc.'s initial public offering, and a $30.0 million reversal of non-interest expense to reflect a partial reduction in the contingent liability for certain Visa litigation matters.
