Other Information
This financial supplement contains forward-looking statements involving significant risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking information. Those factors include general economic and financial market conditions, including expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements including the slope of the yield curve, competition, customer and investor responses to these conditions, ability to execute business plans, geopolitical developments, recent and future legislative and regulatory developments, natural disasters, and items mentioned in this financial supplement and in First Horizon National Corporation's (FHN) most recent press release, as well as critical accounting estimates and other factors described in FHN's recent filings with the SEC. FHN disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein or therein to reflect future events or developments.
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
Certain capital-related non-GAAP ratios are included in this financial supplement. FHN's management believes such ratios are relevant to understanding the capital position and results of the Company. The non-GAAP ratios presented in this Financial Supplement are tangible common equity to tangible common assets, tangible book value per common share, tier 1 common to risk weighted assets, and adjusted tangible common equity to risk weighted assets. These ratios are reported to FHN's management and Board of Directors through various internal reports. Additionally, disclosure of these ratios provides a meaningful base for comparability to other financial institutions as these ratios have become an important measure of the capital strength of banks as demonstrated by the inclusion in the stress tests administered by the United States Treasury Department under the Capital Assistance Program. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined by GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by FHN. Tier 1 capital is a regulatory term and is generally defined as the sum of core capital (including common equity and instruments that can not be redeemed at the option of the holder) adjusted for certain items under risk based capital regulations. Also a regulatory term, risk weighted assets includes total assets adjusted for credit risk and is used to determine capital ratios. Refer to the tabular reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures and presentation of the most comparable GAAP items on page 34 of this financial supplement.

Risk Grading
Reserves are established using historical loss factors by grade level. Relationship managers risk rate each loan using grades that reflect both the probability of default and estimated loss in the event of default. Loans with emerging weaknesses receive increased oversight through our Watch List process.
Watch List Process
For new Watch List loans, senior credit management reviews risk grade appropriateness and action plans. After initial identification, relationship managers prepare regular updates for review and discussion by more senior business line and credit officers. This oversight is intended to bring consistent grading and allow timely identification of loans that need to be further downgraded or placed on non-accrual status.
Classified & Non-Accruals
When a loan becomes classified, the asset generally transfers to the specialists in our Loan Rehab and Recovery group where the accounts receive more active management and detailed monitoring; at this time, new appraisals are typically ordered for real estate collateral dependent credits.
Loans are placed on non-accrual status if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, or if loans become 90 days or more past due.
Impairment Assessment
Generally, classified non-accrual loans over $1 million are deemed to be impaired in accordance with GAAP and are assessed for impairment measurement. For impaired assets viewed as collateral dependent, fair value estimates are obtained from a recently received and reviewed appraisal. Appraised values are adjusted down for costs associated with asset disposal and for our estimate of any further deterioration in values since the most recent appraisal. Upon the determination of impairment, we charge off the full difference between book value and our best estimate of the asset's net realizable value.
 
One-Time Close (OTC) Loans
For OTC real estate construction loans, reserve levels are established based on portfolio modeling and regular portfolio reviews conducted with business line managers and credit officers. In addition, OTC loans that reach 90 days past due are placed on non-accrual. A new appraisal is ordered for loans that reach 90 days past due or are classified as substandard during the monthly portfolio review. Loans are initially written down to current appraised value. Loans are then assessed for charge down again when they reach 180 days past due, and again when they are taken into OREO.
 
Home Equity Loans & Lines
For home equity loans and lines, reserve levels are established through the use of segmented roll rate models. Loans are classified substandard at 90 days delinquent. Our collateral position is assessed prior to the asset becoming 180 days delinquent. If the value does not support foreclosure, balances are charged-off and other avenues of recovery are pursued. If the value supports foreclosure, the loan is charged down to net realizable value and is placed on non-accrual status. When collateral is taken to OREO, the asset is assessed for further write down to appraised value.
