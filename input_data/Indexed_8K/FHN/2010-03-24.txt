On March 18, 2010, two subsidiaries of First Horizon National Corporation ("FHN"), FTN Financial Securities Corp. ("FTNFS") and First Tennessee Bank National Association, along with an executive officer, Frank J. Gusmus, Jr., received written "Wells" notices from the Staff of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") stating that the Staff intends to recommend that the SEC bring enforcement actions for allegedly aiding and abetting a former FTNFS customer, Sentinel Management Group, Inc. ("Sentinel"), in violations of the federal securities laws. The subject of the Wells notices is a 2006 year-end securities repurchase transaction entered into by FTNFS with Sentinel, as discussed in Note 18 of FHN's Annual Report to shareholders for the year 2009. A Wells notice by the SEC Staff is neither a formal allegation of wrongdoing nor a determination by the SEC that there has been wrongdoing. A Wells notice generally provides the recipient with an opportunity to provide his, her, or its perspective to address the Staff's concerns prior to enforcement action being taken by the SEC. FHN believes that its subsidiaries and Mr. Gusmus complied with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the transaction. FHN and Mr. Gusmus intend to work within the Wells process to try to avoid the commencement of enforcement actions. If such actions are brought nonetheless, FHN believes they have meritorious defenses and they intend to advance those defenses vigorously.
