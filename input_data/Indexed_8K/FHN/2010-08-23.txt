On August 20, 2010, Simon F. Cooper, a non-employee director of First Horizon National Corporation, notified the Company's Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee Chairman and the Company's Chief Executive Officer that he would be tendering his resignation as a director of the Company because he was moving to Hong Kong at year-end as a result of his appointment as President and Managing Director of Marriott International, Asia Pacific. Mr. Cooper's decision was not due to any disagreement with the Company on any matter. Mr. Cooper's tender of resignation is not yet effective.
