The authority of the Board of Directors shall include, but not be limited to, the determination or fixing of the following with respect to shares of such class or any series thereof: (1) the number of shares and designation; (2) the dividend rate and whether dividends are to be cumulative; (3) whether shares are to be redeemable and, if so, the terms and amount of any sinking fund for the purchase or redemption of such shares; (4) whether shares shall be convertible and, if so, the terms and provisions applying; (5) what voting rights are to apply, if any; and (6) what restrictions are to apply, if any, on the issue or re-issue of any additional preferred stock.
 
11.       ADDITIONAL POWERS.
 
(a)      The Corporation shall have the right to purchase, take, receive or otherwise acquire, hold, own, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of its own shares; but purchases of its own shares, whether direct or indirect, shall be made only to the extent of unreserved and unrestricted earned or capital surplus available therefor.

(4)      To use or apply any funds of the corporation lawfully available therefor for the purchase or acquisition of shares of the capital stock or bonds or other securities of the corporation, in the market or otherwise, at such price as may be fixed by the Board, and to such extent and in such manner and for such purposes and upon such terms as the Board may deem expedient and as may be permitted by law, and to sell, exchange, transfer, reissue or cancel such shares of the capital stock of the corporation upon such terms and for such consideration as it may deem proper.
 
(5)      To determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions and regulations the accounts and books of the corporation, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection of the shareholders, and no shareholder shall have any right to inspect any account, record, book or document of the corporation, except as conferred by the laws of the State of Tennessee or as authorized by the Board.
 
(6)      To remove any director for cause as defined by the laws of the State of Tennessee by a vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors.

12.       NUMBER, ELECTION AND TERMS OF DIRECTORS.
 
(a)      The number of directors of the Corporation which shall constitute the entire Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to time in the Bylaws of the Corporation. Any such determination shall continue in effect unless and until changed, but no such changes shall affect the term of any director then in office. At the annual meeting of shareholders that is held in calendar year 2008, the successors of the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders that is held in calendar year 2011; provided, however, that any director whose term expires at the 2008 annual meeting solely due to the operation of Section 48-18-105(d) of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act shall be elected for the remainder of the term of the class of directors to which he or she has been assigned. Commencing at the annual meeting of shareholders that is held in calendar year 2009, directors shall be elected annually for terms of one year, except that any director in office at the 2009 annual meeting whose term expires at the annual meeting of shareholders held in calendar year 2010 or 2011 shall continue to hold office until the end of the term for which such director was elected. In all cases, directors shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.
 
(b)      Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or any other cause (except removal from office) shall be filled only by the Board of Directors, provided that a quorum is then in office and present, or only by a majority of the directors then in office, if less than a quorum is then in office, or by the sole remaining director. Any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from removal from office may be filled by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock or, if the shareholders do not so fill such a vacancy, by a majority of the directors then in office. Directors of the Corporation may be removed by the shareholders only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock.
 
(c)      The Bylaws or any Bylaw of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed only by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the directors then in office at any regular or special meeting of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock at any annual meeting or any special meeting called for that purpose. Any provision of the Charter which is inconsistent with any provision of the Bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock at any annual meeting or any special meeting called for that purpose.
 
(d)      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Charter or the Bylaws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage or separate class vote may be specified by law, this Charter, the Bylaws of the Corporation or otherwise), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of all
 
Page 7 of 8
outstanding voting stock shall be required to adopt any provisions inconsistent with, or to amend or repeal, this Article 12.
 
(e)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or by series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Charter applicable thereto.
 
13.       VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS.
 
Except as provided in Article 12, each director shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting of shareholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if, as of (a) the expiration of the time fixed under Section 3.6 of the Corporations Bylaws (or any successor provision) for advance notice of nomination of a director by a shareholder or, (b) in the absence of any such provision, a date that is fourteen (14) days in advance of the date the Corporation files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of nominees exceeds the number of positions on the Board of Directors to be filled by election at the meeting, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at any such meeting. For purposes of this section, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast for a director exceeds the number of votes cast against that director.
 
14.       DIRECTOR LIABILITY.
 
No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its shareholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or (iii) under Section 48-18-304, or any successor provision thereto, of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act.
