Other Information
This financial supplement contains forward-looking statements involving significant risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking information. Those factors include general economic and financial market conditions, including expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements including the slope of the yield curve, competition, customer and investor responses to these conditions, ability to execute business plans, geopolitical developments, recent and future legislative and regulatory developments, natural disasters, and items mentioned in this financial supplement and in First Horizon National Corporation's (FHN) most recent press release, as well as critical accounting estimates and other factors described in FHN's recent filings with the SEC. FHN disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein or therein to reflect future events or developments.
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
Certain ratios are included in this financial supplement that are non-GAAP, meaning they are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S. FHN's management believes such ratios are relevant to understanding the capital position and results of the Company. The non-GAAP ratios presented in this Financial Supplement are tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, tier 1 common to risk weighted assets, adjusted tangible common equity to risk weighted assets, and net interest margin adjusted for FTE. These ratios are reported to FHN's management and Board of Directors through various internal reports. Additionally, disclosure of non-GAAP capital ratios provides a meaningful base for comparability to other financial institutions as the capital ratios have become an important measure of the capital strength of banks as demonstrated by the inclusion in the stress tests administered by the United States Treasury Department under the Capital Assistance Program. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined by GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by FHN. Tier 1 capital is a regulatory term and is generally defined as the sum of core capital (including common equity and instruments that can not be redeemed at the option of the holder) adjusted for certain items under risk based capital regulations. Also a regulatory term, risk weighted assets includes total assets adjusted for credit risk and is used to determine capital ratios. Refer to the tabular reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures and presentation of the most comparable GAAP items on page 28 of this financial supplement.

Shareholders' equity excluding intangible assets and unrealized gains/losses on available for sale securities and cash flow hedges divided by risk weighted assets.
Adjusted Tangible Equity/RWA:
Management treats regional banking, capital markets, and corporate as FHN's core businesses. Non-strategic has significant legacy assets and operations that are being wound down.
Core Business Segments:
Commercial loans over $1 million that are not expected to pay all contractually due principal and interest and consumer loans that have experienced a troubled debt restructuring and are individually evaluated for impairment. The estimated loss on these loans is determined using a discounted cash flow ("DCF") methodology or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, if the loan is considered collateral dependent. In accordance with accounting requirements, DCF loans are discounted using the applicable note rate, and typically reserves are maintained for DCF loans. Collateral dependent loans are generally charged off to the estimate of collateral value less cost to sell leaving no associated reserve.
Individually Impaired Loans:
A method of accounting for certain assets by recording them at the lower of their historical cost or their current market value.
Lower of Cost or Market (LOCOM):
The 2010 requirement by Federal Reserve Board Regulation E that consumer customers of banks must elect, or opt-in, to continue to be eligible for fee-based overdraft protection services regarding debit card and ATM transactions. Consumer customers who do not opt-in cannot be charged fees for such services and will not receive such services.
Reg E Opt-In:
Assets of a consolidated variable interest entity that can be used only to settle obligations of the consolidated variable interest entity and liabilities of a consolidated variable interest entity for which creditors (or beneficial interest holders) do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.
Restricted Balances:
A restructuring of debt whereby a creditor for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Such concession is granted in an attempt to protect as much of the creditor's investment as possible by increasing the probability of repayment.
