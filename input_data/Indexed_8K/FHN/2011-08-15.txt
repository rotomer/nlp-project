             On August 11, 2011, First Horizon National Corporation ("First Horizon") closed the sale of a subsidiary, First Horizon Msaver, Inc. ("Msaver"). Msaver's primary business is the provision of administrative services for health savings accounts. Approximately $170 million of deposits associated with MSaver's business currently are held by First Horizon's banking subsidiary and are expected to be transferred to another depositary in due course as a result of the transaction.
 
In the third quarter of 2011, First Horizon expects to recognize a pre-tax gain from the Msaver transaction of approximately $9 million. In prior reports relating to earlier periods, the Msaver business assets, obligations, and results were reported in First Horizon's Regional Banking segment. In future reports, Msaver will be reported in the Non-Strategic segment and will be presented as discontinued operations; all prior periods shown in future reports will be conformed to the new presentation.
