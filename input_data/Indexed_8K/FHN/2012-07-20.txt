TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
Other Information
This financial supplement contains forward-looking statements involving significant risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking information. Those factors include general economic and financial market conditions, including expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements including the slope of the yield curve, competition, customer and investor responses to these conditions, ability to execute business plans, geopolitical developments, recent and future legislative and regulatory developments, natural disasters, and items mentioned in this financial supplement and in First Horizon National Corporation's ("FHN") most recent press release, as well as critical accounting estimates and other factors described in FHN's recent filings with the SEC. FHN disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein or therein to reflect future events or developments.
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
Certain ratios are included in this financial supplement that are non-GAAP, meaning they are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the U.S. FHN's management believes such ratios are relevant to understanding the capital position and results of the Company. The non-GAAP ratios presented in this financial supplement are tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, tier 1 common to risk weighted assets, adjusted tangible common equity to risk weighted assets, and net interest margin adjusted for fully taxable equivalent ("FTE"). These ratios are reported to FHN's management and Board of Directors through various internal reports. Additionally, disclosure of non-GAAP capital ratios provides a meaningful base for comparability to other financial institutions as demonstrated by their use by the various banking regulators in reviewing the capital adequacy of financial institutions. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined by GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by FHN. Tier 1 capital is a regulatory term and is generally defined as the sum of core capital (including common equity and instruments that can not be redeemed at the option of the holder) adjusted for certain items under risk based capital regulations. Also a regulatory term, risk weighted assets includes total assets adjusted for credit risk and is used to determine capital ratios. Refer to the tabular reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures and presentation of the most comparable GAAP items on page 27 of this financial supplement.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
 
Summary of Second Quarter 2012 Significant Items
(Millions)
 
(Second Quarter 2012 vs. First Quarter 2012)
 
Consolidated
 Net loss available to common shareholders was $124.8 million, or $.50 loss per diluted share, compared to net income of $30.5 million, or $.12 per diluted share in first quarter
 Net interest income ("NII") increased slightly in second quarter to $172.7 million; The net interest margin ("NIM") increased to 3.16 percent from 3.12 percent
 The increase in NII is primarily attributable to an increase in commercial loan fees coupled with lower funding costs
 The increase in NIM is largely due to a decline in excess cash held at the Fed and an increase in commercial loan fees which were partially offset by a lower yielding securities portfolio
 Noninterest income (including security gains) was $158.9 million in second quarter, a decrease of $43.5 million from first quarter
 Decrease primarily driven by lower fixed income revenue within capital markets in second quarter and a decline in mortgage banking income within the non-strategic segment
 Provision expense was $15.0 million in second quarter compared to $8.0 million in first quarter
 Noninterest expense was $527.2 million in second quarter compared to $322.0 million in first quarter
 Increase primarily driven by an increase to the repurchase and foreclosure provision
 These increases were partially offset by a decline in personnel costs within capital markets commensurate with lower fixed income revenue
 Period-end loans were $16.2 billion for the second quarter compared to $16.0 billion in first quarter; average loan balances were $16.0 billion for both quarters
 The increase in the period-end loan portfolio is primarily driven by the increase in loans to mortgage companies and real estate installment loans, partially offset by continued run-off within the non-strategic portfolios
 Average core deposits decreased slightly to $15.6 billion in second quarter, period-end decreased 5% to $15.5 billion
Regional Banking
 Net interest income increased $1.1 million in second quarter
 Increase in NII primarily attributable to higher commercial loan fees in second quarter
 Provision was $4.8 million in second quarter compared to a provision credit of $7.4 million in prior quarter
 Commercial reserve levels reflect continued stabilization of the commercial portfolio; slight increase in the level of consumer reserves
 Period-end loans increased $380.8 million to $12.0 billion primarily due to an increase in loans to mortgage companies and real estate installment loans
 Noninterest income increased to $64.8 million in second quarter from $59.9 million in first quarter
 Deposit fee income increased primarily due to seasonality in non-sufficient funds ("NSF") fee structure
 Second quarter includes $1.8 million gain related to the sale of a branch
 Noninterest expense increased to $142.4 million in second quarter from $139.4 million in prior quarter
Capital Markets
 Fixed income revenues declined to $68.2 million in second quarter from $98.6 million in first quarter
 Fixed income average daily revenue ("ADR") was $1.1 million in second quarter compared to $1.6 million in first quarter
 Noninterest expense decreased to $60.9 million in second quarter from $80.3 million in prior quarter
 Variable compensation costs decreased consistent with the decrease in fixed income ADR
Corporate
 NII was negative $4.1 million in second quarter compared to negative $4.7 million in first quarter
 Noninterest income (including securities gains) was $3.8 million in second quarter compared to $9.3 million in prior quarter
 Decline primarily resulting from lower deferred compensation income due to market conditions and is mirrored by a reduction in deferred compensation expense
 Noninterest expense decreased to $19.4 million in second quarter from $22.5 million in prior quarter
 The decline in deferred compensation expense was partially offset by an increase in restructuring costs, primarily severance
 
 
 
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (continued)
 
(Second Quarter 2012 vs. First Quarter 2012)
 
Non-Strategic
 NII decreased $.9 million to $24.0 million in second quarter due to the continued contraction of loan portfolios
 Provision expense decreased to $10.2 million in second quarter from $15.4 million in prior quarter due to continued stabilization and runoff of the consumer portfolio
 Noninterest income (including securities gains) decreased to $15.3 million in second quarter from $26.5 million in prior quarter primarily due to a decline in mortgage banking income
 Positive net hedging results decreased to $1.8 million in second quarter from $9.1 million in prior quarter
 Mortgage banking was also negatively affected by a decline in servicing fees and adjustment made as a result of contingencies related to prior servicing sales
 Decline in mortgage banking income was partially offset by a $5.1 million gain on sale of a venture capital investment
 Noninterest expense increased to $304.5 million in second quarter from $79.8 million in prior quarter
 Provisioning for repurchase and foreclosure losses was $250.0 million in second quarter compared to $49.3 million in first quarter
 The repurchase liability for first lien mortgage loans increased to $360.5 million in second quarter from $161.2 million in first quarter
 Second quarter provision reflects a change in estimate of FHN's repurchase obligations for alleged breaches of reps and warranties related to mortgage loans sold to Fannie and Freddie
 Change in estimate reflects significant new information from Fannie including loans currently selected for review; information supporting anticipated future selections (primarily from seriously delinquent and liquidated loan pools); and asset quality statistics for loans sold to Fannie (primarily loans no longer serviced by FHN)
 Data utilized to extrapolate probable incurred losses related to loans sold to Freddie; Ginnie loans were not included in the extrapolation
 Unless GSE repurchase practices or outcomes change significantly, FHN expects that the mortgage repurchase reserve established as of the end of the second quarter will be sufficient for losses resulting from current pending and projected repurchase requests from Fannie and Freddie
 Active pipeline increased to $430.6 million from $380.3 million in prior quarter
 Repurchase/make whole requests were $363.4 million as of the end of second quarter and primarily relate to requests from Fannie/Freddie
 Cumulative average rescission rates ranging between 45 percent and 55 percent with cumulative average loss severities ranging between 50 percent and 60 percent
 Second quarter includes a $22.0 million loss accrual related to pending legal matters
Asset Quality
 Allowance as a percentage of loans ratio decreased to 198 basis points from 217 basis points in prior quarter
 Second quarter allowance reflects continued stabilization of loan portfolios and improving asset quality metrics
 Provision expense increased to $15.0 million during second quarter from $8.0 million in prior quarter
 Annualized net charge-offs decreased to 101 basis points of average loans from 116 basis points in prior quarter
 Net charge-offs were $40.0 million in second quarter compared to $46.3 million in prior quarter
 Commercial net charge-offs were flat at $11.0 million in second quarter
 Consumer net charge-offs were $29.0 million in second quarter, a $6.6 million decline from prior quarter
 Nonperforming assets ("NPAs") decreased 8.69 percent from prior quarter; NPA ratio declined to 232 basis points from 256 basis points
 Foreclosed assets declined as disposition activity more than offset new inflow
 Troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") were $478.1 million at the end of second quarter compared with $429.6 million prior quarter
 Commercial Portfolio:
 Reserves decreased $13.4 million from prior quarter primarily driven by the C&I portfolio within the regional bank
 Reserve levels reflect continued aggregate improvement of the portfolio as upgrades outpaced downgrades
 Some upgrades within the TRUPs and bank stock portfolio; the lowest tier borrowers remain stressed and are closely monitored
 Consumer Portfolio:
 Reserves decreased $11.5 million in second quarter from $180.4 million in first quarter driven by consumer real estate portfolio within the non-strategic segment
 Balances of consumer real estate loans increased within the regional banking segment, partially offsetting runoff from the non-strategic portfolios
 Performance of the home equity portfolio improved in second quarter; 30+ delinquency rates decreased to 129 basis points from 142 basis points in prior quarter
 Reserves for the Permanent Mortgage portfolio decreased $3.5 million; Allowance to loans increased to 3.77 percent from 3.62 percent
 The decrease in reserves was driven by lower delinquencies as 30+ delinquency declined to 149 basis points from 216 basis points in the prior quarter
 The decline was mitigated by an increase in TDR reserves in second quarter
Taxes
 Second quarter includes approximately $7 million of positive effect from permanent tax credits
