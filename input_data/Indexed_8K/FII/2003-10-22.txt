Federated Investors, Inc. Reports Record EPS of $0.46 for the Third Quarter of 2003
 
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, PA, October 22, 2003)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment management companies, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.46 for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, an increase of seven percent from $0.43 per share for Q3 2002 and an increase of five percent from $0.44 per share for Q2 2003. Federated reported year-to-date 2003 EPS of $1.32, which equals the amount for the first nine months of 2002. Net income was $50.9 million and $148.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, compared to $49.9 million and $154.9 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2002.
 
Federated's assets under management were $194.1 billion at September 30, 2003, up $13.2 billion or seven percent from $180.9 billion at September 30, 2002 and down $8.3 billion from the $202.4 billion reported at June 30, 2003. Average managed assets for Q3 2003 were $198.7 billion, $8.7 billion higher than the $190.0 billion reported for Q3 2002 and slightly lower than the $199.4 billion in average managed assets reported for Q2 2003.
 
"Improved equity market conditions combined with solid net inflows into our equity products were the drivers of our strong performance during the third quarter," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO. "Federated's diverse revenue mix continues to enable the company to succeed across varying market conditions."
 
The company also announced today that its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.085 per share. The dividend is payable on November 14, 2003, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2003. Federated continued its share buyback program by purchasing 252,100 shares of Federated Investors, Inc. class B common stock for $7.1 million in the open market.
 
Through its mutual funds and separate accounts, Federated managed $51.8 billion in fixed-income and equity assets as of September 30, 2003, an increase of 22 percent from $42.4 billion at the end of Q3 2002. As a result of positive market conditions and flows, equity assets increased to $22.4 billion at the

end of Q3 2003, compared to $17.1 billion at the end of Q3 2002 and $20.8 billion at the end of Q2 2003. The Federated Kaufmann Fund was the top selling equity fund during the quarter, followed by Federated Capital Appreciation Fund, a core blend fund; Federated Market Opportunity Fund, a mid-cap value fund; and Federated International Equity Fund, an international large-cap growth fund.
 
Fixed-income assets were $29.4 billion at September 30, 2003, up $4.1 billion from the end of Q3 2002 and down slightly from the end of Q2 2003.
 
Money market assets in both funds and separate accounts totaled $142.3 billion at September 30, 2003, $3.7 billion or three percent over the $138.6 billion at September 30, 2002 and down $9.1 billion from June 30, 2003. Average money market assets were $147.6 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, compared to $147.2 billion for Q3 2002 and $150.3 billion for Q2 2003. Money market fund assets increased to $128.6 billion at the end of Q3 2003 from $126.3 billion at the end of Q3 2002 and decreased from the $135.9 billion at the end of the prior quarter.
 
For the third quarter of 2003, total revenue increased six percent to $183.0 million from Q3 2002 and grew by three percent from the prior quarter. Total revenue for the first nine months of 2003 declined slightly to $531.0 million from $537.2 million for the first nine months of 2002. Federated's revenue growth was due largely to the increase in both equity and fixed income assets since Q3 2002, while the increase in revenue since Q2 2003 was due primarily to the increase in equity assets. For Q3 2003, Federated derived 44 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 30 percent from equity assets, 20 percent from fixed-income assets and 6 percent from other products.
 
Operating expenses increased 12 percent for Q3 2003 to $99.8 million from $89.5 million for Q3 2002 and increased two percent from the prior quarter due largely to higher compensation expenses. For the first nine months of the year, operating expenses increased two percent to $289.0 million compared to $283.8 million for the same period last year.

Federated Provides Update on Inquiries into Mutual Fund Shareholder Trading Practices
 
(PITTSBURGH, PA, October 22, 2003)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII) today released the following statement concerning inquiries into mutual fund shareholder trading practices:
 
Like many other mutual fund companies, Federated Investors has received detailed requests for information on shareholder trading activities from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York State Attorney General and the National Association of Securities Dealers. The company has retained the law firm of Reed Smith LLP to conduct an internal investigation, which is ongoing. Cooperating with these regulatory authorities and the completion of the internal investigation are top priorities for the company.
 
The internal investigation is examining, among other things, circumstances in which it appears that a few investors in Federated funds were granted exceptions to the company's internal procedures for limiting frequent transactions, and that some of these investors made additional investments in other Federated funds. The investigation has also identified instances in which it appears that orders for Federated variable net asset value funds were placed and accepted after the funds' closing time at 4:00 p.m.
 
Federated's investigation into these matters continues and the company is taking steps to ensure that its fund shareholder trading policies are adhered to.
 
Reed Smith is reporting its findings to a special committee appointed by Federated's board. The special committee, consisting of three independent directors, the company's chief executive officer and its chief legal officer, is reporting and making recommendations to the full board. Additionally, attorneys from the law firm of Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky LLP, independent counsel to the Federated mutual funds, are participating in the investigation, and are reporting to the independent directors of the mutual funds, on their progress.
 
Federated is committed to taking remedial actions when and as appropriate, including compensating the funds for any detrimental impact these transactions may have had on them. Based upon the progress of

the investigation to date, Federated does not have sufficient information regarding these transactions to make a reasonable estimate of the amount, if any, by which the funds have been impacted. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2003, no reserve had been recorded for possible losses that may result.
