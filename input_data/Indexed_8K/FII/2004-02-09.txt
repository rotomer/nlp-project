Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Federated Investors, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2003 Results
 
 
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, PA, February 9, 2004)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment management companies, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.38 and net income of $42.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of 10 and 13 percent, respectively from the $0.42 and $48.9 million reported in Q4 2002. Q4 2003 EPS includes a charge of $0.12 per share related to the establishment of a $7.6 million restoration fund and $12.4 million for other expenses related to the internal review regarding past mutual fund trading practices. For full year 2003, including the impact of the aforementioned internal review and restoration charge, Federated reported EPS of $1.71 and net income of $191.5 million, a decrease of two and six percent, respectively from 2002.
 
For comparison of Q4 2003 to Q4 2002 EPS, excluding the aforementioned charge of $0.12, Q4 2003 EPS would have been $0.50 ($0.38 + $0.12), which is 19 percent higher than the Q4 2002 EPS of $0.42. Management believes the exclusion of this charge is useful to evaluate the performance of the company apart from the impact of the internal review.
 
"With our internal review substantially complete, Federated continues to enhance existing procedures and controls," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO. "Federated appreciates the patience of our clients while we conducted our internal review. We move forward with the goal of exceeding client expectations as we focus on our core competenciesmanaging competitive investment products and continuing to have the long-term commitment to our clients when distributing those products."
 
Federated's total managed assets were $197.9 billion at December 31, 2003, up $2.5 billion or one percent from $195.4 billion at the end of 2002 and up two percent from the end of Q3 2003. Average managed assets for Q4 2003 were $199.1 billion, $6.5 billion higher than the $192.6 billion reported for Q4 2002 and slightly higher than the $198.7 billion in average assets reported for Q3 2003.

The company also announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.085 per share. The dividend is payable on February 27, 2004, to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2004. During 2003, Federated purchased 4,415,000 shares of class B common stock for $113.5 million in the open market. Due to the internal review, Federated did not repurchase shares during Q4 2003, but subject to normal blackout provisions for earnings and material events, plans to resume its share repurchase program.
 
Through its mutual funds and separate accounts, Federated managed a record $55.1 billion in equity and fixed-income assets as of December 31, 2003, an increase of 24 percent from $44.6 billion at the end of 2002. As a result of positive market conditions and flows, equity assets increased to a record $25.6 billion as of December 31, 2003, compared to $18.1 billion at the end of 2002 and $22.4 billion at the end of Q3 2003.
 
Federated's top selling equity funds earned overall five-star ratings from Moringstar. The Federated Kaufmann Fund was our top selling equity fund for Q4 2003; followed by Federated Capital Appreciation Fund, a core blend fund; and Federated Market Opportunity Fund, a strategic value fund. As of December 31, 2003, Federated Kaufmann Fund A, B, C and K shares were rated five stars overall out of 613 mid-cap growth funds; Federated Market Opportunity Fund A, B and C shares were rated five stars overall out of 632 moderate allocation funds; and Federated Capital Appreciation Fund A, B, C and K shares were rated five stars overall out of 1,103 large blend funds. Morningstar ratings are based on risk-adjusted total return. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of the fund's three-, five- and ten-year average annual returns, as applicable.
 
"Federated's enhanced investment research team and the information advantage created through our proprietary research are generating results," Donahue said. "We ended the year with several additional equity funds earning top-rated rankings in a variety of categories. We expect to have continued success distributing these products across our multi-channel distribution platform."
 
Fixed-income assets were $29.5 billion at December 31, 2003, up $3.0 billion from the end of Q4 2002 and up slightly from the end of Q3 2003.
 
Money market assets in both funds and separate accounts totaled $142.8 billion at December 31, 2003, $7.9 billion or five percent less than the $150.7 billion at December 31, 2002 and up slightly from $142.3 billion at September 30, 2003. Average money market assets were $145.3 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, compared to $148.9 billion for the same period last year and $147.6 billion for Q3 2003. Average money market fund assets decreased to $132.0 billion for Q4 2003 from $135.9 billion for Q4 2002 and decreased from $133.2 billion for the prior quarter.

Financial Highlights
 
The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income reflect changes in the presentation of certain contractual obligations with respect to expenses of third parties. In Q4 2003, Federated reclassified certain distribution-related and other items on the Consolidated Statements of Income. These reclassifications are intended to better reflect Federated's contractual obligations related to third-party distribution of its products and other services. These expenses, which were previously netted against their respective revenues, are now presented as operating expenses. The company believes that the new presentation provides greater clarity for these items. This change had no impact on current or prior years' net income.
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2003, total revenue increased 10 percent to $216.8 million from $197.3 million for Q4 2002 and grew by three percent from the prior quarter. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased two percent to $823.2 million compared to $808.8 million for the prior year.
 
Operating expenses increased 23 percent for Q4 2003 to $146.2 million from $119.1 million for Q4 2002 and increased 15 percent from $126.8 million the prior quarter due largely to the aformentioned charge of $20.0 million included in Q4 2003 operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2003, operating expenses increased seven percent to $510.8 million compared to $477.1 million last year.
 
For Q4 2003, Federated derived 44 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 31 percent from equity assets, 19 percent from fixed-income assets and six percent from other products. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Federated derived 47 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 27 percent from equity assets, 20 percent from fixed-income assets and six percent from other products.
 
At December 31, 2003, Federated recorded $268 million of additional deferred sales commission assets and an equal amount of non-recourse debt to reflect financing treatment for all 12b-1 and contingent deferred sales commissions sold under its B-share program. For comparative purposes, deferred sales commissions and non-recourse debt of $261 million, respectively, were recorded at December 31, 2002. This resulted in no impact to current or prior years' net income.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
 
For the 3 years and 5 years ended 12/31/2003, Federated Kaufmann Fund, A, B, C, and K shares were rated 5 stars and 5 stars out of 613 and 396, mid-cap growth funds, respectively. For the 10 year period ended 12/31/2003, Federated Kaufmann Fund A, B, C, and K shares were rated 4, 5, 5, and 5 stars, respectively out of 126 mid-cap growth funds. For the 3 years ended 12/31/2003, Federated Market Opportunity Fund A, B, and C shares were rated 5 stars out of 632 moderate allocation funds. For the 3 years, 5 years and 10 years ended 12/31/2003, Federated Capital Appreciation Fund, A shares, was rated 4, 4, and 5 stars, Federated Capital Appreciation Fund, B shares, was rated 4, 5, and N/A, C shares was rated 4, 5, and N/A, and K shares was rated 4, 5, and 5 stars out of 1103, 791, and 256 large blend funds, respectively. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
 
Morningstar provides adjusted historical returns and an Extended Performance Rating for some mutual funds in its universe. This means that any share class that doesn't have a 3-, 5-, or 10-year performance history may receive a hypothetical Morningstar Rating based on the oldest surviving share class of the fund. First, Morningstar computes the funds' new return stream by appending an adjusted return history of the oldest share class. Next, the Extended Performance Rating is determined by comparing the adjusted-historical returns to the current open-end mutual fund universe to identify placement in the bell curve used to assign the Morningstar Rating.

The Federated Kaufmann Fund is the successor to the Kaufmann Fund, Inc. (Kaufmann Fund) pursuant to a reorganization that took place on April 23, 2001. Prior to that date, the fund had no investment operations. Accordingly, performance information for Class A, B, and C is historical information of the Kaufmann Fund, but has been adjusted to reflect the maximum sales charge or contingent deferred sales charge and expenses applicable to the fund's Class A, B, and C shares.
 
The Class K shares of Federated Capital Appreciation Fund is a new class of shares, which commenced operations on April 7, 2003. For the period prior to the commencement of operations of the Class K shares, performance information is for the fund's Class A shares, adjusted to reflect the expenses of the Class K shares.
