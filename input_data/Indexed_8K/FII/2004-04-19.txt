Of this amount, $2.8 million represents an additional accrual of estimated costs for the company's internal review of past mutual fund trading practices and $1.5 million is for expenses including: legal fees from ongoing related lawsuits, responses to additional regulatory requests for information, costs associated with the planned transfer agency outsourcing, new compliance-related costs and other related expenses.
 
Federated's total managed assets were $193.9 billion at March 31, 2004, down $1.8 billion or one percent from $195.7 billion at March 31, 2003 and down $4.0 billion or two percent from $197.9 billion reported at December 31, 2003.

Asset growth in our equity products drove Federated's revenue growth during the quarter. We remain optimistic that the investments we've made in people and our commitment to fundamental investing processes in the equity area will lead to further success," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO.

Financial Highlights
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, revenue increased 17 percent to $227.1 million as compared to Q1 2003. Operating expenses increased 20 percent for Q1 2004 to $138.0 million from $115.2 million for Q1 2003. Increases in revenue, operating expense and debt expensenonrecourse include the result of applying financing treatment in 2004 to account for B-share distribution-related funding arrangements. The impact of financing treatment in Q1 2004 was $12.8 million of additional revenue, $9.5 million of additional operating expense and $4.5 million of additional debt expensenonrecourse. As a result of contractual changes in 2004, the increases in Federated's revenue and operating income were partially offset by the elimination of portfolio accounting revenue and expenses related to Federated-sponsored funds. First quarter 2003 included $4.1 million of revenue and $3.4 million of operating expenses that, due to the portfolio accounting contract changes, are no longer recorded effective for Q1 2004. Refer to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income contained herein for the specific line items affected.
 
For Q1 2004, Federated derived 40 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 35 percent from equity assets, 20 percent from fixed-income assets and 5 percent from other products.
