Federated Investors, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2004 Earnings
 
 
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, PA, July 26, 2004)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment management companies, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.46 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, an increase of five percent from $0.44 per share for Q2 2003 and equal to EPS of $0.46 reported for Q1 2004. Federated reported YTD 2004 EPS of $0.92 compared to $0.87 for the first six months of 2003. Net income for Q2 2004 was $50.6 million compared to net income of $49.1 million for Q2 2003. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, net income was $102.4 million compared to $97.8 million for the same period in 2003.
 
Federated's Q2 2004 net income includes expenses of $5.0 million associated with various legal, regulatory and compliance matters. Of this amount, $2.9 million represents additional costs for the company's internal review of past mutual fund trading practices and $2.1 million for expenses including: legal fees from ongoing related lawsuits, legal fees for responses to additional regulatory requests for information, costs associated with the sale of Federated's transfer agency business, new compliance-related costs and other related expenses.
 
Federated's assets under management were $183.8 billion at June 30, 2004, down nine percent from $202.4 billion at June 30, 2003, and down five percent from the $193.9 billion reported at March 31, 2004. Average managed assets for the quarter were $190.5 billion, $8.9 billion lower than the $199.4 billion reported for Q2 2003 and $9.6 billion lower than the $200.1 billion in average managed assets reported for Q1 2004.
 
"Federated's diverse revenue stream during the second quarter demonstrates the value of our broad product mix," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO. "As the anticipation and occurrence of a rising rate environment challenged the fixed-income market, and in particular money markets, Federated continued to grow equity assets and increase revenue over last year."

The company also announced today that its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.102 per share. This dividend is payable on August 13, 2004, to shareholders of record as of August 6, 2004. Federated continued its share buyback program in the second quarter by purchasing 1,403,000 shares of Federated Investors, Inc. class B common stock for $41.3 million in the open market.
 
Through its mutual funds and separate accounts, Federated managed $52.5 billion in equity and fixed-income assets as of June 30, 2004, up $1.5 billion or three percent from Q2 2003 and down $3.4 billion or six percent from Q1 2004. Equity assets ended the quarter at a record high of $26.6 billion, up $5.8 billion or 28 percent from Q2 2003 and up slightly from Q1 2004. Fixed-income assets ended the quarter at $25.9 billion, down $4.3 billion or 14 percent from Q2 2003 and down $3.6 billion or 12 percent from the end of Q1 2004.
 
Federated's equity mutual fund sales continued to be positive at $22 million on a net basis from $1.4 billion on a gross basis for Q2 2004. The company continued to produce strong flows into the Federated Kaufmann Fund, Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund and Federated Market Opportunity Fund during the quarter. Federated's fixed-income mutual funds had net redemptions of $1.8 billion for the quarter.
 
Consistent with industry trends, and due largely to the rise in market interest rates in anticipation of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve during the period, Federated's money market assets declined from both the prior quarter and on a year-over-year basis. Money market assets in both funds and separate accounts totaled $131.4 billion at June 30, 2004, down $20.0 billion or 13 percent from Q2 2003 and down $6.6 billion or five percent from Q1 2004. Average money market assets in both funds and separate accounts totaled $137.0 billion for Q2 2004, down $13.3 billion or nine percent from Q2 2003 and down $7.1 billion or five percent from Q1 2004.
 
Financial Highlights
 
For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, total revenue increased nine percent to $213.1 million from the same period in 2003. For Q2 2004, Federated derived 40 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 36 percent from equity assets, 19 percent from fixed-income assets and five percent from other products. Total revenue for the first half of 2004 increased 13 percent to $433.8 million from $383.1 million for the first half of 2003. Operating expenses increased 11 percent for Q2 2004 to $129.9 million from $117.0 million for Q2 2003. For the first half of 2004, operating expenses increased 16 percent to $262.3 million compared to $226.6 million for the same period last year.
 
Increases in revenue, operating expense and debt expensenonrecourse include the result of applying financing treatment in 2004 to account for all B-share distribution-related funding arrangements. The impact of financing treatment in Q2 2004 was approximately $12.2 million of additional revenue, $9.2 million of additional operating expense and $4.3 million of additional debt expensenonrecourse. For YTD 2004, the impact of financing treatment was approximately $25.0 million of additional

revenue, $18.7 million of additional operating expense and $8.8 million of additional debt expensenonrecourse. As a result of contractual changes in 2004, the increases in Federated's revenue and operating income were partially offset by the elimination of portfolio accounting revenue and expenses related to Federated-sponsored funds. Second quarter and the first six months of 2003 included $4.1 million and $8.2 million, respectively, of revenue and $3.4 million and $6.8 million respectively, of operating expenses that, due to the portfolio accounting contract changes, are no longer recorded effective for Q1 2004. Refer to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income contained herein for the specific line items affected.
 
Federated's financial results also reflect the sale of Federated's mutual fund transfer agency business to Boston Financial Data Services and have reclassified the results of this activity as discontinued operations. Federated's income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $0.02 per diluted share for the first half of 2004. Federated's arrangement with Boston Financial allows the firm to concentrate on its core competenciesproviding competitive investment results, powerful product distribution and top-quality customer service.
