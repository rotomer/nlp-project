ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
 
On October 28, 2004, Federated reached a definitive agreement to acquire the cash management business of Alliance Capital Management L.P. (Alliance). In connection with this acquisition, up to $29 billion in assets from 22 third-party-distributed money market funds of AllianceBernstein Cash Management Services will be transitioned into Federated money market funds. The boards of directors at both Federated and Alliance have approved the transaction, but it is still subject to approval by each mutual fund's shareholders and board of directors/trustees and customary closing considerations. This transaction, which is expected to close in phases occurring between the first and third quarters of 2005, includes upfront cash payments totaling $25 million due at the transaction closing dates as well as contingent purchase price payments payable over five years. The contingent purchase price payments will be calculated as a percentage of revenue less operating expenses directly attributed to these assets. At the current levels, these additional payments would approximate $103 million over five years. Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 is a press release issued by Federated with additional details concerning this transaction.

UPDATED: Federated Investors, Inc. to Acquire $29 Billion Cash Management Business of Alliance Capital Management L. P.
 
(PITTSBURGH, PA, October 28, 2004)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, and Alliance Capital Management L.P., a leading global investment management firm, announced today that they have reached a definitive agreement for Federated to acquire Alliance's cash management business. In connection with this acquisition, up to $29 billion in assets from 22 third-party-distributed money market funds of AllianceBernstein Cash Management Services will be transitioned into Federated money market funds. The announcement was made by Federated President and CEO J. Christopher Donahue.
 
At the completion of the transaction, which is expected to occur in phases between the first and third quarters of 2005, the assets of the 22 Alliance money market funds will be transitioned into 21 Federated money market funds with parallel investment objectives. The boards of directors at both Federated and Alliance have approved the transaction, but it is still subject to approval by each mutual fund's shareholders and board of directors/trustees and customary closing considerations.
 
The transaction includes an upfront payment by Federated of $25 million in cash and annual payments based on the level of revenue over the next five years. At the current revenue level, these additional payments would total approximately $103 million over five years. Federated's transaction with Alliance is expected to be accretive to Federated's earnings in 2005.
 
Federated managed $125.5 billion in money market assets as of September 30, 2004. At these asset levels, Federated would have combined money market assets of $154.5 billion, further solidifying its position as one of the largest money market fund managers in the country.
 
"Federated consistently serves the cash management needs of financial intermediaries, institutions and corporations and is a leader in working with organizations of all sizes as they evaluate their cash management needs," said Donahue. "Adding new clients to Federated's

of $0.43 for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, a four percent decrease from Q3 2003's EPS from continuing operations of $0.45 per share. Income from continuing operations for Q3 2004 was $47.2 million compared to income from continuing operations of $49.9 million for Q3 2003. Federated reported YTD 2004 EPS from continuing operations of $1.33, a two percent increase compared to EPS from continuing operations of $1.30 for the same period in 2003. For YTD 2004, income from continuing operations was $147.0 million compared to $146.1 million for the same period in 2003.
 
Federated's assets under management were $177.6 billion at September 30, 2004, down eight percent from $194.1 billion at September 30, 2003. Consistent with industry trends during a period of higher short-term interest rates, Federated's asset decline was due largely to lower money market and fixed income assets. Federated's equity assets increased 17 percent from Q3 2003. Total average managed assets for the quarter were $181.8 billion, $16.9 billion lower than the $198.7 billion reported for Q3 2003.
 
"In a challenging interest-rate environment, we continue to grow our customer base for cash management and to work with our clients to implement effective equity and fixed-income strategies," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO. "In addition, we are pursuing growth initiatives in a number of other areas. These include acquisitions, such as the addition of $265.5 million in assets from the Banknorth mutual funds in August, the accelerated growth of equity assets in our managed account business and the continued investment in equity management talent."
 
The company also announced today that its board of directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.125 per share, up 23 percent from the prior quarter and up 47 percent from the dividend declared a year ago. The board declared a quarterly dividend payable on November 15,

2004, to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2004. Federated continued its share buyback program in the third quarter by purchasing 1,718,400 shares of Federated Investors, Inc. class B common stock for $48.8 million in the open market. Federated's board of directors also authorized a new share repurchase program whereby the company can repurchase an additional five million shares through its share repurchase program, which will expire on December 31, 2006. With the additional shares, the company is authorized to repurchase up to 6.4 million shares.
 
Through its mutual funds and separate accounts, Federated managed $52.1 billion in equity and fixed-income assets as of September 30, 2004. Equity assets ended the quarter at $26.2 billion, up $3.9 billion from Q3 2003 and down $0.4 billion from Q2 2004. Federated's net equity mutual fund sales continued to be positive for the quarter and YTD. Net equity sales were $20 million for Q3 2004 and were $473 million for YTD 2004. The company continued to derive strong sales from the Federated Kaufmann Fund, Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund, Federated Market Opportunity Fund, Federated Capital Appreciation Fund and Federated Muni and Stock Advantage Fund during the quarter.
 
Fixed-income assets ended the quarter at $25.9 billion, down $3.5 billion or 12 percent from Q3 2003 and up slightly from the end of Q2 2004. Federated's fixed-income mutual funds had net redemptions of $823 million for Q3 2004 and $3.1 billion for YTD 2004.
 
Federated's money market assets declined during the third quarter. Money market assets in both funds and separate accounts totaled $125.5 billion at September 30, 2004, down $16.8 billion or 12 percent from Q3 2003. Average money market assets in both funds and separate accounts totaled $129.9 billion for Q3 2004, down $17.7 billion or 12 percent from Q3 2003.
 
Financial Highlights
 
For Q3 2004, Federated derived 39 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 37 percent from equity assets, 19 percent from fixed-income assets and five percent from other products and services. For the quarter ended September 30, 2004, total revenue increased slightly to $205.2 million from $203.1 million for the same quarter in 2003.

Increases in other service fees, net; amortization of deferred sales commissions; and debt expensenonrecourse include the result of applying financing treatment in 2004 to account for all B-share distribution-related funding arrangements. The impact of financing treatment in Q3 2004 was approximately $11.9 million of additional revenue, $8.9 million of additional operating expense and $4.2 million of additional debt expensenonrecourse. For YTD 2004, the impact of financing treatment was approximately $36.9 million of additional revenue, $27.6 million of additional operating expense and $12.9 million of additional debt expensenonrecourse.

As a result of certain contractual changes in 2004, the increases in Federated's revenue and operating income were partially offset by the elimination of portfolio accounting revenue and expenses related to Federated-sponsored funds. Q3 2003 and YTD 2003 included $4.2 million and $12.4 million, respectively, of revenue and $3.5 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of operating expenses that, due to the portfolio accounting contract changes, are no longer recorded effective January 1, 2004.
