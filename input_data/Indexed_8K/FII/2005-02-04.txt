Federated Investors, Inc. Announces Preliminary Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2004 Earnings Results
 
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, PA, February 3, 2005)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment management firms, today reported preliminary earnings per diluted share (EPS) from continuing operations
1
of $0.44 for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, a 16 percent increase from Q4 2003's EPS from continuing operations of $0.38. Preliminary income from continuing operations for Q4 2004 increased 15 percent to $48.3 million compared to income from continuing operations of $42.0 million for Q4 2003.
 
For the full-year 2004, Federated reported preliminary EPS from continuing operations of $1.77, an increase of five percent from $1.68 in 2003. Federated reported preliminary income from continuing operations of $195.3 million for the full-year 2004, a four percent increase from $188.1 million for 2003.
 
These earnings results are preliminary as the company is currently involved in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the New York State Attorney General to resolve issues raised by past mutual fund trading activities. The process of resolving these issues will likely result in changes to the 2004 preliminary results.
 
Federated's total managed assets were $179.3 billion at December 31, 2004, down $18.6 billion or nine percent from $197.9 billion at the end of 2003 and up from $177.6 billion at the end of Q3 2004. Average managed assets for Q4 2004 were $178.9 billion, down $20.2 billion or 10 percent from $199.1 billion reported for Q4 2003 and down $2.9 billion from $181.8 billion in average managed assets reported for Q3 2004.
 
"Federated's increase in revenue resulted from our diversified product mix as growth in equity assets under management offset decreases in money market and fixed-income assets in a period of rising short-term interest rates," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO. "In 2005, we will work toward equity and fixed-income expansion and we intend to grow our cash management business by developing new applications for our existing products and pursuing acquisition opportunities."

For comparisons to 2003, increases in other service fees, net; amortization of deferred sales commissions; and debt expensenonrecourse include the result of applying financing treatment in 2004 to account for all B-share distribution-related funding arrangements. The impact of financing treatment in Q4 2004 was approximately $12.1 million of additional revenue, $9.2 million of additional operating expense and $4.0 million of additional debt expensenonrecourse compared to Q4 2003. For 2004, the impact of financing treatment was approximately $49.0 million of additional revenue, $36.7 million of additional operating expense and $16.8 million of additional debt expensenonrecourse.
 
As a result of certain contractual changes, Federated's 2004 revenue and operating income were impacted by the elimination of portfolio accounting revenue and expenses related to Federated-sponsored funds. Q4 2003 and full-year 2003 included $4.2 million and $16.6 million, respectively, of revenue and $3.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively, of operating expenses that, due to the portfolio accounting contract changes, are no longer recorded effective January 1, 2004.
