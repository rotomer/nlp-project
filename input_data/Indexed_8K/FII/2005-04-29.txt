Federated Investors, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2005 Earnings
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, Pa., April 28, 2005)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment management companies, today reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.07 for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 compared with $0.46 per share for the same quarter last year. Income from continuing operations was $7.2 million for Q1 2005 compared to $51.2 million for Q1 2004. Federated's Q1 2005 results include a pretax charge to income of $52.9 million for various legal, regulatory and compliance matters, including an estimate of costs for the company's anticipated settlement of governmental inquiries, which reduced earnings on a net basis by $0.38 per diluted share.
 
The company continues to have discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the New York State Attorney General to resolve issues raised by past mutual fund trading activities. Federated is unable to estimate the full impact that any settlement proceedings may have on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. As a result, additional material charges may be required.
 
Federated's total managed assets were $179.0 billion at March 31, 2005, down $14.9 billion or eight percent from $193.9 billion at March 31, 2004 and down slightly from the $179.3 billion reported at December 31, 2004. Through its mutual funds and separately managed accounts, Federated managed $53.2 billion in equity and fixed-income assets as of March 31, 2005, a decrease of five percent from $55.9 billion as of March 31, 2004. Average managed assets for Q1 2005 were $179.4 billion, down $20.7 billion from $200.1 billion reported for Q1 2004 and $0.5 billion higher than the $178.9 billion in average managed assets reported for Q4 2004.
 
"While assets in Federated's fixed-income and money market portfolios have been pressured over the last year by challenging market conditions, we continue to develop new products and solutions in these areas to help our clients and we continue to devote substantial resources into growing our equity business," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO. "The additional talent that Federated has dedicated to our equity investment process helped to provide solid performance in our equity products as measured against their benchmarks and peers during the first quarter."

Federated's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. The dividend is payable on May 13, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2005. During Q1 2005, Federated purchased 674,100 shares of class B common stock for $19.4 million.
 
Federated's equity assets increased to $28.3 billion at March 31, 2005, compared to $26.4 billion at March 31, 2004, but decreased from $29.0 billion at December 31, 2004 due primarily to challenging equity market conditions during the first quarter. Federated had $1.4 billion in gross equity fund sales and $124 million in net redemptions and exchanges for Q1 2005. "Federated continued to grow our managed account business as an equity product was added to another major distribution platform and our overall gross managed account sales remained strong during the quarter," said Donahue.
 
Federated's fixed-income assets were $24.9 billion at March 31, 2005, down $4.6 billion from March 31, 2004 and down $1.1 billion from December 31, 2004. Federated had $1.5 billion in gross fixed-income fund sales and $536 million in net redemptions and exchanges for Q1 2005.
 
Money market mutual fund and money market separately managed accounts totaled $125.7 billion at the end of Q1 2005, down $12.3 billion or nine percent from $138.0 billion at the end of Q1 2004 and up $1.4 billion from $124.3 billion at the end of Q4 2004. Money market mutual fund assets decreased to $109.9 billion at the end of Q1 2005, down 10 percent from $121.8 billion at the end of Q1 2004 and down slightly from $110.6 billion at the end of Q4 2004. During Q1 2005, Federated acquired $821 million in money market mutual fund assets through a conversion associated with Federated's October 2004 agreement to acquire the cash management business of Alliance Capital Management L.P. Money market separate account assets were $15.9 billion at the end of Q1 2005, down two percent from $16.2 billion at the end of Q1 2004 and up $2.1 billion or 15 percent from the end of Q4 2004.
 
Financial Summary
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, revenue decreased seven percent to $205.9 million as compared to $220.7 million for Q1 2004, primarily due to lower revenue on fixed-income and money market products, which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from equity products. For Q1 2005, Federated derived 40 percent of its revenue from equity assets, 38 percent from money market assets, 18 percent from fixed-income assets and four percent from other products.
 
Operating expenses for Q1 2005 of $176.5 million increased $44.1 million or 33 percent from $132.4 million for Q1 2004. The increase was primarily due to a $50.6 million charge recorded in "Other" operating expenses related to management's estimate of additional costs for the company's anticipated settlement of governmental inquiries. This settlement charge was partially offset by a net decrease in other operating expense line items.
