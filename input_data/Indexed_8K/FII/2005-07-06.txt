ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
 
On June 29, 2005, Federated Investors (Federated) and Alliance Capital Management L.P. (Alliance) signed an amendment to the definitive agreement dated October 28, 2004 and filed as Exhibit 10.46 to Federated's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition to certain other changes, the amendment clarified that the payment to be made by Federated to Alliance with respect to certain transferred shareholder assets would be larger than reflected in the definitive agreement by changing the reference to "0.017 basis points" to "one hundred and seventy (170) basis points" in the definition of "Non-Tracked Client Payment." This change was made to reflect the parties' original intent and resulted in payment to Alliance of approximately $24,000.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
