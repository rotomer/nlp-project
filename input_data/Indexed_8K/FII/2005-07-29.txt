Federated Investors, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2005 Results
 
 
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, Pa., July 28, 2005)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.35 for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, compared with $0.44 for the same quarter last year. Income from continuing operations was $37.8 million for Q2 2005 compared to $48.6 million for Q2 2004.
 
Federated's Q2 2005 results include a pretax charge to income of $6.6 million for various legal, regulatory and compliance matters, including a net increase of $5.0 million to the estimate of costs for the company's anticipated settlement of governmental inquiries (Settlement Charges). Certain portions of the Settlement Charges are not tax deductible. The changes made to the Settlement Charges in Q2 2005 reduced net earnings by $0.09 per diluted share.
 
Federated's total managed assets were a period-end record $204.7 billion at June 30, 2005, up $20.9 billion or 11 percent from $183.8 billion at June 30, 2004 and up 14 percent from $179.0 billion at March 31, 2005. The increase in assets under management was due to the significant organic growth of Federated's money market assets across distribution channels and to the conversion of managed assets totaling $0.8 billion in Q1 2005 and $18.5 billion in Q2 2005 related to Federated's acquisition of Alliance Capital Management L.P.'s cash management assets.
 
"Federated experienced money market asset growth in each of its major distribution channels during the second quarter," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO. "We are optimistic about continuing to grow this part of our business, both organically and through acquisitions such as the Alliance transaction."
 
Federated's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. The dividend is payable on August 15, 2005, to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2005.

Money market separate account assets were $14.6 billion at the end of Q2 2005, up six percent from $13.8 billion at the end of Q2 2004 and down eight percent from the end of Q1 2005, due largely to seasonality.
 
Financial Summary
 
For the quarter ended June 30, 2005, revenue increased four percent to a record $221.3 million compared to $213.1 million for Q2 2004. Revenue growth during the quarter was due primarily to a $13.6 million increase from the conversion of the Alliance money market assets and a $7.3 million increase derived from increased average equity assets. These revenue increases were partially offset by a $10.6 million decline in revenues derived from decreased fixed-income and money market average assets (excluding the money market assets acquired from Alliance). For Q2 2005, Federated derived 42 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 38 percent from equity assets, 17 percent from fixed-income assets and three percent from other sources.
