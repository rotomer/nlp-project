Federated Investors, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2005 Results
 
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, Pa., October 27, 2005)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.61 for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2005, compared with $0.43 for the same quarter last year. Federated's Q3 and YTD 2005 financial results include an insurance reimbursement of $23.6 million, or $0.14 per diluted share after tax, related to costs incurred for various legal, regulatory and compliance matters. Income from continuing operations was $65.5 million for Q3 2005 compared to $47.5 million for Q3 2004.
 
Federated's total managed assets were a period-end record $207.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2005, up $29.8 billion or 17 percent from $177.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2004, and up one percent from $204.7 billion at June 30, 2005. The increase in assets under management was due primarily to increases in money market assets and market appreciation in equity products.
 
"Federated continues to offer new and innovative portfolio solutions to address the needs of investors seeking diversified sources of income," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO. "During the quarter, Federated Strategic Value Fund, which launched in March 2005 and is based on a separately managed account strategy, topped $100 million in assets."
 
Federated's board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. The dividend is payable on Nov. 15, 2005 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 8, 2005.
 
Through its mutual funds and separately managed accounts, Federated managed $53.5 billion in equity and fixed-income assets at Sept. 30, 2005, a three percent increase from $52.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2004. Average managed assets for Q3 2005 were $208.1 billion, up $26.3 billion from $181.8 billion reported for Q3 2004 and $15.0 billion higher than the $193.1 billion reported for Q2 2005.
 
Federated's equity assets increased to $29.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2005, compared to $28.9 billion at June 30, 2005, and $26.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2004. For Q3 2005, Federated had $1.2 billion in gross equity fund sales and $1.9 billion in gross equity fund redemptions and exchanges resulting in $707 million in net equity fund redemptions and exchanges. The top selling equity funds, on a net basis, were Federated Muni and Stock Advantage Fund, Federated Market Opportunity Fund, Federated Strategic Value Fund and Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund.

Separately managed account product sales continued to be led by the Strategic Value strategy.
 
Federated's fixed-income assets were $23.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2005, down $0.6 billion from June 30, 2005, and down $2.1 billion from Sept. 30, 2004. For Q3 2005, Federated had $1.2 billion in gross fixed-income fund sales and $1.6 billion in gross fixed-income fund redemptions and exchanges resulting in $467 million in net fixed-income fund redemptions and exchanges. The top selling fixed-income funds, on a net basis, were Federated Total Return Bond Fund, Federated Municipal High Yield Advantage Fund, Inc., Federated Strategic Income Fund and Federated Mortgage Fund.
 
Money market assets totaled a record $154.0 billion at the end of Q3 2005, up $28.5 billion or 23 percent from $125.5 billion at the end of Q3 2004 and up $2.6 billion or two percent from $151.4 billion at the end of Q2 2005. Money market mutual fund assets increased to $139.6 billion at the end of Q3 2005, up 24 percent from $112.7 billion at the end of Q3 2004 and up two percent from $136.9 billion at the end of Q2 2005. Money market separate account assets were $14.4 billion at the end of Q3 2005, up 13 percent from $12.8 billion at the end of Q3 2004 and down one percent from $14.6 billion at the end of Q2 2005.
 
Financial Summary
 
For the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2005, revenue increased 18 percent to $241.4 million compared to $204.4 million for Q3 2004. Major drivers of revenue growth during the quarter included increased average money market assets resulting from Federated's acquisition of Alliance Capital Management L.P.'s cash management assets in Q2 2005, growth of average equity assets and organic growth of money market assets, which generated $25.5 million, $12.3 million and $6.7 million in revenue, respectively. These revenue increases were partially offset by a $3.8 million decline in revenue from fixed-income products due to an eight percent decrease in average fixed-income assets. For Q3 2005, Federated derived 46 percent of its total revenue from money market assets, 37 percent from equity assets, 15 percent from fixed-income assets and two percent from other sources.
 
Operating expenses for Q3 2005 of $133.1 million increased $10.5 million or nine percent from $122.6 million for Q3 2004. The increase was due primarily to $20.7 million in marketing and distribution expenses resulting from new assets acquired in connection with the Alliance acquisition. Operating expenses for Q3 also included the $23.6 million insurance reimbursement, which was recorded as a reduction to the income statement line items where the costs were initially recorded.
 
Federated's financial results reflect the sale of InvestLink Technologies, Inc. to Bluff Point LLC. The results of this sale and InvestLink's operations for all periods presented have been classified as discontinued operations. For Q3 2005, Federated reported a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $1.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share.
