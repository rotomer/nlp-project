$36 billion or nearly 30 percent through acquisitions and organic growth, " said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO. "As we get closer to the end of the rate tightening cycle, we expect to see increased demand for Federated's money market products in 2006."
 
The company also announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. The dividend is payable on Feb. 15, 2006 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 8, 2006. During Q4 2005, Federated purchased 165,042 shares of class B common stock for $6.0 million. For 2005, the company purchased 920,103 shares for $25.5 million.
 
Money market assets in both funds and separate accounts totaled a record $160.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2005, $36.3 billion or 29 percent more than $124.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2004 and up from $154.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2005. Average money market assets in both funds and separate accounts were $157.4 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2005, compared to $125.3 billion for the same period last year and $154.4 billion for Q3 2005. Average money market fund assets of $143.7 billion for Q4 2005 increased from $112.4 billion for Q4 2004 and from $140.1 billion for the prior quarter.
 
As a result of increases in net asset values, equity assets increased to $29.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2005, compared to $29.0 billion at the end of 2004 and $29.7 billion at the end of Q3 2005. Among equity funds, Federated had strong net sales during the quarter in the Federated Strategic Value Fund, a value fund; Federated Market Opportunity Fund, a contrarian value fund; Federated Muni and Stock Advantage Fund, a tax-advantaged income fund; and Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund, a small-cap growth fund. Additionally, driven by strong net sales, Federated's managed account equity products increased to $1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2005 from $1.1 billion at the end of 2004.
 
Through its mutual funds and separate accounts, Federated managed $52.8 billion in equity and fixed-income assets at Dec. 31, 2005, down $2.2 billion from $55.0 billion at the end of 2004. Fixed-income assets were $23.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2005, down $2.9 billion from the end of 2004 and down $0.8 billion from Q3 2005. Rising short-term interest rates had a negative effect on net sales in 2005 as redemptions continued in Federated's ultrashort products.

For 2005, Federated derived 43 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 38 percent from equity assets, 16 percent from fixed-income assets and three percent from other products and services.

Total revenue for 2005 increased eight percent to $909.2 million compared to $843.3 million for 2004.

Operating expenses increased nine percent for Q4 2005 to $155.5 million from $142.7 million for Q4 2004 due primarily to increased marketing and distribution and amortization of intangible assets associated with the Alliance Acquisition, which were partially offset by decreased costs for various legal, regulatory and compliance matters. Operating expenses for 2005 increased 16 percent to $610.2 million compared to $525.4 million for 2004 due to increased costs related to the Alliance Acquisition as mentioned above and increased costs for various legal, regulatory and compliance matters.
