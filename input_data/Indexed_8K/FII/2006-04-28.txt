Federated's income from continuing operations was $0.43 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 compared with $0.06 per share for the same quarter last year. Income from continuing operations was $46.1 million for Q1 2006 compared to $6.8 million for Q1 2005.
Federated's total managed assets were $217.5 billion at March 31, 2006, up $38.5 billion or 22 percent from $179.0 billion at March 31, 2005 and up $4.1 billion or 2 percent from the $213.4 billion reported at Dec. 31, 2005. Through its mutual funds and separately managed accounts, Federated managed $53.9 billion in equity and fixed-income assets as of March 31, 2006, a 1 percent increase from $53.2 billion as of March 31, 2005.

Financial Summary
For Q1 2006, revenue increased $36.9 million or 18 percent to $238.8 million as compared to $201.9 million for the same quarter last year, primarily due to Federated's acquisition of Alliance Capital Management L.P.'s cash management business in 2005 and to organic growth in money market assets. Higher equity assets also led to the increase in revenue, partially offset by lower fixed income assets. Revenue for Q1 2006 included the impact of $1.0 million in advisory-fee reductions implemented Jan. 1, 2006 related to the company's settlement with the New York State Attorney General. For Q1 2006, Federated derived 47 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 38 percent from equity assets, 14 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products.

Operating expenses for Q1 2006 of $164.6 million decreased by $8.7 million or 5 percent from $173.3 million for Q1 2005. Marketing and distribution expense was affected primarily by higher expenses related to the Alliance acquisition.
Discontinued operations for Q1 2006 reflects $1.0 million or $0.01 per share of primarily after-tax operating income related to Federated's trade-clearing operation, which the company began to divest in Q1 2006, and $1.8 million or $0.02 per share for the reversal of a tax-valuation allowance for the portion of Federated's capital loss carryforwards that will likely be realized as a result of the capital gain expected on the sale of the trade-clearing operation.
