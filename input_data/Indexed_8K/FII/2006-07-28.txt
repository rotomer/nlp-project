Financial Summary
For Q2 2006, revenue increased $18.7 million or 9 percent to $236.4 million compared to $217.7 million for the same quarter last year, primarily due to Federated's acquisition of Alliance Capital Management L.P.'s cash management business, organic money market growth and increased equity assets under management.

percent to $325.4 million compared to $317.3 million for the same period last year. Increases in operating expenses were affected by higher marketing and distribution expenses associated with the Alliance acquisition and increased compensation and related expenses.
