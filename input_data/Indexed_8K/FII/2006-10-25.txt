(1) Basis of presentation
On July 14, 2006, Federated Investors, Inc. (Federated) completed the acquisition of MDTA LLC (MDTA) (Acquisition). Federated acquired approximately 89 percent of the outstanding equity interests of MDTA with a right to acquire the remaining 11 percent by June 30, 2007. The transaction includes an initial purchase payment of approximately $102 million, an additional purchase price payment of approximately $8 million in the first half of 2007 upon acquisition of the remaining 11 percent outstanding equity interests and a series of contingent payments totaling as much as $130 million over the next three years based on growth. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase under U.S. GAAP.
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2006 has been prepared to give effect to the acquisition as if such transaction occurred on March 31, 2006. The unaudited statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2006, and for the year ended December 31, 2005, have been prepared to give effect to the Acquisition as if such transaction occurred at the beginning of the periods presented.
The following is a description of the individual columns included in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements:
The information presented as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2006, was derived from Federated's unaudited historical consolidated financial statements. The information for the year ended December 31, 2005, was derived from Federated's audited consolidated financial statements for 2005.
Federated:
The information presented as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2006, was derived from MDTA's unaudited historical financial statements. The information for the year ended December 31, 2005, was derived from MDTA's audited financial statements for 2005. Information presented in this column includes certain reclassifications to conform MDTA's financial statements with Federated's presentation.
MDTA LLC:
The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual adjustments to record the purchase could be different. The adjustments represent adjustments that are either directly attributable to the Acquisition or otherwise required by Article 11 of Regulation S-X to conform accounting treatment across all periods presented. These adjustments are considered to have a continuing impact on the financial position and results of operations of Federated.
Pro Forma Adjustments:
 
These unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are provided for informational purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the actual financial position or results of operations had such transaction been completed on the dates indicated or of future results of operations. In addition, the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements do not include any synergies that may be realized as a result of combining the entities.
These unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Federated's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2006, and June 30, 2006, and Current Report on Form 8-K as amended filed July 20, 2006.
