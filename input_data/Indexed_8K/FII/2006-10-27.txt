(PITTSBURGH, Pa., October 26, 2006)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (EPS) of $0.43 for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2006. Federated's Q3 2006 financial results include a charge of $2.3 million pre-tax, or $0.01 per share after tax, related to the estimated cost of distributing Federated's 2005 regulatory settlement amount. For Q3 2005, Federated reported EPS of $0.60, which included the recognition of an insurance reimbursement of $23.6 million, or $0.14 per share after tax. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2006, Federated reported EPS of $1.29 compared to $1.01 for the same period in 2005.
Federated's income from continuing operations was $45.2 million for Q3 2006 compared to $64.8 million for Q3 2005. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2006, income from continuing operations was $137.9 million compared to $109.6 million for the same period in 2005.
Federated's total managed assets reached a record $222.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2006, up $15.3 billion or 7 percent from $207.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2005 and up $12.2 billion or 6 percent from the $210.5 billion reported at June 30, 2006. Through its mutual funds and separately managed accounts, Federated managed a record $59.9 billion in equity and fixed-income assets as of Sept. 30, 2006, a $6.4 billion or 12 percent increase from $53.5 billion as of Sept. 30, 2005. Average managed assets for Q3 2006 were $219.7 billion, up $11.6 billion or 6 percent from $208.1 billion reported for Q3 2005 and up $5.8 billion or 3 percent from $213.9 billion in average managed assets reported for Q2 2006.

"During the quarter, Federated's equity assets under management grew by nearly $8 billion to over $38 billion at the end of the quarter due to our acquisition of MDTA, improving equity product sales and market appreciation," said President and CEO J. Christopher Donahue. "In addition, Federated grew its money market assets under management as demand increased among broker/dealer and trust clients. With a backdrop of a more favorable interest rate environment, we believe that we will continue to grow money market assets over time."

Revenue for the first nine months of 2006 increased $61.5 million or 9 percent to $719.1 million compared to $657.6 million for the first nine months of 2005, primarily due to the acquisition of the cash management business of Alliance Capital Management L.P.

insurance reimbursement related to costs incurred for various legal, regulatory and compliance matters. For Q3 2006, as compared to Q3 2005, other increases to operating expenses were caused primarily by the marketing and distribution expenses related to the acquisition of MDTA LLC ($5.8 million) and increased money market ($5.3 million) and equity ($1.2 million) assets. For YTD 2006, operating expenses increased by $47.2 million or 11 percent to $495.4 million compared to $448.2 million for the same period last year. Increases in YTD 2006 operating expenses, as compared to YTD 2005, were caused primarily by the above-mentioned insurance reimbursement; the Alliance acquisition ($37.9 million); the marketing and distribution expenses related to increased equity ($4.3 million) and money market ($12.9 million) assets; and the acquisition of MDTA LLC ($5.8 million). These increases were partially offset by the $55.6 million of regulatory settlement expense, which was recorded in the first half of 2005.
