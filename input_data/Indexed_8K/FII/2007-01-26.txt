For the year ended Dec. 31, 2006, Federated reported EPS of $1.80 compared to $1.49 for 2005.
Federated's income from continuing operations was $53.1 million for Q4 2006 compared to $51.4 million for Q4 2005. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2006, income from continuing operations was $191.0 million compared to $161.0 million for 2005.
Federated's total managed assets reached a record $237.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2006, up $24.0 billion or 11 percent from $213.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2005 and up $14.7 billion or 7 percent from $222.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2006. Through its mutual funds and separate accounts, Federated managed a record $63.8 billion in equity and fixed-income assets as of Dec. 31, 2006, an $11.0 billion or 21 percent increase from $52.8 billion as of Dec. 31, 2005 and a $3.9 billion or 7 percent increase from $59.9 billion as of Sept. 30, 2006.

"Catalysts for Federated's equity asset growth during 2006 included strong equity market conditions in the second half of the year, the acquisition of MDTA LLC (MDT) and improved performance in some of our key equity products," said President and CEO J. Christopher Donahue. "Additionally, as money market yields increased over the course of the year, Federated continued to see growth in its money market assets as demand increased among broker/dealers and trust clients."
The company also announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share. The dividend is payable on Feb. 15, 2007 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 8, 2007.

Financial Summary
For Q4 2006, revenue increased $21.1 million or 9 percent to $259.7 million compared to $238.6 million for the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily due to increases in revenue from average money market assets under management ($9.4 million); increases in average equity assets under management due to the acquisition of MDT ($8.4 million); and increases in average equity assets under management beyond MDT ($8.6 million). The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from average fixed-income assets under management ($3.2 million). For Q4 2006, Federated derived 47 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 40 percent from equity assets, 12 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Revenue for 2006 increased $82.7 million or 9 percent to $978.9 million compared to $896.2 million for 2005, primarily due to the acquisition of the cash management business of Alliance Capital Management L.P. ($43.2 million) and other increases in average money market assets under management ($27.6 million); increases in average equity assets under management due to the acquisition of MDT ($15.2 million); and increases in average equity assets under management beyond MDT ($27.5 million). The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from average fixed-income assets under management ($18.0 million). For 2006, Federated derived 47 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 39 percent from equity assets, 13 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.

Operating expenses for Q4 2006 increased by $21.8 million or 14 percent to $175.0 million, compared to $153.2 million for Q4 2005. This increase in operating expenses was caused primarily by marketing and distribution expenses related to increased money market assets ($7.5 million); expenses related to MDT ($6.0 million), which was acquired in July 2006; and increased incentive compensation ($3.3 million).
For 2006, operating expenses increased by $69.1 million or 11 percent to $670.4 million compared to $601.3 million for 2005. Operating expenses for 2005 included the recognition of a $23.6 million insurance reimbursement related to costs incurred for various legal, regulatory and compliance matters, which primarily reduced professional service fee expenses. Other increases in 2006 operating expenses, as compared to 2005, were caused primarily by marketing and distribution expenses related to both the Alliance acquisition ($36.3 million) and other increases in money market assets ($19.8 million); as well as increases to various operating expenses due to the MDT acquisition ($11.7 million).
