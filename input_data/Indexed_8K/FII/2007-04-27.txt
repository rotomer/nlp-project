(NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $0.50 for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, compared to $0.43 for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, an increase of 16 percent. Federated's income from continuing operations was $51.8 million for Q1 2007 compared to $46.1 million for Q1 2006.

Federated's total managed assets were a record $250.5 billion at March 31, 2007, up $33.0 billion or 15 percent from $217.5 billion at March 31, 2006 and up $13.1 billion or 6 percent from the $237.4 billion reported at Dec. 31, 2006. Through its mutual funds and separately managed accounts, Federated managed $64.5 billion in equity and fixed-income assets as of March 31, 2007, a 20 percent increase from $53.9 billion as of March 31, 2006.

"At the end of the quarter, 69 percent of Federated's domestic stock-fund assets outperformed their Lipper category averages on a one-year basis, which is a noteworthy performance improvement from a year ago," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and CEO. "Federated continues to strengthen our equity management capacitymost recently through our agreement with Rochdale Investment Management to acquire certain assets related to the strong-performing Rochdale Atlas Portfolio and to hire two members of that fund's investment management team."
Federated's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, an increase of 17 percent from $0.18 per share last quarter.

Federated's fixed-income assets were $23.2 billion at March 31, 2007, up $0.9 billion or 4 percent from $22.3 billion at March 31, 2006 and up slightly from $22.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2006.

Money market assets in both funds and separate accounts were a record $186.0 billion at March 31, 2007, up $22.4 billion or 14 percent from $163.6 billion at March 31, 2006 and up $12.4 billion or 7 percent from $173.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2006. Money market mutual fund assets increased to a record $163.8 billion at the end of Q1 2007, up $17.8 billion or 12 percent from $146.0 billion at March 31, 2006 and up $8.6 billion or 6 percent from $155.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2006.
Financial Summary
For Q1 2007, revenue increased $25.6 million or 11 percent to $264.4 million compared to $238.8 million for the same quarter last year. The increase in revenue is primarily due to increases in revenue from average money market managed assets ($14.3 million); increases in average equity managed assets due to the MDT acquisition ($9.1 million); and increases in remaining average equity managed assets ($6.2 million). The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from a change in the asset mix of average fixed-income managed assets ($2.6 million). For Q1 2007, Federated derived 48 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 40 percent from equity assets, 11 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for Q1 2007 increased by $16.0 million or 10 percent to $180.6 million, compared to $164.6 million for Q1 2006. This increase in operating expenses was caused primarily by marketing and distribution expenses related to increased money market managed assets ($8.8 million) and operating expenses related to MDT ($6.9 million).
