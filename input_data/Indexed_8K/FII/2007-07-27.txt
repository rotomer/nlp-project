Financial Summary
For Q2 2007, revenue increased by $40.1 million or 17 percent to a record $276.5 million compared to $236.4 million for the same quarter last year. The increase in revenue is primarily due to increases in revenue from average money market managed assets ($21.9 million); increases in average equity managed assets due to the MDT acquisition ($10.0 million); and increases in remaining average equity managed assets ($9.7 million). The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from a change in the asset mix of average fixed-income managed assets ($1.1 million). For Q2 2007, Federated derived 48 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 40 percent from equity assets, 11 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Revenue for the first half of 2007 increased $65.7 million or 14 percent to $540.9 million compared to $475.2 million for the first half of 2006. The YTD revenue increase is primarily due to increases in revenue from average money market managed assets ($35.9 million); increases in average equity managed assets due to the MDT acquisition ($19.0 million); and increases in remaining average equity managed assets ($15.8 million). The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from a change in the asset mix of average fixed-income managed assets ($3.7 million). For YTD 2007, Federated derived 48 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 40 percent from equity assets, 11 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.

Operating expenses for Q2 2007 increased by $26.8 million or 17 percent to $187.6 million compared to $160.8 million for Q2 2006. The increase in operating expenses was caused primarily by marketing and distribution expenses related to increased money market managed assets ($13.4 million) and direct operating expenses related to the MDT acquisition ($6.4 million). For the first half of 2007, operating expense increased by $42.9 million or 13 percent to $368.3 million compared to $325.4 million for the same period last year. Higher marketing and distribution expenses related to increased money market managed assets ($22.3 million) and the direct operating expenses of MDT ($13.3 million) drove YTD increases in operating expenses.
