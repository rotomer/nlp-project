Financial Summary
For Q3 2007, revenue increased by $42.1 million or 17 percent to a record $286.0 million compared to $243.9 million for the same quarter last year. The increase in revenue is primarily due to increases in revenue from average money market managed assets ($28.3 million) and increases in average equity managed assets ($16.2 million). The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from a change in the asset mix of average fixed-income managed assets ($1.6 million). For Q3 2007, Federated derived 50 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 39 percent from equity assets, 10 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Revenue for the first nine months of 2007 increased $107.8 million or 15 percent to $826.9 million compared to $719.1 million for the same period in 2006. The YTD revenue increase is primarily due to increases in revenue from average money market managed assets ($64.6 million); increases in average equity managed assets due to the July 2006 acquisition of MDT Advisers ($23.5 million); and increases in remaining average equity managed assets ($26.7 million). The revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from a change in the mix of average fixed-income managed assets ($5.2 million). For YTD 2007, Federated derived 49 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 39 percent from equity assets, 11 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for Q3 2007 increased by $18.2 million or 11 percent to $188.2 million compared to $170.0 million for Q3 2006. The increase in operating expenses was caused primarily by marketing and distribution expenses related to increased average money market managed assets ($15.8 million) and increased incentive compensation expense ($4.2 million).

For the first nine months of 2007, operating expenses increased by $61.1 million or 12 percent to $556.5 million compared to $495.4 million for the same period last year. Higher marketing and distribution expenses related to increased average money market managed assets ($37.9 million); the direct operating expenses of MDT ($13.7 million); and increases in other incentive compensation expense ($7.8 million) drove YTD increases in operating expenses.
Nonoperating expenses increased $4.2 million and $5.6 million for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2007, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2006. These increases were primarily related to a non-recurring $4.9 million, pre-tax, or $2.8 million after-tax investment loss incurred in a Federated-sponsored private placement product during Q3 2007.
