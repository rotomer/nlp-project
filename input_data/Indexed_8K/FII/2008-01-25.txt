and a $1.2 million pre-tax charge, or approximately $0.01 per share after tax, related to a write-down on the firm's investment in a Federated-managed collateralized debt obligation product. Federated's income from continuing operations was $52.7 million for Q4 2007 compared to $53.1 million for Q4 2006.
For the year ended Dec. 31, 2007, Federated reported EPS of $2.12 compared to $1.80 for 2006. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2007, income from continuing operations was $217.5 million compared to $191.0 million for 2006.
Federated's total managed assets reached a record $301.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2007, up $64.2 billion or 27 percent from $237.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2006 and up $25.4 billion or 9 percent from $276.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2007. The increase in total managed assets was due in large part to a $63.0 billion increase in money market assets during 2007. Average managed assets for Q4 2007 were $290.1 billion, up $58.4 billion or 25 percent from $231.7 billion reported for Q4 2006 and up $22.5 billion or 8 percent from $267.6 billion reported for Q3 2007.
"Federated's unprecedented money market asset growth during 2007 demonstrated the confidence that our fund shareholders have in the stability of our money market funds," said President and CEO J. Christopher Donahue. "Federated's history of strong credit analysis has served us well in the recent environment for money market funds."

Financial Summary
For Q4 2007, revenue increased $40.6 million or 16 percent to $300.3 million compared to $259.7 million for the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily due to increases in revenue from average money market assets under management ($34.0 million) and from average equity assets under management ($9.9 million). The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from a change in the mix of average fixed-income assets under management ($1.8 million). For Q4 2007, Federated derived 52 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 37 percent from equity assets, 10 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Revenue for 2007 increased $148.8 million or 15 percent to $1.1 billion compared to $978.9 million for 2006 primarily due to increases in average money market assets under management ($98.6 million); increases in average equity assets under management primarily related to the July 2006 acquisition of MDT Advisers ($26.8 million); and increases in remaining average equity assets under management ($33.3 million). The increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from a change in the mix of average fixed-income assets under management ($6.9 million). For 2007, Federated derived 49 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 39 percent from equity assets, 11 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.

Operating expenses for Q4 2007 increased by $39.0 million or 22 percent to $214.0 million compared to $175.0 million for Q4 2006. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in marketing and distribution expenses related to increased average money market managed assets ($17.7 million); the previously mentioned increase in compensation expense for new employment agreements with certain Federated Kaufmann employees ($15 million); and an increase in other incentive compensation expense ($4.0 million).
For 2007, operating expenses increased by $100.1 million or 15 percent to $770.5 million compared to $670.4 million for 2006. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in marketing and distribution expenses related to increased average money market managed assets ($55.6 million); the direct operating expenses of MDT Advisers, which Federated acquired in July 2006 ($15.0 million); the previously mentioned increase in compensation expense for new employment agreements with certain Federated Kaufmann employees ($15 million); and an increase in other increased incentive compensation expense ($10.9 million).
Nonoperating expenses increased $6.6 million in 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was primarily related to a non-recurring $4.9 million investment loss incurred in a Federated-sponsored private placement product during Q3 2007 and the previously mentioned $1.2 million write-down in Q4 2007 related to the firm's investment in a Federated-managed collateralized debt obligation product.
