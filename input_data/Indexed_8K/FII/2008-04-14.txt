Federated Investors, Inc. Reports Preliminary First Quarter 2008 Financial Results
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, Pa., April 14, 2008)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported preliminary earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.55 for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, compared to $0.50 reported for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, an increase of 10 percent. Federated's preliminary net income was $56 million for Q1 2008 compared to $52 million for Q1 2007, an increase of 8 percent. These results and explanations are preliminary and are subject to change.
Federated's total managed assets were a record $338.5 billion at March 31, 2008. The increase in total managed assets was driven by a $40.9 billion increase in money market assets during Q1 2008. Federated's equity assets declined $4.6 billion to $37.5 billion mainly due to market depreciation. Average managed assets were $322.0 billion for the quarter with average money market assets of $260.3 billion, average equity assets of $38.5 billion and average fixed-income assets of $23.2 billion.
For Q1 2008, revenue increased $41.3 million or 16 percent to $305.7 million compared to $264.4 million for the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in revenue from average money market assets under management ($47.9 million) and the impact of the leap year on Q1 2008 compared to Q1 2007 ($2.3 million) partially offset by an increase in fee waivers due to higher fund expenses ($3.7 million), a decrease in revenue from average equity assets under management ($3.6 million) and a change in the mix of average fixed-income assets under management ($1.2 million).
Compared to the prior quarter, total revenue increased by $5.4 million or 2 percent. The increase is primarily due to an increase in revenue from average money market assets under management ($23.0 million) partially offset by a decrease in revenue from average equity assets under management ($11.0 million), one fewer day in Q1 2008 as compared to Q4 2007 ($4.3 million) and an increase in fee waivers due to higher fund expenses ($1.9 million). For Q1 2008, Federated derived 56 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 33 percent from equity assets, 10 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.

Operating expenses for Q1 2008 increased $34.2 million or 19 percent to $214.8 million compared to $180.6 million for Q1 2007. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in marketing and distribution expenses related to increased average money market managed assets ($24.2 million) and increased regular and incentive compensation expenses ($6.9 million).
Compared to Q4 2007, operating expenses increased slightly. Compensation and related expenses decreased $9.7 million in Q1 2008 as compared to Q4 2007. The prior quarter included $15 million in compensation expenses related to new employment agreements with certain Federated Kaufmann employees and Q1 2008 included $1.7 million in new compensation for Federated Kaufmann personnel. In addition, Q1 2008 compensation was higher due to $1.8 million for seasonally higher payroll tax and employee benefit expenses, $1.2 million due to higher base pay expenses and $1.2 million in additional expense related to 2007 incentive pay. Overall, marketing and distribution expense increased by $11.5 million for the consecutive quarter comparison. Of this amount, $10.6 million was due to higher average money market managed assets and, to a lesser extent, changes in the terms of distribution contracts with certain intermediary customers. Q1 2008 marketing and distribution expense was also affected by one fewer day compared to the prior quarter, resulting in $1.2 million less in these expenses.
In Q1 2008, Federated purchased 68,684 shares of Federated Investors, Inc. class B common stock for $2.1 million.
