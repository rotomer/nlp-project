Federated Investors, Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2008 Earnings
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, Pa., July 24, 2008)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.58 for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. These results include net earnings of $2.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share classified as income from discontinued operations, net of tax, related to the sale of the company's trade-clearing operation in 2006. Federated's EPS from continuing operations was $0.55 for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 compared to $0.54 for the same quarter last year. Income from continuing operations was $55.2 million for Q2 2008 compared to $55.3 million for Q2 2007. The Q2 2008 results include pre-tax expenses of $2.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share after tax and $1.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share after tax related to estimated additional costs for the distribution of Federated's 2005 regulatory settlement and for modification of certain mutual fund prospectuses, respectively.
Federated reported YTD 2008 EPS from continuing operations of $1.10 compared to $1.04 for the same period in 2007, an increase of 6 percent. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, income from continuing operations was $111.0 million compared to $107.0 million for the same period in 2007.
Federated's total managed assets were $333.5 billion at June 30, 2008, up $73.8 billion or 28 percent from $259.7 billion at June 30, 2007 and down $5.0 billion or 1 percent from the $338.5 billion reported at March 31, 2008. Money market assets decreased from the end of last quarter due mainly to seasonal outflows among separate accounts, while overall, average money market assets in Q2 2008 were higher than in Q1 2008. Total average managed assets for Q2 2008 were $343.3 billion, up $87.2 billion or 34 percent from $256.1 billion reported for Q2 2007 and up $21.3 billion or 7 percent from $322.0 billion reported for Q1 2008.

Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer. "Federated saw strong flows into its bond funds, where year-to-date net flows topped $1 billion."

Financial Summary
Q2 2008 vs. Q2 2007
For Q2 2008, revenue increased $33.8 million or 12 percent to $310.3 million compared to $276.5 million for the same quarter last year. The increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in revenue from average money market managed assets ($48.3 million). The increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from average equity managed assets ($9.9 million) and a change in the mix of average fixed-income managed assets ($0.8 million). For Q2 2008, Federated derived 58 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 32 percent from equity assets, 9 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for Q2 2008 increased $31.5 million or 17 percent to $219.1 million compared to $187.6 million for Q2 2007. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher marketing and distribution expenses of $23.1 million primarily from higher average money market managed assets. In addition, compensation expenses increased by $7.4 million primarily due to higher incentive compensation. The increase in operating expenses for Q2 2008 compared to Q2 2007 included

two notable items. The first item was $2.0 million in additional expense related to Federated's estimated costs for the distribution of the firm's 2005 regulatory settlement. The second item was a $1.8 million expense related to the cost of modifying certain money market fund prospectuses in order to broaden the scope of allowable investments.
Q2 2008 vs. Q1 2008
Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased by $4.6 million or 2 percent. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from average money market managed assets ($8.6 million). The revenue increase was partially offset by a decrease resulting from a change in the mix of average equity managed assets ($1.5 million) and Federated voluntarily waiving an additional $1.2 million in fund revenue for competitive reasons.
Compared to Q1 2008, operating expenses increased by $4.3 million or 2 percent. Professional service fees increased $2.9 million primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in estimated costs related to the distribution of Federated's 2005 regulatory settlement and $0.9 million related to the aforementioned prospectus modification. Marketing and distribution expenses increased by $2.7 million over Q1 2008 primarily due to higher average money market managed assets.
YTD 2008 vs. YTD 2007
Revenue for the first half of the year increased $75.1 million or 14 percent to $616.0 million compared to $540.9 million for the same time period last year. The increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in revenue from average money market managed assets ($95.8 million). The increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from average equity managed assets ($13.5 million), a change in the mix of average fixed-income managed assets ($1.9 million) and Federated voluntarily waiving an additional $4.7 million in fund revenue for competitive reasons.
Operating expenses for the year-to-date period ended June 30, 2008 increased $65.6 million or 18 percent to $433.8 million compared to $368.2 million for the same period of last year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in marketing and distribution expenses of $50.6 million, primarily related to increased average money market managed assets. In addition, compensation and related expenses increased by $14.8 million primarily due to higher incentive compensation.
