Financial Summary
Q3 2008 vs. Q3 2007
For Q3 2008, revenue increased $19.5 million or 7 percent to $305.9 million compared to $286.4 million for the same quarter last year. The increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in revenue from average money market managed assets ($42.0 million) and average fixed-income assets ($0.4 million). The increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from average equity managed assets ($20.2 million). For Q3 2008, Federated derived 60 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 30 percent from equity assets, 9 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for Q3 2008 increased $24.5 million or 13 percent to $212.7 million compared to $188.2 million for Q3 2007. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher marketing and distribution expenses of $15.9 million primarily from higher average money market managed assets. In addition, compensation and related expenses increased by $8.4 million.

Q3 2008 vs. Q2 2008
Compared to the prior quarter, revenue decreased by $4.4 million or 1 percent. The revenue decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average equity managed assets ($8.8 million), partially offset by the impact of one additional day in the third quarter ($3.5 million).
Compared to Q2 2008, operating expenses decreased by $6.4 million or 3 percent. Marketing and distribution expenses decreased $3.7 million from Q2 2008 primarily due to lower average money market and equity managed assets. In addition, professional service fees decreased $1.2 million.
Nonoperating expenses increased $1.2 million compared to the prior quarter due mainly to an increase in mark-to-market investment losses and an increase in recourse debt expense.
YTD 2008 vs. YTD 2007
Revenue for the first nine months of 2008 increased $94.5 million or 11 percent to $921.9 million compared to $827.4 million for the same period last year. The increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in revenue from average money market managed assets ($137.7 million). The increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from average equity managed assets ($33.6 million), a decrease due to a change in the mix of average fixed-income managed assets ($1.5 million) and an increase in the amount of fund revenue that was voluntarily waived for competitive reasons ($5.3 million).
For YTD 2008, Federated derived 58 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 31 percent from equity assets, 10 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.

The increase in operating expenses was attributable to a $66.5 million increase in marketing and distribution expenses related primarily to increased average money market managed assets. Additionally, compensation and related expenses increased $23.1 million.
Nonoperating expenses for YTD 2008 decreased $2.9 million or 71 percent to $1.2 million compared to $4.1 million for the same period in 2007 due to lower investment losses.
