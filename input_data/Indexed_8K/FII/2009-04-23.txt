Exhibit 99.1
Federated Investors, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2009 Earnings
 
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, Pa., April 23, 2009)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.34 for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 compared to $0.54 for the same quarter last year. Net income was $35.1 million for Q1 2009 compared to $55.8 million for Q1 2008. During Q1 2009, Federated recorded non-cash impairment charges of $20.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share mainly related to intangible assets associated with certain acquisitions. Federated also recorded $1.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share in additional non-cash share-based compensation expense.
Federated's total managed assets reached a record $409.2 billion at March 31, 2009, up $70.7 billion or 21 percent from $338.5 billion at March 31, 2008 and up $1.9 billion from $407.3 billion reported at Dec. 31, 2008. Asset growth for the quarter was driven by strong net sales of fixed-income products and continued flows into money market funds. Average managed assets for Q1 2009 were $411.7 billion, up $89.7 billion or 28 percent from $322.0 billion reported for Q1 2008 and up $41.9 billion or 11 percent from $369.8 billion reported for Q4 2008.
"As investors increasingly sought fixed-income products, Federated's broad menu of high-quality bond funds experienced substantial growth in the first quarter," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer. "Federated sold $3.2 billion in fixed-income mutual funds during the quarter, netting $1.1 billion in bond assets, marking Federated's best quarter for net fixed-income sales in more than five years."
Federated's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The dividend is payable on May 15, 2009 to shareholders of record as of May 8, 2009. During Q1 2009, Federated purchased 69,937 shares of Federated class B common stock for $1.1 million.
Money market assets in both funds and separate accounts were $360.1 billion at March 31, 2009, up $82.6 billion or 30 percent from $277.5 billion at March 31, 2008 and up $4.4 billion or 1 percent from $355.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2008. Money market mutual fund assets were $328.8 billion at March 31, 2009, up $86.5 billion or 36 percent from $242.3 billion at March 31, 2008 and up $1.5 billion from $327.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2008.
Federated's fixed-income assets were $25.0 billion at March 31, 2009, up $2.7 billion or 12 percent from $22.3 billion at March 31, 2008 and up $1.5 billion or 6 percent from $23.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2008. Federated had strong net inflows of $1.1 billion into its bond funds during Q1 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
Federated's equity assets were $23.4 billion at March 31, 2009, down $14.1 billion or 38 percent from $37.5 billion at March 31, 2008 and down $3.3 billion or 12 percent from $26.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2008 primarily due to market conditions and, to a lesser extent, net outflows.
Financial Summary
Q1 2009 vs. Q1 2008
For Q1 2009, revenue increased to $310.6 million compared to $305.7 million for the same quarter last year. Increases in revenue of $59.9 million from higher average money market managed assets and $7.7 million from higher average equity and fixed-income managed assets due to the Q4 2008 Prudent Bear and Clover Capital acquisitions were partially offset by a $49.0 million decrease from lower remaining average equity managed assets and $9.7 million in fee waivers recorded in Q1 2009 on certain money market funds in order to maintain zero to positive net yields. These fee waivers were offset by a related reduction in marketing and distribution expenses of $4.6 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $5.1 million. There was also a $2.7 million decrease related to the impact of leap year on Q1 2008 as compared to Q1 2009.
Fee waivers to produce positive or zero net yields may increase and such increases could be significant. The specific level of these waivers will be determined by a variety of factors including market yield levels for money market investments, asset levels within money market funds, changes in the mix of money market assets by type of fund, changes in the expense levels of money market funds and the willingness of the fund adviser to sustain these waivers.
For Q1 2009, Federated derived 71 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 19 percent from equity assets, 9 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for Q1 2009 increased $35.9 million or 17 percent to $250.6 million compared to $214.7 million for Q1 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to a $16.0 million impairment charge related primarily to significant Q1 2009 market declines in the level of managed assets underlying certain customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with two acquisitions. Marketing and distribution expenses increased by $14.7 million primarily from higher average money market managed assets partially offset by lower equity assets and the aforementioned reduction associated with maintaining zero to positive net yields. In Q1 2009, there was also a $3.7 million fixed asset impairment charge reflected in the line item other and a $1.5 million adjustment to share-based compensation expense reflected in compensation and related.
Nonoperating expenses for Q1 2009 increased $2.2 million compared to Q1 2008 primarily due to a $1.4 million decrease in investment income due to lower average investment balances and yields, a $1.0 million increase in recourse debt expense and a $0.4 million impairment charge in Q1 2009 on seed investments in new products.
Q1 2009 vs. Q4 2008
Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased by $8.9 million or 3 percent. Increases in revenue of $24.0 million from higher average money market managed assets and $5.4 million from higher average equity and
 
 
fixed-income managed assets due to the Q4 2008 Prudent Bear and Clover Capital acquisitions were partially offset by an $8.5 million decrease from lower remaining average equity managed assets. In addition, there was an increase of $6.3 million in fee waivers on certain money market funds in order to maintain zero to positive net yields. The increase in fee waivers was offset by a related increase to the reduction in marketing and distribution expenses of $2.7 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $3.6 million. There was also a $6.9 million decrease due to two fewer days in Q1 2009 as compared to Q4 2008.
Compared to Q4 2008, operating expenses increased by $34.6 million or 16 percent. The increase in operating expenses was attributable to four significant items: first, a $16.0 million impairment charge related primarily to significant Q1 2009 market declines in the level of managed assets underlying certain customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with two acquisitions; second, a $10.0 million increase in compensation and related expenses primarily related to a $5.1 million increase to amounts accrued for incentive compensation plans including those related to the recent Prudent Bear and Clover Capital acquisitions, a $2.3 million increase in payroll tax and employee benefit expenses primarily due to Q1 seasonality and a $2.0 million increase in share-based compensation primarily related to a $1.5 million adjustment recorded in Q1 2009; third, a $6.8 million increase in marketing and distribution expenses primarily from higher average money market managed assets partially offset by the aforementioned increased reduction associated with maintaining zero to positive net yields and the impact of two fewer days in Q1 2009 as compared to Q4 2008; and finally, a $3.7 million fixed asset impairment charge reflected in other.
Nonoperating expenses decreased $1.3 million compared to the prior quarter due mainly to a $0.9 million reduction in investment losses, a component of which was a $0.4 million impairment charge in Q1 2009 on seed investments in new products and a $0.4 million decrease in recourse debt expense.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
