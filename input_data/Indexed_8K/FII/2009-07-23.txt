Exhibit 99.1
 
Federated Investors, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2009 Earnings
 
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, Pa., July 23, 2009)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (EPS) of $0.52 for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 compared to $0.54 for the same quarter last year. Income from continuing operations was $53.3 million for Q2 2009 compared to $55.2 million for Q2 2008.
Federated reported YTD 2009 EPS of $0.86 compared to $1.08 for the same period in 2008. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, income from continuing operations was $88.4 million compared to $111.0 million for the same period in 2008.
Federated's total managed assets were $401.8 billion at June 30, 2009, up $68.3 billion or 20 percent from $333.5 billion at June 30, 2008 and down $7.4 billion or 2 percent from $409.2 billion reported at March 31, 2009. Average managed assets for Q2 2009 were $414.4 billion, up $71.1 billion or 21 percent from $343.3 billion reported for Q2 2008 and up $2.7 billion from $411.7 billion reported for Q1 2009.
"Investor confidence in Federated's diverse line of equity and bond products drove strong mutual fund sales in the second quarter," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer. "Federated's fixed-income fund net sales surged to $2.6 billion in the quarter, while Federated's equity fund flows were positive for the quarter."
Federated's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The dividend is payable on August 14, 2009 to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2009. During Q2 2009, Federated purchased 238,400 shares of Federated class B common stock for $5.8 million.
Federated's fixed-income assets were $28.7 billion at June 30, 2009, up $5.7 billion or 25 percent from $23.0 billion at June 30, 2008 and up $3.7 billion or 15 percent from $25.0 billion at March 31, 2009. Federated had strong net inflows of $2.6 billion into its bond funds during Q2 2009 compared to $1.1 billion in Q1 2009. Net sales were driven by strong flows into ultrashort bond funds and intermediate-term bond funds including Federated Total Return Bond Fund and Federated Total Return Government Bond Fund.
Federated's equity assets were $26.2 billion at June 30, 2009, down $11.1 billion or 30 percent from $37.3 billion at June 30, 2008 and up $2.8 billion or 12 percent from $23.4 billion at March 31, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, Federated's net flows into equity funds turned positive with $26 million in net sales. Flows were driven by sales in Federated Market Opportunity Fund and Federated Prudent Bear Fund, both of which invest in alternative-asset classes, and Federated Strategic Value Fund, a dividend-focused fund.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Money market assets in both funds and separate accounts were $346.4 billion at June 30, 2009, up $75.3 billion or 28 percent from $271.1 billion at June 30, 2008 and down $13.7 billion or 4 percent from $360.1 billion at March 31, 2009. Money market mutual fund assets were $312.8 billion at June 30, 2009, up $72.2 billion or 30 percent from $240.6 billion at June 30, 2008 and down $16.0 billion or 5 percent from $328.8 billion at March 31, 2009.
Financial Summary
Q2 2009 vs. Q2 2008
For Q2 2009, revenue was $306.9 million compared to $310.3 million for the same quarter last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects decreases in revenue of $41.2 million from lower average equity managed assets excluding the assets acquired from Clover Capital and Prudent Bear in Q4 2008 and $17.0 million in fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields. These decreases in revenue were partially offset by increases of $43.5 million from higher average money market managed assets, $7.4 million from higher average equity and fixed-income managed assets due to the Q4 2008 Clover Capital and Prudent Bear acquisitions and $2.3 million from higher remaining average fixed-income managed assets. The aforementioned fee waivers were offset by a related reduction in marketing and distribution expenses of $11.4 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $5.6 million.
Fee waivers to produce positive or zero net yields may increase and such increases could be significant. The amount of these waivers will be determined by a variety of factors including available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, changes in assets within money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in expenses of the money market funds and the willingness of the fund adviser to continue these waivers.
For Q2 2009, Federated derived 69 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 20 percent from equity assets and 11 percent from fixed-income assets.
Operating expenses for Q2 2009 remained relatively flat as compared to Q2 2008. Operating expenses for Q2 2009 reflect a $4.6 million increase in compensation and related expenses primarily due to increased headcount related to the recent Clover Capital and Prudent Bear acquisitions. Marketing and distribution expenses increased $3.7 million as compared to Q2 2008 due to higher money market managed assets partially offset by the aforementioned reduction associated with maintaining positive or zero net yields and lower average equity managed assets. In addition, Q2 2009 operating expenses included a decrease in amortization of deferred sales commissions of $3.8 million primarily due to lower average B-share assets.
Q2 2009 vs. Q1 2009
Compared to the prior quarter, revenue decreased by $3.7 million or 1 percent. Decreases in revenue of $8.3 million primarily from lower average money market fund assets were partially offset by a $3.3 million increase from higher average fixed-income managed assets and a $2.1 million increase from higher average equity managed assets. In addition, revenue decreased by $7.3 million from higher fee waivers on certain money market
 
 
 
funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields. This increase in fee waivers was offset by a related decrease in marketing and distribution expenses of $6.8 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $0.5 million. The increase in fee waivers was partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in fee waivers for other competitive reasons as well as an increase in revenue of $3.7 million due to one extra day in Q2 2009 as compared to Q1 2009.
Compared to Q1 2009, operating expenses decreased by $31.8 million or 13 percent. Changes from the prior period include a $19.8 million decrease in expenses due to the non-cash impairment charges recorded in Q1 2009 and an $8.2 million decrease in marketing and distribution expenses primarily from the aforementioned increased reductions associated with maintaining positive or zero net yields. In addition, compensation and related expenses decreased by $2.6 million primarily due to the $1.5 million non-cash share-based compensation expense adjustment recorded in Q1 2009.
Nonoperating expenses decreased $1.7 million compared to the prior quarter due mainly to higher investment income.
YTD 2009 vs. YTD 2008
Revenue for the first half of 2009 increased slightly to $617.5 million compared to $616.0 million for the same period last year. Increases in revenue of $103.4 million from higher average money market managed assets and $15.1 million from higher average equity and fixed-income managed assets due to the Q4 2008 Clover Capital and Prudent Bear acquisitions were partially offset by a $90.2 million decrease from lower remaining average equity managed assets. In addition, there was $26.6 million in fee waivers on certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields. These fee waivers were offset by a related reduction in marketing and distribution expenses of $15.9 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $10.7 million.
For YTD 2009, Federated derived 70 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 20 percent from equity assets and 10 percent from fixed-income assets.
Operating expenses for the first half of 2009 increased by $35.6 million or 8 percent. The increase was attributable to the $19.8 million in non-cash impairment charges recorded in Q1 2009, an $18.4 million increase in marketing and distribution expense primarily from higher average money market managed assets partially offset by the aforementioned reduction associated with maintaining positive or zero net yields and lower average equity managed assets and a $9.4 million increase in compensation and related expense primarily related to the Clover Capital and Prudent Bear acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred sales commissions of $8.3 million primarily due to lower average B-share assets.
Nonoperating expenses for the first six months of 2009 increased $2.4 million compared to the first six months of 2008 primarily due to an increase in recourse debt expense.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can
 
 
 
impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
