For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2009, income from continuing operations was $145.4 million compared to $167.2 million for the same period in 2008. Earnings for YTD 2009 included $20.8 million in non-cash impairment charges recognized primarily in Q1 2009.
Federated's total managed assets were $392.3 billion at Sept. 30, 2009, up $48.3 billion or 14 percent from $344.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2008 and down $9.5 billion or 2 percent from $401.8 billion reported at June 30, 2009.

"Federated's fluctuating fund sales have increased more than 50 percent from the same time last year," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer. "Investors continue to recognize Federated's reputation for managing a broad line of stock, bond and alternative strategies that can help them meet their investing needs."
Federated's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The dividend is payable on Nov. 13, 2009 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 9, 2009. During Q3 2009, Federated purchased 470,581 shares of Federated class B common stock for $12.0 million.

Financial Summary
Q3 2009 vs. Q3 2008
For Q3 2009, revenue decreased by $12.3 million or 4 percent from the same quarter last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects $36.5 million in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields. The fee waivers were partially offset by a related reduction in marketing and distribution expenses of $27.9 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $8.6 million. Lower average equity managed assets also contributed to decreased revenue. These decreases were partially offset by increased revenue from higher average money market and fixed-income managed assets.
Fee waivers to produce positive or zero net yields may increase and such increases could be significant. The amount of these waivers will be determined by a variety of factors including available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, changes in assets within money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in expenses of the money market funds and Federated's willingness to continue these waivers.
For Q3 2009, Federated derived 63 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 24 percent from equity assets, 12 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for Q3 2009 were $198.9 million compared to $212.7 million for Q3 2008. Marketing and distribution expenses decreased because of the aforementioned fee-waiver-related reductions, partially offset by the impact of increases in average money market managed assets.
Q3 2009 vs. Q2 2009
Compared to the prior quarter, revenue decreased by $13.3 million or 4 percent. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects a $19.6 million increase in voluntary fee waivers on certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields. The fee waivers were offset by a related decrease in marketing and distribution expenses of $16.5 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $3.1 million compared to the prior quarter. In addition, revenue decreased due to lower average money market managed assets. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of increased average equity and fixed-income managed assets.
Compared to Q2 2009, operating expenses decreased by $20.0 million or 9 percent. Changes from the prior period include a decrease in marketing and distribution expenses primarily related to the aforementioned fee-waiver-related reductions.
 
YTD 2009 vs. YTD 2008
Revenue for the first nine months of 2009 decreased by $10.8 million or 1 percent compared to the same period last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects voluntary fee waivers of $63.1 million on certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields. The fee waivers were partially offset by a related reduction in marketing and distribution expenses of $43.8 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $19.3 million. In addition, revenue decreased due to lower average equity managed assets. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of increased average money market and fixed-income managed assets.
For YTD 2009, Federated derived 67 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 21 percent from equity assets, 11 percent from fixed-income assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2009 increased by $21.8 million or 3 percent compared to the same period of last year primarily due to $20.8 million in non-cash impairment charges recorded primarily in Q1 2009.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
