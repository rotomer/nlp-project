(PITTSBURGH, Pa., January 28, 2010)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.51 for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2009 compared to $0.53 for the same quarter last year. Net income was $51.9 million for Q4 2009 compared to $54.3 million for Q4 2008.
For the year ended Dec. 31, 2009, Federated reported EPS from continuing operations of $1.92 compared to $2.15 for 2008, a decrease of 11 percent. For 2009, income from continuing operations was $197.3 million compared to $221.5 million for the same period in 2008. Earnings for 2009 included $21.3 million in non-cash impairment charges recognized primarily in Q1 2009.
Federated's total managed assets were $389.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2009, down $18.0 billion or 4 percent from $407.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2008 and down $3.0 billion or 1 percent from $392.3 billion reported at Sept. 30, 2009. Average managed assets for Q4 2009 were $388.1 billion, up $18.3 billion or 5 percent from $369.8 billion reported for Q4 2008 and down $20.0 billion or 5 percent from $408.1 billion reported for Q3 2009.
"With better market conditions in 2009, Federated experienced strong demand for fixed-income and equity products," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer. "Gross sales of fixed-income and equity funds increased 64 percent from 2008. In particular, fixed-income fund sales were strong as investors valued our consistent fund performance over a multi-year period."
Federated's board of directors declared a dividend of $1.50 per share. The dividend, which will be paid in cash, is considered an ordinary dividend for tax purposes and consists of a $0.24 quarterly dividend and a $1.26 special dividend. The dividend is payable on Feb. 12, 2010 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 5, 2010.
"The February 2010 special dividend rewards shareholders for the success that Federated achieved in 2009, " said Thomas R. Donahue, chief financial officer. "Through our diversified business mix and the efforts of our outstanding employees, Federated has successfully navigated through the challenges of the last several quarters and remains well positioned for new growth opportunities."
In addition, during Q4 2009, Federated purchased 50,000 shares of Federated class B common stock for $1.3 million. In 2009, the company purchased 828,918 shares of Federated class B common stock for $20.1 million.

continued strong net positive flows into its bond funds with $1.3 billion during Q4 2009, bringing total net bond fund inflows to $6.8 billion for 2009, an increase of $5.4 billion over 2008. Net sales were driven by strong flows into ultrashort bond funds and intermediate-term bond funds including Federated Total Return Bond Fund.
Federated's equity assets were $29.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2009, up $3.0 billion or 11 percent from $26.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2008 and up $0.6 billion or 2 percent from $29.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2009.

Financial Summary
Q4 2009 vs. Q4 2008
For Q4 2009, revenue decreased by $37.0 million or 12 percent from the same quarter last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects a $54.1 million increase in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields. This increase in fee waivers was largely offset by a related decrease in marketing and distribution expenses of $40.7 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $13.4 million. In addition, revenue decreased due to lower average money market managed assets. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of increased average fixed-income and equity managed assets.
Fee waivers to produce positive or zero net yields may increase and such increases could be significant. The amount of these waivers will be determined by a variety of factors including available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, changes in assets within money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in expenses of the money market funds and Federated's willingness to continue these waivers.
In Q4 2009, Federated derived 56 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 43 percent from fluctuating assets (28 percent from equity assets and 15 percent from fixed-income assets) and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for Q4 2009 were $178.4 million compared to $216.0 million for Q4 2008. This change was primarily a result of lower marketing and distribution expenses due to the aforementioned fee-waiver-related reductions.
Q4 2009 vs. Q3 2009
Compared to the prior quarter, revenue decreased by $28.8 million or 10 percent. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects a $21.0 million increase in voluntary fee waivers on certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields. This increase in fee waivers was largely offset by a related decrease in
 
 
marketing and distribution expenses of $14.7 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $6.3 million compared to the prior quarter. In addition, revenue decreased due to lower average money market managed assets. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of increased average equity and fixed-income managed assets.
Compared to Q3 2009, operating expenses decreased by $20.4 million or 10 percent. Changes from the prior period include a decrease in marketing and distribution expenses primarily related to the aforementioned fee-waiver-related reductions.
2009 vs. 2008
Revenue for 2009 decreased by $47.7 million or 4 percent compared to last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects a $117.0 million increase in voluntary fee waivers on certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields. This increase in fee waivers was largely offset by a related decrease in marketing and distribution expenses of $84.5 million such that the net impact on operating income was a decrease of $32.5 million. In addition, revenue decreased due to lower average equity managed assets. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of increased average money market and fixed-income managed assets.
In 2009, Federated derived 65 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 35 percent from fluctuating assets (23 percent from equity assets and 12 percent from fixed-income assets).
Operating expenses for 2009 decreased by $15.8 million or 2 percent compared to last year. Changes from the prior year include a decrease in marketing and distribution expenses primarily related to the aforementioned fee-waivers offset by the impact of average asset changes, higher acquisition-related compensation expense and non-cash impairment charges to write down certain intangible assets in Q1 2009. Compared to 2008, professional service fees, travel and related and advertising and promotional expenses all decreased during 2009 due, in part, to companywide cost-saving initiatives.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
