Exhibit 99.1
Federated Investors, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2010 Earnings
 
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, Pa., Oct. 28, 2010)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.42 for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2010 compared to $0.56 for the same quarter last year. Net income was $43.1 million for Q3 2010 compared to $57.0 million for Q3 2009.
Federated reported YTD 2010 EPS of $1.27 compared to $1.42 for the same period in 2009. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2010, net income was $132.7 million compared to $145.4 million for the same period in 2009.
Federated's total managed assets were $341.3 billion at Sept. 30, 2010, down $51.0 billion or 13 percent from $392.3 billion at Sept. 30, 2009 and up $4.5 billion or 1 percent from $336.8 billion reported at June 30, 2010. Average managed assets for Q3 2010 were $338.6 billion, down $69.5 billion or 17 percent from $408.1 billion reported for Q3 2009 and up $1.5 billion from $337.1 billion reported for Q2 2010. As the equity and fixed-income markets contracted in 2007 and 2008, Federated's money market assets increased by $182 billion and as markets recovered in 2009 and 2010, Federated's assets reflected industry trends as $95 billion flowed out of Federated's money market products. Since the end of 2006, Federated's money market managed assets have increased $87.3 billion to $260.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2010.
"As investor interest in equities began to increase, Federated saw strong flows into our Strategic Value Dividend Fund and Prudent Bear Fund, both of which are well suited to clients who want a long-term hedge against market uncertainty," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer. "Federated's diversified product mix also benefited investors seeking portfolio balance, as our flagship fixed-income offering, Total Return Bond Fund, continued to see strong flowsand, in fact, has shown positive net flows for the last 19 quarters."
Federated's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The dividend is payable on Nov. 15, 2010 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 8, 2010. During Q3 2010, Federated purchased 147,849 shares of Federated class B common stock for $2.7 million.
Federated's fixed-income assets were $40.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2010, up $8.2 billion or 26 percent from $32.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2009 and up $2.2 billion or 6 percent from $38.0 billion at June 30, 2010. Federated experienced continued positive flows into its bond funds during the quarter, bringing total net YTD bond fund inflows to nearly $2.4 billion. Net sales were driven by strong flows into Federated Total Return Bond Fund, a multi-sector product, flows into several short-duration funds and Federated Institutional High Yield Bond Fund.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Federated's equity assets were $29.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2010, the same as equity assets on Sept. 30, 2009 and up $2.3 billion or 9 percent from $26.8 billion at June 30, 2010. Net sales were led by Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund, Federated Prudent Bear Fund, Federated Max-Cap Index Fund, Federated Clover Small Value Fund and Federated Kaufmann Large Cap Fund.
Money market assets in both funds and separate accounts were $260.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2010, down $57.2 billion or 18 percent from $318.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2009 and up $0.4 billion from $260.5 billion at June 30, 2010. Money market mutual fund assets were $233.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2010, down $54.0 billion or 19 percent from $287.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2009 and up $2.4 billion or 1 percent from $231.2 billion at June 30, 2010. Assets at Sept. 30, 2010 included $11.0 billion transitioned from SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s products late in the quarter. Federated expects an additional $3.5 billion to transition from SunTrust products into Federated money market funds before year-end.
Financial Summary
Q3 2010 vs. Q3 2009
For Q3 2010, revenue decreased by $51.4 million or 18 percent from the same quarter last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects a decrease of $42.9 million resulting from lower average money market managed assets. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of increased average fixed-income and equity managed assets. As detailed at the end of this financial summary, voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields increased during Q3 2010 compared to Q3 2009.
In Q3 2010, Federated derived 51 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 48 percent from fluctuating assets (30 percent from equity assets and 18 percent from fixed-income assets) and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for Q3 2010 were $167.1 million compared to $198.9 million for Q3 2009. This decrease was primarily a result of lower distribution expenses due to the aforementioned fee-waiver-related reductions and lower average money market managed assets.
Q3 2010 vs. Q2 2010
Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased by $10.7 million or 5 percent. As detailed at the end of this financial summary, voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields decreased during Q3 2010 compared to Q2 2010. In addition, revenue increased due to one additional day in Q3 2010 compared to Q2 2010 and an increase in average fixed-income and money market fund managed assets.
Operating expenses for Q3 2010 increased by $19.5 million or 13 percent compared to Q2 2010, primarily due to the Q2 2010 recognition of insurance proceeds that reduced operating expenses by $25.0 million, partially offset by a noncash impairment charge of $7.0 million during Q2 2010 related to intangible and fixed assets associated with a prior-year acquisition.
 
 
 
YTD 2010 vs. YTD 2009
Revenue for the first nine months of 2010 decreased by $204.5 million or 22 percent compared to the same period last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects a $149.8 million decrease resulting from lower average money market managed assets. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of increased average fixed-income and equity managed assets. As detailed at the end of this financial summary, voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields increased for YTD 2010 compared to YTD 2009.
For YTD 2010, Federated derived 50 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 49 percent from fluctuating assets (31 percent from equity assets and 18 percent from fixed-income assets) and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for YTD 2010 decreased by $192.4 million or 29 percent compared to the same period last year. The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in distribution expenses largely related to the aforementioned fee waivers and lower average money market managed assets. The decrease in operating expenses was also attributable to the recognition of insurance proceeds in Q2 2010. In addition, intangible asset impairment and amortization decreased $12.2 million due primarily to the decrease in the impairment charges recorded for certain intangible assets in the first nine months of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
Nonoperating expense increased $5.6 million for YTD 2010 compared to YTD 2009 primarily due to an increase in recourse debt expense associated with the company's term loan, which was amended and restated in Q2 2010 to $425 million.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Fee waivers to produce positive or zero net yields could vary significantly based on market conditions. The amount of these waivers will be determined by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, changes in assets within money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in expenses of the money market funds and Federated's willingness to continue these waivers.
