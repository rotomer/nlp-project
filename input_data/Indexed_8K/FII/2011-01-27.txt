Exhibit 99.1
Federated Investors, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2010 Earnings
 
 
 
(PITTSBURGH, Pa., Jan. 27, 2011)  Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today reported earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.45 for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2010 compared to $0.42 for the prior quarter and $0.51 for the same quarter last year. Net income was $46.4 million for Q4 2010 compared to $43.1 million for the prior quarter and $51.9 million for Q4 2009. During Q4 2010, Federated recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share after tax related to intangible assets associated with a prior-year acquisition.
For the year ended Dec. 31, 2010, Federated reported EPS of $1.73 compared to $1.92 for 2009. For 2010, net income was $179.1 million compared to $197.3 million for 2009.
Federated's total managed assets were $358.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2010, up $16.9 billion or 5 percent from $341.3 billion reported at Sept. 30, 2010 and down $31.1 billion or 8 percent from $389.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2009. Average managed assets for Q4 2010 were $345.7 billion, up $7.1 billion or 2 percent from $338.6 billion reported for Q3 2010 and down $42.4 billion or 11 percent from $388.1 billion reported for Q4 2009.
Through challenging equity and fixed income markets in 2007 and 2008, Federated's money market assets increased by $182 billion. As markets recovered in 2009 and 2010, Federated's money market products experienced $80 billion in net outflows, reflecting industry-wide trends. At the same time, Federated acquired $17 billion in assets from other money-market providers. Federated's money market assets have increased a total of $102.4 billion since the end of 2006 to $276.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2010.
"In the last year, the strategic balance of Federated's diverse product line again benefited our clients and shareholders," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer. "In addition to bond asset growth, strong interest in the Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund contributed to Federated's equity asset increase during the year as investors moved to classic dividend-paying stocks as a source of income."
Federated's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The dividend is payable on Feb. 15, 2011 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 8, 2011. Over the last three years, Federated has paid $703 million or $6.87 per share in dividends reflecting the company's success and profitability over challenging and changing market conditions. During Q4 2010, Federated purchased 222,226 shares of Federated class B common stock for $5.0 million. In 2010, the company purchased 659,675 shares of Federated class B common stock for $14.2 million.
 
 
 
 
Federated's fixed-income assets were $40.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2010, up $6.9 billion or 20 percent from $33.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2009 and up $0.5 billion from $40.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2010. During 2010, Federated's fixed-income separate account assets increased by 63 percent to $8.8 billion. Fixed-income assets in liquidation portfolios were $10.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2010. Net bond fund sales for the quarter were driven by strong flows into Federated Total Return Bond Fund, a multi-sector product; flows into several short-duration funds; and flows into Federated Institutional High Yield Bond Fund and Federated Strategic Income Fund.
Federated's equity assets were $30.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2010, up $1.1 billion or 4 percent from $29.7 billion on Dec. 31, 2009 and up $1.7 billion or 6 percent from $29.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2010. Net sales for the quarter were led by Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund, Federated Max-Cap Index Fund, Federated Kaufmann Large Cap Fund, Federated Clover Small Value Fund and Federated International Strategic Value Dividend Fund.
Money market assets in both funds and separate accounts were $276.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2010, down $37.3 billion or 12 percent from $313.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2009 and up $15.1 billion or 6 percent from $260.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2010. Money market mutual fund assets were $244.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2010, down $36.8 billion or 13 percent from $281.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2009 and up $11.2 billion or 5 percent from $233.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2010. Assets at Dec. 31, 2010 included $14.1 billion acquired from SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s products during Q3 and Q4 2010.
Financial Summary
Q4 2010 vs. Q4 2009
For Q4 2010, revenue decreased by $19.5 million or 7 percent from the same quarter last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects a decrease resulting from lower average money market assets. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of increased average fixed-income and equity assets. As detailed at the end of this financial summary, voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields increased during Q4 2010 compared to Q4 2009.
In Q4 2010, Federated derived 50 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 49 percent from fluctuating assets (31 percent from equity assets and 18 percent from fixed-income assets) and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for Q4 2010 were $166.3 million compared to $178.4 million for Q4 2009. This decrease of $12.1 million was primarily a result of lower distribution expenses due to lower average money market assets and higher fee-waiver-related reductions.
Q4 2010 vs. Q3 2010
Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased by $3.1 million or 1 percent. The increase in revenue reflects higher average equity, money market and fixed-income assets. Voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields increased during Q4 2010 compared to Q3 2010 (see table).
 
 
Operating expenses for Q4 2010 decreased by $0.8 million compared to Q3 2010.
2010 vs. 2009
Revenue for 2010 decreased by $224.1 million or 19 percent compared to the prior year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflects a decrease resulting from lower average money market assets. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of increased average fixed-income and equity assets. Voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order to maintain positive or zero net yields increased for 2010 compared to 2009 (see table).
In 2010, Federated derived 50 percent of its revenue from money market assets, 49 percent from fluctuating assets (31 percent from equity assets and 18 percent from fixed-income assets) and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for 2010 decreased by $204.5 million or 24 percent compared to last year. The decrease primarily reflects lower distribution expenses from the aforementioned fee waivers and lower average money market assets. Also contributing to the decrease in operating expenses was the recognition of insurance proceeds in Q2 2010.
Nonoperating expenses increased $6.3 million for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in recourse debt expense associated with the company's term loan, which was amended and restated in Q2 2010. This increase was partially offset by higher investment income.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Fee waivers to produce positive or zero net yields could vary significantly based on market conditions. The amount of these waivers will be determined by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, changes in assets within money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in expenses of the money market funds and Federated's willingness to continue these waivers.
