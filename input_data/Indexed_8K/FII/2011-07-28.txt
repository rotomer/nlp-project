Financial Summary
Q2 2011 vs. Q2 2010
For Q2 2011, revenue decreased by $5.7 million or 2 percent from the same quarter last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflected an increase in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order for those funds to maintain positive or zero net yields during Q2 2011 compared to Q2 2010. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from higher average money market, equity and fixed-income assets. See additional information about voluntary fee waivers in the table at the end of this financial summary.
In Q2 2011, Federated derived 54 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed income assets (34 percent from equity assets and 20 percent from fixed-income assets), 45 percent from money market assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for Q2 2011 were $153.7 million compared to $147.6 million for Q2 2010. This increase of $6.1 million was primarily a result of higher professional service fees as a result of Federated's recognition of insurance proceeds in Q2 2010, which reduced operating expenses by $25 million. This increase was partially offset by decreases in intangible asset related expense primarily as a result of a Q2 2010 non-cash impairment charge related to a prior-year acquisition and in distribution expense related primarily to increased fee waivers as mentioned above.
Q2 2011 vs. Q1 2011
Compared to the prior quarter, revenue decreased by $13.1 million or 5 percent. The decrease in revenue primarily related to the aforementioned increase in fee waivers and lower average money market assets. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue related primarily to an additional day in Q2 2011 compared to Q1 2011 and to higher average fixed-income and equity assets.
Operating expenses for Q2 2011 decreased by $28.7 million compared to Q1 2011 primarily as a result of lower professional service fees related to Q1 2011 nonrecurring legal expenses and lower distribution expense related primarily to the aforementioned increase in fee waivers.
YTD 2011 vs. YTD 2010
Revenue for the first half of 2011 increased slightly compared to the same period last year. The increase in revenue primarily related to higher average fixed-income and equity assets. This increase was largely offset by the aforementioned increase in fee waivers.
For the first half of 2011, Federated derived 52 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed income assets (33 percent from equity assets and 19 percent from fixed-income assets), 47 percent from money market assets, and 1 percent from other products and services.
 
 
 
Operating expenses for YTD 2011 increased by $27.3 million or 9 percent compared to the same period last year. The increase primarily reflects an increase in professional service fees for YTD 2011 related to the recognition of insurance proceeds in Q2 2010 and nonrecurring legal expenses incurred in Q1 2011. In addition, intangible asset related expense decreased primarily due to the aforementioned impairment of certain intangible assets in Q2 2010.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Fee waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields could vary significantly based on market conditions. The amount of these waivers will be determined by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, changes in assets within money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and other governmental entities, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in expenses of the money market funds and Federated's willingness to continue these waivers.
