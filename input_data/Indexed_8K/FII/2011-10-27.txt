Financial Summary
Q3 2011
vs.
Q3 2010
For
Q3 2011
, revenue decreased by
$28.1 million
or
12 percent
from the same quarter last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflected an increase in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order for those funds to maintain positive or zero net yields during
Q3 2011
compared to
Q3 2010
. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from increased average assets in all three major asset classes. See additional information about voluntary fee waivers in the table at the end of this financial summary.
In
Q3 2011
, Federated derived 55 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (33 percent from equity assets and 22 percent from fixed-income assets), 44 percent from money market assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for
Q3 2011
were
$147.0 million
compared to
$167.1 million
for
Q3 2010
. This decrease of
$20.1 million
was primarily a result of lower distribution expense due to the aforementioned increase in fee waivers.
Q3 2011
vs.
Q2 2011
Compared to the prior quarter, revenue decreased by
$11.7 million
or
5 percent
. The decrease in revenue primarily related to an increase in the aforementioned fee waivers and lower average equity assets. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue related to one additional day in
Q3 2011
compared to
Q2 2011
.
Operating expenses for
Q3 2011
decreased by
$6.7 million
or
4 percent
compared to
Q2 2011
primarily as a result of lower compensation and related expense and distribution expense due to the aforementioned increase in fee waivers.
YTD 2011
vs.
YTD 2010
Revenue for the first nine months of 2011 decreased
$27.9 million
compared to the same period last year. The decrease in revenue primarily reflected an increase in the aforementioned fee waivers. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from increased average fixed-income and equity assets, as well as money market asset mix.
For
YTD 2011
, Federated derived 53 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed income assets (33 percent from equity assets and 20 percent from fixed-income assets), 46 percent from money market assets, and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for
YTD 2011
increased by
$7.2 million
or
2 percent
compared to the same period last year. The increase primarily reflects an increase in professional service fees for
YTD 2011
related to the recognition of insurance proceeds in Q2 2010 and nonrecurring legal expenses incurred in Q1 2011. This increase was partially offset by lower distribution expenses due to the aforementioned increase in fee waivers.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Fee waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields could vary significantly based on market conditions. The amount of these waivers will be determined by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, changes in assets within money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Department of the
  
Treasury and other governmental entities, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in expenses of the money market funds and Federated's willingness to continue these waivers.
