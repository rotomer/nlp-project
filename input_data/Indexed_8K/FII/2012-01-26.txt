Financial Summary
Q4 2011
vs.
Q4 2010
Revenue decreased by
$28.9 million
or
12 percent
due primarily to an increase in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order for those funds to maintain positive or zero net yields and a decrease in, as well as a change in the mix of, average equity assets. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue from increased average money market and fixed-income assets. See additional information about voluntary fee waivers in the table at the end of this financial summary.
Federated derived 53 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (31 percent from equity assets and 22 percent from fixed-income assets), 46 percent from money market assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses were
$154.5 million
compared to
$166.3 million
. This decrease of $11.8 million was primarily a result of lower distribution expense due to the aforementioned increase in fee waivers.
Q4 2011
vs.
Q3 2011
Revenue increased by
$2.4 million
or
1 percent
primarily related to an increase in money market and fixed-income assets, partially offset by a decrease in revenue related to changes in equity asset mix.
Operating expense increased by
$7.5 million
or
5 percent
. This primarily related to a $4.3 million increase in distribution expense largely due to improved prime money market fund yields and increased assets.
2011
vs.
2010
Revenue decreased
$56.8 million
or 6 percent due primarily to an increase in the aforementioned fee waivers, partially offset by increased assets in all asset categories.
Federated derived 53 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed income assets (33 percent from equity assets and 20 percent from fixed-income assets), 46 percent from money market assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses decreased by
$4.5 million
or
1 percent
. The decrease primarily reflects lower distribution expense due to the aforementioned increase in fee waivers. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in professional service fees for 2011 related to the recognition of insurance proceeds in Q2 2010 and nonrecurring legal expenses in Q1 2011.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
  
Fee waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields could vary significantly based on market conditions. The amount of these waivers will be determined by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, changes in assets within money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and other governmental entities, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, changes in expenses of the money market funds and Federated's willingness to continue these waivers.
