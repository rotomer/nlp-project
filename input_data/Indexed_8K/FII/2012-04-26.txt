Investors' growing demand for income and Federated's broad array of high-quality income-oriented products continued to prove beneficial for our company during the first quarter,'' said J.

Financial Summary
Q1 2012
vs.
Q1 2011
Revenue decreased by
$8.6 million
or
4 percent
due primarily to an increase in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order for those funds to maintain positive or zero net yields and a decrease in revenue due to the change in the mix of average equity assets. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue from higher average money market and fixed-income assets. See additional information about voluntary fee waivers in the table at the end of this financial summary.
Federated derived 53 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (32 percent from equity assets and 21 percent from fixed-income assets), 46 percent from money market assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses were
$159.9 million
compared to
$182.4 million
. This decrease of
$22.5 million
or
12 percent
was primarily a result of lower professional service fees as the company incurred nonrecurring legal expenses in Q1 2011.
Additionally, intangible-asset-related expense decreased due to mark-to-market adjustments of an acquisition-related contingent payment liability in both periods, as well as certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2011.
Q1 2012
vs.
Q4 2011
Revenue increased by
$13.9 million
or
6 percent
primarily related to an increase in total average managed assets and a decrease in the aforementioned fee waivers due mainly to improved money market fund yields partially offset by a decrease in the number of days from the prior quarter.
Operating expenses increased by
$5.4 million
or
3 percent
. The increase was primarily related to an increase in compensation and related expense due primarily to the annual reset of payroll taxes and 401(k) contributions and an increase in distribution expense primarily due to improved money market fund yields. Additionally, intangible-asset-related expense decreased due to a Q1 2012 mark-to-market adjustment of an acquisition-related contingent payment liability.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Fee waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields could vary significantly from managements estimates as they are contingent on a number of variables including, but not limited to, changes in assets within the money market funds, available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and other governmental entities, changes in expenses of the money market funds, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, Federateds willingness to continue the fee waivers and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by third parties.
