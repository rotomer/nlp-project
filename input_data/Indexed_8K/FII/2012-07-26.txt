Financial Summary
Q2 2012
vs.
Q2 2011
Revenue increased by
$6.4 million
or
3 percent
due primarily to a decrease of $9.1 million in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order for those funds to maintain positive or zero net yields and due to an increase in average fixed-income assets. The reduction in fee waivers was primarily the result of improved yields available on securities held by money market funds. The revenue increase was partially offset by a decrease due to a change in the mix of average equity assets. See additional information about voluntary fee waivers in the table at the end of this financial summary.
Federated derived 52 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (31 percent from equity assets and 21 percent from fixed-income assets), 47 percent from money market assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses increased
$9.4 million
or
6 percent
primarily as a result of a $4.5 million increase in distribution expense related primarily to reduced fee waivers and increased compensation and related expense.
Q2 2012
vs.
Q1 2012
Revenue increased by
$1.9 million
or
1 percent
primarily related to a decrease in the aforementioned voluntary fee waivers due mainly to improved yields available on securities held by money market funds. This increase was partially offset by lower average money market assets and a change in the mix of average equity assets.
Operating expenses increased by
$3.2 million
or
2 percent
. This increase was primarily related to an increase in compensation and related expense and intangible asset related expense.
YTD 2012 vs. YTD 2011
Revenue for the first half of 2012 decreased by
$2.2 million
, or less than 1 percent from the first half of 2011. The decrease in revenue was primarily related to an increase in the aforementioned voluntary fee waivers primarily as a result of higher average money market assets along with lower average yields available on securities held by money market funds in the first half of 2012, compared to the first half of 2011, and a change in the mix of average equity assets. This revenue decrease was partially offset by an increase related to higher average fixed-income and money market assets.
For the first half of 2012, Federated derived 52 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (31 percent from equity assets and 21 percent from fixed-income assets), 47 percent from money market assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for the first half of 2012 decreased by
$13.0 million
or
4 percent
compared to the same period last year. The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in professional service fees due to nonrecurring legal expenses incurred in Q1 2011. Additionally, intangible asset related expense decreased due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2011 as well as mark-to-market adjustments of an acquisition-related contingent payment liability in both periods.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Fee waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields could vary significantly in the future as they are contingent on a number of
  
variables including, but not limited to, changes in assets within the money market funds, available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and other governmental entities, changes in expenses of the money market funds, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, Federateds willingness to continue the fee waivers and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by third parties.
