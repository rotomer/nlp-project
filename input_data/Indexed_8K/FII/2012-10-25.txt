"Federated continued to see client demand for our dividend-paying equity portfolios with more than $2.5 billion in net sales in those products in the first nine months of the year," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer. "On the international side, Federated made significant moves to grow our global profile by hiring an executive to lead our new Asia Pacific initiative and expanding our European distribution capabilities through an agreement with Bury Street Capital, a successful European distribution firm based in London."
Federated's board of directors declared a dividend of $1.75 per share. The dividend, which will be paid from Federated's existing cash balance, is considered an ordinary dividend for tax purposes and consists of a $0.24 quarterly dividend and a $1.51 special dividend. The dividend is payable on

T
he special dividend is expected to decrease EPS for Q4 2012 by approximately $0.04 and for full-year 2012 by approximately $0.02 due to the application of the two-class method of calculating EPS. During
Q3 2012
, Federated purchased 152,244 shares of Federated class B common stock for $3.0 million.

Financial Summary
Q3 2012
vs.
Q3 2011
Revenue increased by
$24.4 million
or
11 percent
due primarily to a decrease of $19.4 million in voluntary fee waivers related to certain money market funds in order for these funds to maintain positive or zero net yields. The reduction in fee waivers was primarily the result of improved yields available on securities held by money market funds. In addition, revenue increased due to an increase in average fixed-income and equity assets. See additional information about voluntary fee waivers in the table at the end of this financial summary.
During Q3 2012, Federated derived 52 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (31 percent from equity assets and 21 percent from fixed-income assets), 47 percent from money market assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses increased
$1.4 million
or
1 percent
primarily as a result of an increase in distribution expense related primarily to reduced fee waivers and increased compensation and related expense. These increases were offset by the aforementioned recognition of insurance proceeds recorded as a reduction to professional service fees.
Q3 2012
vs.
Q2 2012
Revenue increased by
$6.3 million
or
3 percent
primarily due to one additional day in the quarter, an increase in average fixed-income and equity assets and a decrease in the aforementioned voluntary fee waivers due mainly to improved yields available on securities held by money market funds.
Operating expenses decreased by
$14.7 million
or
9 percent
primarily related to the aforementioned recognition of insurance proceeds.
YTD 2012 vs. YTD 2011
Revenue for the first nine months of 2012 increased by
$22.2 million
, or
3 percent
compared to the first nine months of 2011. The increase in revenue was primarily related to an increase in average fixed-income assets and decrease in the aforementioned voluntary fee waivers primarily as a result of improved yields available on securities held by money market funds partially offset by higher average money market fund assets. These revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease due to a change in the mix of average equity assets.
  
For the first nine months of 2012, Federated derived 52 percent of its revenue from equity and fixed-income assets (31 percent from equity assets and 21 percent from fixed-income assets), 47 percent from money market assets and 1 percent from other products and services.
Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2012 decreased by
$11.6 million
or
2 percent
compared to the same period last year. The decrease primarily reflects lower professional service fees due to the aforementioned recognition of insurance proceeds and nonrecurring legal expenses incurred in Q1 2011. This decrease was partially offset by increases in distribution and compensation and related expenses.
Federated's level of business activity and financial results are dependent upon many factors including market conditions, investment performance and investor behavior. These factors and others including asset levels, product sales and redemptions, market appreciation or depreciation, revenues, fee waivers and expenses can impact Federated's activity levels and financial results significantly. Risk factors and uncertainties that can influence Federated's financial results are discussed in the company's annual and quarterly reports as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Fee waivers to maintain positive or zero net yields could vary significantly in the future as they are contingent on a number of variables including, but not limited to, changes in assets within the money market funds, available yields on instruments held by the money market funds, actions by the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and other governmental entities, changes in expenses of the money market funds, changes in the mix of money market customer assets, Federateds willingness to continue the fee waivers and changes in the extent to which the impact of the waivers is shared by third parties.
