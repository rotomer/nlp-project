(NYSE:CEY) today reported third quarter 2002 diluted earnings per share of $0.35 on revenue of $254.5 million, operating income of $41.3 million and net income of $24.4 million.

THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Highlights of the 2002 third quarter financial results, excluding the $5.4 million charge, as compared to pro forma 2001, are as follows: - Revenue grew 6.9 percent to $254.5 million. - Operating income of $46.7 million increased 3.7 percent. - Interest expense declined to $1.6 million, driven by low interest rates and debt reductions. - Net income increased by 7.5 percent to $27.9 million. - Diluted earnings per share of $0.40, increased by 8.1 percent. - Total debt outstanding was $166.7 million at September 30, 2002. - 1,978,000 shares of common stock were repurchased at a cost of $41.3 million between September 25 and October 8, increasing total debt outstanding to $195.0 million at October 15, 2002.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 modifies accounting for business combinations, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. As of January 1, 2002, all goodwill amortization ceased. In the third quarter of 2001, Certegy's operating income included $2.3 million of goodwill amortization, or approximately $0.027 per diluted share. For comparative purposes, the pro forma financial results for the third quarter of 2001 include adjustments to reflect this accounting change, as if it had been effective January 1, 2001. Attachment Page 2 of 7 provides detail pro forma financial results for third quarter of 2001. SEGMENT RESULTS Card Services generated revenue of $167.6 million in the third quarter of 2002, an increase of $4.8 million, or 2.9 percent, over the prior year quarter. Excluding nonrecurring revenue of $6.3 million in the company's e-banking operations during the third quarter of 2001, Card Services' revenue increased by 7.1 percent (8.2 percent in local currency), driven by a 12.7 percent increase in merchant processing revenue and a 5.0 percent increase in North American card issuing revenue. International card revenue declined by 2.3 percent (an increase of 3.8 percent in local currency) due to unfavorable currency rates and volatile economic conditions in Brazil. Excluding Latin America, international card revenue increased by 27.3 percent (18.4 percent in local currency). Card Services' operating income of $38.9 million increased $2.0 million, or 5.4 percent, over the prior year quarter. Check Services generated revenue of $86.9 million in the third quarter of 2002, an increase of $11.7 million, or 15.6 percent (14.4 percent in local currency), over the third quarter of 2001. Check volumes increased 11.7 percent over the prior year quarter. The growth in volume and revenue are primarily attributable to new contract signings. Check Services' operating income grew to $12.1 million, or 4.1 percent over third quarter 2001. Operating income growth in the quarter was impacted by check volume mix and investment in the check cashing business. Corporate expense increased $0.8 million to $4.3 million. The corporate office was established during the prior year quarter; thus, corporate expense was lower in that initial period. The $5.4 million charge includes a $5.2 million asset impairment charge and a $0.2 million severance charge. Additional severance and related costs will be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002. BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Certegy added 2.2 million cards globally during the quarter, increasing its North American card base to 22.2 million and its international card base to 24.0 million. The Company continues to gain market share in its traditional check authorization business. Significant customer signings in the third quarter included Price Chopper, Polo Ralph Lauren, Sunglass Hut, Hollywood Entertainment and several leading regional and mid-tier accounts. (CERTEGY LOGO)

CERTEGY INC. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) 1. ADOPTION OF EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 01-14 ("EITF 01-14"): In January 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14 ("EITF 01-14"), "Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for 'Out-of-Pocket' Expenses Incurred," which requires that reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses be reclassified as revenues. Historically, the Company has netted such reimbursements against its costs in the consolidated statements of income. As a result of this required adoption and certain similar reclassifications, revenues reported for the third quarters of 2002 and 2001 have increased by $22.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively, for reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses that include postage, delivery, telecommunication, and other costs. These reclassifications, which have no impact on operating income or net income, increased segment revenues and costs of services as follows (in millions): 2. REVENUES BY PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERING ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS): Reclassifications required by EITF 01-14 increased revenues by product and service offering as follows: 3. REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA (BASED ON LOCATION OF CUSTOMER) ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS): Reclassifications required by EITF 01-14 increased revenues by geographic area as follows: ATTACHMENT PAGE 5 OF 7

INTERCHANGE FEES INCLUDED IN MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES REVENUES AND COSTS OF SERVICES ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS): The Company's Card Services segment includes merchant processing contracts directly with merchants and with merchants' financial institutions. When the Company has a direct relationship with the merchant, revenues collected are primarily based on a discount rate, which considers the cost of interchange fees (processing fees paid to credit card associations). When the merchant relationship is with the financial institution, the Company collects transaction fees plus the interchange fees. In both instances, the Company is responsible for collecting the interchange fees from the merchant after settling with the credit card associations. Interchange fees are recorded as a component of revenues and costs of services. Interchange fees included in revenues and costs of services are as follows: 5.
