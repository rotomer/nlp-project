"We have also taken positive actions to strengthen the quality of our merchant processing portfolio. While this has reduced our overall revenue growth, it has enhanced profitability."

SEGMENT RESULTS
 
Card Services generated revenue of $163.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, an increase of $1.0 million, or 0.6% (3.3% in local currency) over the prior-year quarter, driven by a 7.2% increase in North American card revenue and strong international card revenue growth outside of Latin America.  International card revenue increased 2.2% in local currency, but declined by 11.6% in U.S. dollars due to unfavorable currency rates and volatile political and economic conditions in Brazil.  Excluding Latin America, international revenue increased by % in local currency and % in U.S. dollars.  Merchant processing revenue declined by 4.7%, due to the previously announced deconverison of a large customer and the company's focus on improving the overall quality and profitability of the portfolio.

24.3
 
Card Services' operating income grew by 12.0% over the prior-year quarter.  Excluding the severance and other charge, Card Services' operating income grew by 11.2% (14.0% in local currency) to $40.8 million, as compared to non-GAAP fourth quarter 2001 results.  The increase was driven by productivity gains in the card issuing business and a more favorable merchant processing customer mix and cost structure.
 
Check Services generated revenue of $99.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, an increase of $7.7 million, or 8.4% (6.9% in local currency) over the prior-year quarter.  Revenue from new customer signings in 2002 partially offset weak consumer spending in the quarter.
 
Check Services' operating income decreased by 2.0% to $15.2 million in the quarter.  Excluding severance and other charges, Check Services' operating income increased 0.9% to $15.9 as compared to non-GAAP fourth quarter 2001.  Operating income growth was impacted by lower than expected holiday sales, check volume mix and investment in the check cashing business.  Excluding check cashing operating losses in 2002 and 2001, Check Services' non-GAAP operating income grew
2.9%.
 
Corporate non-GAAP expense increased $1.4 million to $5.3 million.  The corporate expense in the fourth quarter of 2002 includes expenses driven by the conversion of administrative functions which were previously outsourced and by recruiting and relocation costs.
 
 
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
 
During the fourth quarter, domestic card issuing transaction volumes increased by 6.8%, driven primarily by growth in debit card transactions.  Certegy added approximately 0.5 million cards, increasing its international card base to 24.2 million and its global card base to 46.7 million.  For the full year 2002, the number of cards processed globally increased by approximately 5.0 million, or 11.9% over 2001.
 
 
Check guaranty volumes increased % over prior fourth quarter, driven by the continued success of new customer signings throughout 2002.  Incremental annualized revenue from new customer signings in 2002 totaled approximately $60 million.
6.8
 
Also during the quarter, Certegy announced a long-term contract with Suncorp-Metway Ltd. to process Suncorp's new Visa card program, which is scheduled to launch in 2003.  Suncorp is Australia's sixth largest bank and second largest insurance company.   Significant card processing contract renewals include Losango and Pan Americano in Brazil, and Ikano in the United Kingdom.
 
On December 31, 2002, Certegy completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Netzee, Inc., a leading provider of integrated Internet banking and bill payment product and services to community banks and credit unions.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 modifies accounting for business combinations, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.  As of January 1, 2002, all goodwill amortization ceased.  For the full year of 2001, Certegy's operating income included $8.6 million of goodwill amortization, or approximately per diluted share.  For comparative purposes, the non-GAAP results for 2001 include adjustments to reflect this accounting change, as if it had been effective January 1, 2001.

Certegy was established as a separate public company through a tax-free distribution to Equifax Inc. shareholders on July 7, 2001.  For comparative purposes, non-GAAP results for full year 2001 include non-GAAP adjustments to reflect $8.4 million of interest expense and $3.3 million of corporate expenses that would have been incurred had the distribution occurred at the beginning of 2001.
 
Full year 2002 non-GAAP results exclude the $12.2 million charge to cover severance, asset impairment and other charges. 
Attachment Pages 4 and 6 of 9 provide detailed reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results for full year 2002 and 2001.
 
 
 
OUTLOOK
 
When commenting on the company's expectations for 2003, Kennedy stated, "Our outlook for the coming year is based on continued slow economic growth. Projected revenue growth rates also reflect the impact of customer reductions in our Brazilian card operation and merchant processing business.  Certegy's fundamental business model remains strong, and we believe we are well positioned to return to historical revenue growth rates in 2004."
 
Compared to 2002 non-GAAP results:
 
 - 
      Revenue of $1.0 billion is expected to increase 3 to 5%.
 - 
      Operating income of $164.2 million is expected to increase 5 to 7%.
 - 
      Diluted earnings per share of $1.41 is expected to increase to $1.52 to $1.55.
 
The above guidance excludes an anticipated charge of approximately $2.0 to $3.0 million for severance and related costs associated with the downsizing of operations in Brazil during the first quarter of 2003.

1.             Revenues by product and service offering are as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
 
2.             Adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14 ("EITF 01-14"):
 
In January 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14 ("EITF 01-14"), "Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket' Expenses Incurred," which requires that reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses be reclassified as revenues.  Historically, the Company has netted such reimbursements against its costs in the consolidated statements of income.  As a result of this required adoption and certain similar reclassifications, revenues reported for the fourth quarters of 2002 and 2001 have increased by $25.4 million and $21.8 million, respectively, for reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses that include postage, delivery, telecommunications, and other costs.  These reclassifications, which have no impact on operating income or net income, increased segment revenues and costs of services as follows (in millions):
 
 
3.             Revenues by geographic area (based on location of customer) are as follows (in millions):
 
 
4.            Interchange fees included in merchant processing services revenues and costs of services are as follows (in millions):
 
               The Company's Card Services segment includes merchant processing contracts directly with merchants and with merchants' financial institutions.  When the Company has a direct relationship with the merchant, revenues collected are primarily based on a discount rate, which considers the cost of interchange fees (processing fees paid to credit card associations).  When the merchant relationship is with the financial institution, the Company collects transaction fees plus the interchange fees.  In both instances, the Company is responsible for collecting the interchange fees from the merchant after settling with the credit card associations.  Interchange fees are recorded as a component of revenues and costs of services.  Interchange fees included in revenues and costs of services are as follows:
 
5.             Severance and other charges recognized in 2002 by segment (in millions):
 
 
6.             Check volumes in dollars are as follows (in billions):
 
 
7.             Number of cards and accounts processed (end of period) are as follows (in millions):
 
 
8.             Merchant volumes in dollars and number of transactions are as follows:
 
9.             Currency translation increased (decreased) revenues and operating income in 2002 as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
10.          Depreciation and amortization by segment is as follows (in millions):
 
 
In accordance with SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," amortization of goodwill ceased effective January 1, 2002.  The non-GAAP depreciation and amortization amounts presented below exclude goodwill amortization expense as if the standard had been effective on January 1, 2001.
 
 
11.          Capital expenditures and acquisitions are as follows (in millions):
 
 
12.          Further guidance with respect to 2003 is as follows:
 
Our outlook for 2003 assumes no meaningful economic recovery occurs and that consumer spending remains subdued throughout the year.  The 3% to 5% range of revenue growth reflects lowered expectations in merchant processing and in our South American Card operation.  Excluding these two businesses, the underlying growth rate assumption is 10% to 12%.
 
Total Card Services' revenue is forecast to decline 1% to 3%, due to merchant processing and the South American Card operation. Excluding these two businesses, the underlying growth rate assumption for the Card segment is 9% to 11%.  The North American Card growth assumption is 8% to 10%.  Card issuer software revenue should approximate $5 million.
 
Check Services' revenue is forecast to grow 14% to 16%.  Check cashing revenue is expected to approximate $15 million, with a growth rate of 10% to 12% in the remainder of the Check business.
 
Overall margins (compared to 2002 non-GAAP results) are expected to expand 20 to 60 basis points.  Corporate expense is expected to approximate $17 million to $18 million.
 
                Interest expense should approximate $6 million to $7 million, and the effective tax rate should approximate 38.3%.  Capital expenditures are forecast to be $40 million to $45 million with free cash flow of $85 million to $95 million.
