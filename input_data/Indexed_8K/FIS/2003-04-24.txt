ITEM 9.    REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
 
Pursuant to Exchange Act Release 47583, Certegy Inc. ("Certegy") is furnishing the following information and Exhibit pursuant to Items 9 and 12 of Form 8-K.
 
On April 24, 2003, Certegy issued a press release to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
During the first quarter of 2003, Certegy recognized $12.6 million of charges ($7.9 million after-tax, or $0.12 per diluted share) for contract termination, severance and other costs. The press release contains a reconciliation of first quarter 2003 financial results calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP to the results excluding these charges.
 
Management believes that presentation of the first quarter 2003 financial results excluding these charges is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare Certegy's core operating results from ongoing operations from period to period in a more meaningful and consistent manner than relying exclusively on GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
 
The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished solely pursuant to Items 9 and 12 of this Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1

Alpharetta, GA., April 24, 2003
 
"We are pleased with the solid performance of our U.S. card issuing business, where revenue grew by 13.7% over the prior year quarter. Also, consolidated operating income increased a strong 20.9%, excluding charges, driven by transaction growth, new product sales and actions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2002 to improve operating efficiencies," stated Lee Kennedy, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Certegy.
 
FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
The following table summarizes a comparison of the 2003 first quarter financial results to the first quarter 2002 results:
 
 
 
A reconciliation of actual 2003 first quarter financial results to results excluding the pre-tax charges of $12.6 million is included in Item 5 of the supplemental information attached to this press release and in the "Investor Center" section of the Company's website. Highlights of the 2003 first quarter results, excluding charges, as compared to 2002, are as follows:
 
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
Card Services generated revenue of $157.2 million in the first quarter of 2003, unchanged from the 2002 first quarter. In local currency, Card Services' revenue increased 2.0%. Growth of 13.7% (9.1% excluding acquisition) in North American card issuing revenue was largely offset by a 16.8% decline in merchant processing revenue. International card issuing revenue declined 14.1% primarily due to the net effects of currency and the Banco Real deconversion in Brazil at the beginning of March. In local currency, international card issuing revenue declined 4.0%. Card Services' operating income of $20.0 million declined by $4.7 million, or 19.0%, compared to the 2002 first quarter. Excluding $11.5 million of charges, Card Services' operating income increased $6.8 million, or 27.6% over the prior year quarter.
 
Check Services generated revenue of $83.0 million in the first quarter of 2003, an increase of $5.4 million, or 6.9% over the 2002 first quarter. In local currency, Check Services revenue increased 4.9%. Revenue growth was impacted by weak retail sales caused by poor weather conditions in some parts of the country, the war in Iraq and soft consumer spending. Check Services' operating income of $6.0 million declined by $1.4 million, or 18.6%, compared to the 2002 first quarter. Excluding $1.0 million of charges, Check Services' operating income declined by $0.3 million, or 4.6% below the 2002 first quarter.
 
Corporate expense of $5.0 million increased by $0.8 million over the 2002 first quarter due to the timing of certain administrative expenses. Excluding the $0.1 million charge, corporate expense increased by $0.7 million.
 
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
 
During the first quarter of 2003, domestic card issuing transaction volumes increased by 10.6%, driven primarily by 22% growth in debit card transactions. Certegy added 0.7 million cards since year-end 2002, excluding the 1.6 million card Banco Real deconversion in Brazil, ending the quarter with a global card base of 45.8 million cards. During the first quarter, Certegy successfully converted Banco Dominicano del Progreso's American Express card portfolio, which is being serviced by Card Services' North American processing center.
 
 
Check Services entered into a multi-year agreement to provide check cashing services to all Safeway Inc. locations in the United States. Also during the quarter, Certegy announced plans to provide check risk management services to Pep Boys and an agreement to offer full-service check processing to National Processing Inc. merchants. Certegy also announced a multi-year extension of its agreement to provide check warranty services for Bed Bath and Beyond.
 
OUTLOOK
 
Certegy reiterated its diluted earnings per share guidance. The Company expects full year 2003 diluted earnings per share to range from $1.40 to $1.43, including first quarter charges of $0.12 per diluted share. This is unchanged from previous guidance of $1.52 to $1.55, excluding charges, for full year 2003. Certegy also provided second quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share guidance of $0.33 to $0.35. When commenting on the 2003 expectations, Kennedy stated, "Our earnings per share outlook for 2003 remains within the range of $1.52 to $1.55, excluding charges. Strength in our domestic card issuing business, on-going cost efficiencies and a lowered effective tax rate should offset the effects of soft consumer spending, which could affect our check business."
