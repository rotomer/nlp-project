VP - Investor and Public Relations 678-867-8004 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CERTEGY ANNOUNCES PROPOSED DEBT OFFERING AND NEW $200 MILLION CREDIT FACILITY ALPHARETTA, Georgia, September 4, 2003 -- Certegy Inc. (NYSE: CEY) today announced that it intends to issue $200 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 4.75% notes (priced to yield 4.82%) due 2008 in a private placement. Completion of the private placement is expected to occur on September 10, 2003, and is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Certegy intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to pay off the outstanding indebtedness under Certegy's $300 million revolving credit facility, which upon completion of the private placement will be cancelled and replaced with a new $200 million revolving credit facility, and for general corporate purposes. The new $200 million revolving credit facility will have substantially the same terms as the former facility, except there will be no subsidiary guarantees. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the notes. Any offers of the notes will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities law. Therefore, the notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. The statements in this release include forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates, and projections about Certegy and our industry. They are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of Certegy's control, that may cause actual results to differ significantly from what is expressed in those statements.
