On January 28, 2004, Certegy Inc. ("Certegy") issued a press release to announce its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2003 and full year 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The press release presents certain operating income, net income, and earnings per share measures that exclude charges for contract termination and other charges, as well as an after-tax expense related to the cumulative effect of an accounting change in 2003 and asset impairment, severance, litigation settlement and other cost in 2002. The press release reconciles these measures to the most directly comparable operating income, net income, and earnings per share measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
Management believes that presentation of these measures excluding the described charges is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare Certegy's core operating resulting results from ongoing operations from period to period in a more meaningful and consistent manner than relying exclusively on GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
 
The information in this Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished solely pursuant to Item 12 of this Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act of Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
Highlights of the 2003 fourth quarter results (including change in accounting), as compared to the prior year quarter (the 2002 quarter included $2.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of severance charges) are as follows:
 
 
Excluding the $2.9 million charge from the 2002 fourth quarter results and the cumulative effect of accounting change from the 2003 fourth quarter results, operating income increased 2.1%, net income increased 4.8%, and diluted earnings per share increased 8.7%.
 
 
"Our two core businesses performed extremely well in the fourth quarter," said Lee Kennedy, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Certegy Inc. "Check Services delivered 9.5% revenue growth and 16.6% profit growth, which was the strongest quarterly performance in over a year. Our domestic card business continues to achieve strong results, and exceeded our expectations with revenue growth of 10.7% in the fourth quarter and 12.3% for the full year," he added.
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
Card Services generated revenue of $162.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, or 0.4% below the 2002 quarter. Strong revenue growth of 10.7% in the Company's North American card issuing operation was offset by declines in South American card issuing and domestic merchant processing revenue. Card Services operating income of $39.9 million increased $1.0 million, or 2.5%, compared to $38.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The prior year quarter included a $1.9 million charge for severance costs. Excluding this charge, operating income declined 2.2%.
 
Check Services generated revenue of $109.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 9.5% over the 2002 quarter, driven by new customer signings, migration of verification volume to guarantee volume, and modest improvement in retail sales. Check Services operating income of $17.7 million increased by $2.5 million, or 16.6%, compared to $15.2 million in the corresponding 2002 quarter. The prior year quarter included a $0.7 million charge for severance costs. Excluding this charge, operating income increased by 11.4%.
 
Corporate expense of $5.1 million decreased by $0.5 million compared to $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The prior year quarter included a $0.3 million charge for severance and other costs. Excluding the 2002 charge, corporate expense decreased $0.2 million.
 
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
 
Certegy's global card base increased to 46.4 million at year-end. Domestic card issuing transaction volumes increased by 9.2% over the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by 17.6% growth in debit card transactions.
 
The Company also extended its contracts with Card Services for Credit Unions ("CSCU") and the Independent Bankers of America ("ICBA") to 2009 and 2008, respectively. Total financial institutions served exceed 6,000.
 
In December, Certegy announced the signing of a multi-year agreement to provide check guarantee services to Belk, Inc., the largest privately owned department store company in the nation.
 
FULL YEAR FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.40 on revenue of $1.0 billion, operating income of $154.4 million and net income of $92.4 million. These full year 2003 results include other charges of $12.2 million ($7.7 million after-
 
 
tax), or $0.12 per diluted share, of contract termination costs as well as other charges, and a $1.3 million ($0.02 per diluted share) after-tax expense related to the cumulative effect of an accounting change. The 2002 results include $12.2 million ($7.7 million after-tax) or $0.11 per diluted share in asset impairment, severance, litigation settlement and other costs.
 
Highlights for the full year 2003 are as follows:
 
 
Excluding the $12.2 million charges in both years and the cumulative effect of accounting change in 2003, operating income increased 1.5%, net income increased 3.8% and diluted earnings per share of $1.54 increased 9.2%.
 
ACCOUNTING CHANGE
 
Effective December 31, 2003, Certegy adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" ("FIN 46"). The adoption of the new accounting standard resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change expense of $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003, and is expected to reduce future earnings by approximately $0.01 per diluted share per annum. This change is related to the accounting for the synthetic lease on the Company's facility located in St. Petersburg, Florida.
 
OUTLOOK
 
Certegy provided the following earnings guidance for 2004:
 
 
The Company expects to achieve diluted earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.31 in the first quarter of 2004.
 
"We expect revenue and earnings per share growth rates to accelerate as we enter the second quarter of 2004 and progress beyond difficult comparisons driven by our Brazilian card operation. Our 2004 guidance includes higher expenses related to healthcare and other benefits, professional liability insurance, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, and the new synthetic lease accounting requirement," Mr. Kennedy concluded.
