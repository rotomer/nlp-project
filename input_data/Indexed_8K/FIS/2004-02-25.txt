Forward-Looking Statements
The statements in this presentation include forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates, and projections about Certegy and our industry.
They are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of Certegy's control, that may cause actual results to differ significantly from what is expressed in those statements.
Factors that could, either individually or in the aggregate, affect our performance include the following, which are described in greater detail in the section entitled "Certain Factors Affecting Forward-Looking Statements" in our 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 17, 2004, with the SEC: Our reliance on a small number of financial industries for the majority of our revenues; our reliance on key strategic relationships; the necessity to maintain qualifications set by bank card associations in order to continue to provide transaction processing services; potential liability when merchant customers cannot or do not reimburse us for charge-backs resolved in favor of cardholders, or when checks we guarantee are dishonored by the check writer's bank; potential loss of customers from continued consolidation in the financial services and in retail industries; a prolonged and permanent decline in check writing; changes in regulation or industry standards applicable to our businesses or those of our customers; the level of economic growth or other factors affecting demand for our products and services; ability to maintain or improve our competitive positions against current and potential competitors; database security and reliability of our information technology systems; risks associated with investments and operations in foreign countries, including exchange rate fluctuations and local political, social, and economic factors; and those other risks listed in the above-referenced section of our Form 10-K.
