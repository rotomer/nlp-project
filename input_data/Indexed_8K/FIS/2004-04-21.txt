On April 21, 2004, Certegy Inc. ("Certegy") issued a press release to announce its financial results for the first quarter of 2004. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
This press release presents certain operating income, net income, and earnings per share measures that exclude charges for contract termination and other charges. The press release reconciles these measures to the most directly comparable operating income, net income, and earnings per share measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
Management believes that presentation of these measures excluding the described charges is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare Certegy's core operating results from ongoing operations from period to period in a more meaningful and consistent manner than relying exclusively on GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
 
 
The information in the Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished solely pursuant to Item 12 of this Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Alpharetta, GA, April 21, 2004  Certegy Inc. (NYSE:CEY) today reported first quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share of $0.32 on revenue of $263.4 million and operating income of $35.5 million.
 
FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
Highlights of the 2004 first quarter results, as compared to the prior year quarter (the 2003 quarter included $12.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, of contract termination, severance and other charges) are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
On a non-GAAP basis (which excludes the $12.6 million charge from the 2003 first quarter results) first quarter 2004 operating income increased 5.8%, net income increased 2.7%, and diluted earnings per share increased 6.7%.
 
"We are very pleased with our first quarter results," stated Lee Kennedy, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Certegy Inc. "We are particularly encouraged by the performance of Check Services, which achieved double-digit revenue and profit growth. Our North American card business also generated strong, consistent results."
 
 
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
Card Services generated revenue of $162.7 million in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 3.5% above the 2003 quarter. Strong revenue growth of 10.8% in the Company's North American card issuing operation resulted from growth in transactions, new sales of e-banking services and card loyalty programs, and one month of revenue from the acquisition of Crittson Financial LLC ("Crittson"). Merchant processing revenue increased by 7.4%, driven by strong retail sales and one month of revenue from the acquisition of Crittson. International card issuing revenue declined 17.8%, caused primarily by the deconversion of Banco Real in the prior year first quarter. Card Services operating income of $32.4 million increased $12.4 million compared to $20.0 million in the first quarter of 2003. The prior year quarter included an $11.5 million charge for contract termination and severance costs. Excluding this charge, operating income increased 3.0%.
 
Check Services generated revenue of $100.7 million in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 21.3% over the 2003 quarter. The strong revenue growth was driven by higher retail sales, new customer signings and continued migration of verification volume to guarantee volume. These results also include one month of revenue from the acquisition of Game Financial Corporation. Check Services operating income of $8.8 million increased by $2.8 million, compared to $6.0 million in the corresponding 2003 quarter. The prior year quarter included a $1.0 million charge for contract termination and severance costs. Excluding this charge, operating income increased by 25.3%.
 
Corporate expense of $5.6 million increased by $0.6 million compared to $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2003.
 
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
 
Certegy's global card base was 46.8 million at quarter-end. A 16.4% increase in debit transactions contributed to overall domestic card transaction growth of 9.6%. Recent new customer announcements include agreements to provide credit card processing services to American Airlines Credit Union and e-banking and electronic bill payment services to Travis Credit Union.
 
Check guarantee volumes increased 12.7% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by strong retail sales. New check customer signings include DSW Shoe Warehouse and the Sharper Image.
 
The Company completed two strategic acquisitions in early March. The acquisition of Crittson Financial LLC further strengthens Certegy's U.S. market share as the leading third party credit card processor for community banks and credit unions. The acquisition of Game Financial Corporation positions Certegy as a leading provider of comprehensive cash access services in the fast-growing gaming industry, and broadens the Company's check risk management product line and customer base.
 
 
OUTLOOK
 
Certegy revised its full year 2004 guidance as follows, to reflect its acquisitions and stronger than expected financial results in the first quarter:
 
 
 
 
The Company expects to achieve diluted earnings per share of $0.37 to $0.38 in the second quarter of 2004, with revenue growth in the mid-teens, as compared with the prior year second quarter.
