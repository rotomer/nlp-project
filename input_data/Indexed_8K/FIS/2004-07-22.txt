ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On July 22, 2004, Certegy Inc. ("Certegy") issued a press release to announce its financial results for the second quarter of 2004. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
This press release presents an operating income measure that excludes charges for contract termination, severance and other charges. The press release reconciles this measure to the most directly comparable operating income measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
Management believes that presentation of this measure excluding the described charges is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare Certegy's core operating results from ongoing operations from period to period in a more meaningful and consistent manner than relying exclusively on GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures however should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
 
The information in the Report, including the Exhibit attached hereto, is furnished solely pursuant to Item 12 of this Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 Certegy Inc. (NYSE:CEY) today reported second quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share of $0.39 on revenue of $284.1 million and operating income of $42.7 million.
Alpharetta, GA, July 22, 2004
 
SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
Highlights of the 2004 second quarter results as compared to the prior year quarter are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"We are very pleased with the positive trends that underlie our second quarter results," stated Lee Kennedy, chairman and chief executive officer of Certegy Inc. "We continue to be encouraged by the performance of the Check Services segment, which achieved 27.2% revenue growth and 35.5% operating income growth. Card Services also generated strong revenue growth of 8.2% and operating income growth of 13.2%. These results were driven by 9.9% revenue growth in North American card issuing and 11.5% revenue growth in merchant processing. We are also very pleased with the margin expansion in both Card and Check Services."
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
Card Services generated revenue of $173.4 million in the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 8.2% above the 2003 quarter. Strong revenue growth of 9.9% in the Company's North American card issuing operation resulted from growth in transactions, new sales of e-banking services and card loyalty programs, and revenue from the acquisition of Crittson Financial LLC, which closed in the first quarter. Merchant processing revenue increased 11.5%, driven by strong retail sales and revenue from the acquisition of Crittson. International card issuing revenue declined 0.4%, caused primarily by the purging of inactive cards by certain customers and prior year pricing adjustments in the Brazilian marketplace. Card Services operating income of $36.1 million increased 13.2%, compared to $31.9 million in the second quarter of 2003. Card Services operating margin of 20.8% increased 90 basis points, compared to 19.9% in the second quarter of 2003.
 
Check Services generated revenue of $110.7 million in the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 27.2% above the 2003 quarter. The strong revenue growth was primarily driven by higher retail sales, new customer signings, and the acquisition of Game Financial Corporation, which closed in the first quarter. Check Services operating income of $12.2 million increased 35.5%, compared to $9.0 million in the second quarter of 2003. Check Services operating margin of 11.0% increased 70 basis points, compared to 10.3% in the second quarter of 2003.
 
Corporate expense of $5.6 million increased by $2.1 million compared to $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2003. The increase in Corporate expense resulted primarily from higher employee-related expenses, including benefit and relocation costs. The prior year second quarter Corporate expense included a $0.4 million benefit related to the market value recovery of the Company's collateral assignment in employee life insurance policies.
 
Interest expense of $3.2 million increased by $1.5 million compared to the second quarter of 2003. Higher interest rates on the Company's borrowings caused by the September 2003 issuance of 4.75% fixed rate notes, higher average outstanding borrowings in the current year second quarter and the impact of FIN 46 lease accounting, effective December 31, 2003, generated the increased interest expense.
 
OUTLOOK
 
Certegy's full year 2004 financial guidance is as follows:
 
 
 
 
The Company expects to achieve diluted earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.46 in the third quarter of 2004, with revenue growth of 14% to 16%, as compared with the prior year third quarter.
