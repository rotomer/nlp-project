FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
Highlights of the 2004 fourth quarter results from continuing operations, as compared to the prior year quarter (before cumulative effect of accounting change in the 2003 quarter) are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certegy previously reported that its Board of Directors had approved a plan to dispose of the Company's merchant acquiring business. Diluted earnings per share from the discontinued operations was $0.03 and $0.02 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2004 fourth quarter included a $0.5 million after-tax benefit from no amortization expense on long-lived assets held for sale as part of discontinued operations, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."
 
"We achieved solid fourth quarter revenue and operating income growth across the company," stated Lee Kennedy, Certegy's chairman and chief executive officer. "Card Services revenue increased 12.7%, driven by strong growth in our North American and international card issuing businesses. We are also pleased with the performance of Check Services, where operating income grew 38.7% over prior year and the margin increased by 350 basis points to 19.7%, representing the highest quarterly margin in the past decade."
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
Card Services generated revenue of $157.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of 12.7% above the 2003 quarter. Revenue growth of 13.1% in the company's North American card operation resulted from new customer signings, growth in e-banking and card loyalty programs, and revenue from the acquisition of Crittson Financial, which closed in the first quarter. International card issuing revenue increased by 16.1%, primarily due to growth from existing customers and the third quarter 2004 acquisition of Caribbean CariCard Services. Merchant processing revenue increased 12.2% over the 2003 quarter. Card Services operating income of $39.9 million increased 5.1%, compared to $37.9 in the fourth quarter of 2003, and the operating margin was 25.3%, compared to 27.2% in the fourth quarter of 2003. The reduction in fourth quarter Card Services margin was due to lower software profits, higher international development costs and changes in mix of revenue.
 
Check Services generated revenue of $124.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of 14.1% over the 2003 quarter, driven by growth in the Company's domestic and international customer base and growth in cash access services, including the first quarter 2004 acquisition of Game Financial Corporation. Check Services operating income of $24.6 million increased 38.7% compared to $17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Check Services operating margin increased by 350 basis points to 19.7%, compared to 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2003. Certegy's front-end proprietary risk modeling technology, improved collections and increased margins in cash access services drove higher profitability in the check segment.
 
Corporate expense of $5.6 million increased by $0.5 million over the prior year quarter. The increase is largely attributable to higher audit fees related to Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404. Interest expense of $3.5 million increased by $0.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. Higher average outstanding revolving credit borrowings and the impact of FIN 46 lease accounting, effective December 31, 2003, generated the increase in interest expense. Other income of $0.6 million declined by $0.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
FULL YEAR FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.75. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.66 with revenue of $1.0 billion, operating income of $179.7 million and income from continuing operations of $105.9 million. Full year 2004 net income includes income from discontinued operations of $5.9 million after-tax, or $0.09 per diluted share. The following is a comparative summary of full year diluted earnings per share:
 
 
Highlights for the full year 2004 results from continuing operations, as compared to the full year 2003 (before the 2003 cumulative effect of accounting change) are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ACCOUNTING CHANGE
 
Certegy expects to adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," in the first quarter of 2005 using the retrospective transition method, which requires restatement of prior periods presented. The following summarizes the restatement of 2004 results that will occur upon adoption of FASB No. 123(R):

Certegy expects the accounting required by FASB 123(R) to reduce 2005 diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09 and will result in an effective tax rate of 37.5% for 2005.
 
2005 GUIDANCE
