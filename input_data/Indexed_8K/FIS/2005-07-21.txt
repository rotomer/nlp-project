FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
St. Petersburg, FL, July 21, 2005  Certegy Inc. (NYSE:CEY) today reported second quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share of $0.75, including an after-tax gain of $27.3 million on the sale of its merchant acquiring business and a $6.8 million after-tax write-down of its remaining merchant acquiring portfolio held for sale to estimated net realizable value, as summarized below:
 
 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.40, a 21.2% increase compared to $0.33 in the second quarter of 2004. Revenue of $276.0 million increased 8.0%, and operating income of $43.4 million increased 15.8% over the prior year quarter.
 
SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
Summarized highlights of the 2005 second quarter results from continuing operations, as compared to the second quarter of 2004, are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Strong revenue and earnings momentum in Card Services, e-Payments and Cash Access, along with another quarter of significant margin expansion in Check Services, drove solid second quarter results," stated Lee A. Kennedy, chairman and chief executive officer of Certegy. "While Check Services revenue growth was weaker than expected, we remain confident that strong new customer signings and new product initiatives will generate increased revenue growth in the second half of the year."
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
Card Services generated revenue of $164.1 million in the second quarter of 2005, an increase of 13.2% above the 2004 quarter. Revenue growth of 10.0% in the Company's North American card operation was driven by growth in institution merchant processing, e-payments (e-banking and electronic bill payment), card transactions, new customer signings and increased adoption of card loyalty programs. International card revenue increased 30.6%, primarily due to new customer signings, growth within existing customers, higher software maintenance and support, the prior year CariCard acquisition and favorable currency rates versus the 2004 quarter. Card Services operating income of $35.3 million increased 8.2%, compared to $32.6 million in the second quarter of 2004. Card Services operating margin of 21.5% in the second quarter of 2005 decreased by 100 basis points compared to an operating margin of 22.5% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to product mix and business development costs.
 
Check Services generated revenue of $111.9 million in the second quarter of 2005, an increase of 1.1% over the 2004 quarter. New customer additions, strong growth in cash access services and favorable currency rates were partially offset by lower check guarantee volumes. Check Services operating income of $16.2 million increased 39.7% compared to $11.6 million in the second quarter of 2004. Check Services operating margin of 14.5% in the second quarter of 2005 increased by 400 basis points compared to an operating margin of 10.5% in the prior year quarter. Certegy's proprietary risk modeling technology, improved collections and increased margins in cash access services drove the significantly improved profitability in the check segment.
 
Corporate expense of $8.1 million increased by $1.4 million over the prior year quarter. The increase is largely attributable to higher audit related fees and business development costs. Interest expense of $3.3 million was comparable to the prior year quarter. Other income of $576,000 increased by $491,000, driven by higher cash balances and interest rates.
 
SALE OF MERCHANT ACQUIRING BUSINESS
 
In June 2005, Certegy completed the sale of a majority of its merchant acquiring business. The Company realized an after-tax gain of $27.3 million ($0.43 per diluted share) on the sale. Also during the quarter, the Company recorded a $6.8 million after-tax write-down ($0.11 per diluted share) of its remaining merchant acquiring portfolio to estimated net realizable value. The Company expects to complete the sale of the remaining portfolio in the third quarter of 2005.
 
OUTLOOK
 
Management provided its earnings outlook for the full year 2005 as follows. This guidance is based on the Company's continuing operations only, and excludes results from the discontinued merchant acquiring business:
 
 
 
 
 
The Company expects to achieve revenue growth of approximately 9% in the third quarter of 2005, driven by low double-digit growth in Card Services and mid single-digit growth in Check Services. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2005 is expected to be $0.46 to $0.47.
