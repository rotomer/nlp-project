FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
St. Petersburg, FL, January 27, 2006  Certegy Inc. (NYSE:CEY) today reported fourth quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share of $0.57, including direct merger and acquisition costs of $2.9 million. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 15.1% to $0.61. Consolidated revenue increased 5.0% to $295.9 million.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2005, the company incurred legal, accounting and other direct costs of $1.649 million related to its pending merger with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and $1.211 million related to the possible formation and acquisition of a majority ownership in a card and merchant processing joint venture in Brazil, which is currently under exclusive negotiation with two leading Brazilian banks. The ultimate tax treatment of these costs cannot be determined with adequate certainty; therefore, no tax benefit has been recorded. Fourth quarter 2005 results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") are reconciled with non-GAAP results excluding these merger and acquisition (M&A) costs, as follows:
 
 
 
FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
Summarized highlights of the 2005 fourth quarter results, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2004, are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"We are pleased with the overall margin expansion and strong growth in earnings per share. All of our businesses are on solid ground going into 2006, and we remain very encouraged with our continued progress in developing new customer relationships and expanding our product offerings. We are especially pleased to announce a seven-year extension of our card processing agreement with the National Australia Bank," stated Lee A. Kennedy, chairman and chief executive officer of Certegy. "Looking to the future, we are extremely excited about the opportunity to further leverage our products across the Fidelity National customer base around the globe."
 
SEGMENT RESULTS
 
Card Services generated revenue of $167.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 6.5% above the 2004 quarter. Revenue growth of 4.3% in the Company's North American card operation was the result of strong growth in e-payments (Internet banking and electronic bill payment) and institution merchant processing. The 1.9% increase in North American card issuing revenue is lower than prior 2005 quarterly growth rates due to $6.5 million of card activation fees in the 2004 fourth quarter. North American card transactions increased 4.7%, driven by 7.0% growth in the number of cards processed. Internet banking subscribers increased 17.5% and electronic bill payment users increased 28.1%. Institution merchant processing volumes increased 15.2%, driven by 12.9% growth in transactions and higher average ticket. International card revenue increased 16.3%, primarily due to growth within existing customers in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. The favorable net impact of currency rates was offset by lower revenue in the U.K. caused by the previously announced bankruptcy of a full-service customer.
 
 
Card Services operating income of $41.2 million increased 5.9%, compared to $38.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company incurred $1.2 million of legal, accounting and other direct costs in connection with the on-going exclusive negotiation with two leading Brazilian banks regarding the possible formation and acquisition of a majority ownership in a card and merchant processing joint venture. Excluding these costs from the fourth quarter results, Card Services operating income increased 9.0% to $42.5 million. Card Services operating margin of 24.6% in the fourth quarter of 2005 decreased by 20 basis points compared to an operating margin of 24.8% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the joint venture formation costs described above. Excluding these costs, on a non-GAAP basis, Card Services operating margin was 25.4% in the fourth quarter of 2005, a 60 basis point increase over the prior year quarter.
 
The company also finalized a seven-year extension of its card processing contract with National Australia Bank.
 
Check Services generated revenue of $128.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 3.1% over the 2004 quarter. Strong underlying growth in the company's cash access business was partially offset by the residual effects of the Gulf Coast storms on the company's gaming operation, a previously announced contract termination and unfavorable currency exchange rates.
 
Check Services operating income of $27.2 million increased 12.8% compared to $24.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Check Services operating margin of 21.2% in the fourth quarter of 2005 increased by 180 basis points compared to an operating margin of 19.4% in the prior year quarter. Certegy's proprietary risk modeling technology, improved collection techniques and higher profitability in cash access services drove the margin expansion in Check Services.
 
Corporate expense of $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 included $1.6 million of legal, accounting and other direct costs related to the pending merger with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Excluding these costs from the fourth quarter results, corporate expense of $5.3 million was $1.3 million below the prior year quarter, due largely to lower stock option expense and other compensation costs, and lower Sarbanes-Oxley compliance related costs.
 
Interest expense was $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Other income, which is primarily comprised of interest income, increased to $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates.
 
The effective tax rate of 38.7% in the fourth quarter of 2005 reflects the impact of not recognizing a tax benefit associated with the merger and acquisition costs of $2.9 million incurred during the quarter. Excluding these costs, the effective tax rate was 36.9% on a non-GAAP basis.
