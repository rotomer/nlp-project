Item 4.01 Changes In Registrant's Certifying Accountant
     On February 1, 2006, the registrant (f/k/a Certegy Inc.) consummated a business combination with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Former FIS"), in which Former FIS was merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the registrant. As a result of the merger, the stockholders of Former FIS acquired a majority of the outstanding common stock of the registrant; consequently, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, the merger will be treated as a reverse acquisition of Certegy Inc. by Former FIS. Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") was the independent registered public accounting firm for Certegy Inc., while KPMG LLP ("KPMG") served as the independent registered public accounting firm for Former FIS.
     On March 13, 2006, the Audit Committee of the registrant decided to engage KPMG as the registrant's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006, and chose not to continue the engagement of Ernst & Young after the completion of the audit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.
     Ernst & Young's reports on the registrant's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
     In connection with the audits of the registrant's financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the subsequent interim period through the date of this Form 8-K, there were no disagreements between the registrant and Ernst & Young on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report on the registrant's consolidated financial statements for such years.
     The registrant provided Ernst & Young with this Form 8-K prior to filing it with the Securities and Exchange Commission and has requested Ernst & Young to furnish the registrant with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether Ernst & Young agrees with the above statements. A copy of Ernst & Young's letter is included as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
     During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the subsequent interim period through the date of this Form 8-K, neither the registrant nor anyone acting on its behalf consulted KPMG regarding either (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the registrant's consolidated financial statements or (2) any matter that was (a) either the subject of a disagreement with Ernst & Young on accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young, would have caused Ernst & Young to make reference to the matter in its report, or (b) a reportable event as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
