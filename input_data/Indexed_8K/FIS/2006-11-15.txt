Since the date of the latest balance sheet included, or incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred or undertaken any liabilities or obligations, whether direct or indirect, liquidated or contingent, matured or unmatured, or entered into any transactions, including any acquisition or disposition of any business or asset, which are material to the Company and the Subsidiaries, individually or taken as a whole, except for liabilities, obligations and transactions which are disclosed in the Pricing Disclosure Package. (h) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package, and all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are fully paid and non-assessable and have been duly and validly authorized and issued, in compliance with all applicable state, federal and foreign securities laws and not in violation of or subject to any preemptive or similar right that entitles any person to acquire from the Company or any subsidiary any Common Stock or other security of the Company or any security convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, Common Stock or any other such security (any "Relevant Security"), except for such rights as may have been fully satisfied or waived prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

(i) The Shares to be delivered on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), have been duly and validly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and will not have been issued in violation of or subject to any preemptive or similar right that entitles any person to acquire any Relevant Security from the Company.

Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received notice of any investigation or proceedings which, if decided adversely to the Company or any such Subsidiary, could reasonably be expected to result in, the revocation of, or imposition of a materially burdensome restriction on, any such Consent. (l) This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (m) The compliance by the Company with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated do not, and will not, (i) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement, instrument, franchise, license or permit to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective properties, operations or assets may be bound, (ii) violate or conflict with any provision of the certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws, certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement, partnership agreement or other organizational documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (iii) violate 5
or conflict with any statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, directive, judgment, decree or order of any judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign; except, with respect to items (i) and (iii), as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (n) No Consent of, with or from any judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental agency or body or any third party, foreign or domestic, is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except the registration under the Securities Act of the Shares and such consents as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriter, each of which has been obtained and is in full force and effect. (o) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, there is no judicial, regulatory, arbitral or other legal or governmental proceeding or other litigation or arbitration, domestic or foreign, pending to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or of which any property, operations or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary is the subject which, individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to the Company or any Subsidiary, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; to the Company's knowledge, no such proceeding, litigation or arbitration is threatened or contemplated. (p) The financial statements and pro forma data, including the notes thereto, and the supporting schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position as of the dates indicated and the cash flows and results of operations for the periods specified of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and the other entities for which financial statements are included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus; except as otherwise stated in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, said financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved; and the supporting schedules included in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus present fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be stated therein. No other financial statements or supporting schedules are required to be included in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Rules and Regulations. The other financial and statistical information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus present fairly the information included therein and have been prepared on a basis consistent with that of the financial statements that are included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus and the books and records of the respective entities presented therein. (q) The pro forma financial statements included in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus have been properly compiled and prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations and include all adjustments necessary to present fairly in accordance with 6

(r) The statistical, industry-related and market-related data included in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus are based on or derived from sources which the Company reasonably and in good faith believes are reliable and accurate, and such data agree with the sources from which they are derived. (s) The Common Stock has been registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. The shares of Common Stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), and the Company has taken no action designed to, or likely to have the effect of, terminating the registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act or de-listing the Common Stock from the NYSE, nor has the Company received any notification that the Commission or the NYSE is contemplating terminating such registration or listing. (t) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting and other controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accounting for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

The Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective and the Company is not aware of any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. (v) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act; such disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries is made known to the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer by others within those entities; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective. (w) There is and has been no failure on the part of the Company or any of its directors or officers, in their capacities as such, to comply with any provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley 7
Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated in connection therewith (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), including, without limitation, Section 402 related to loans and Sections 302 and 906 related to certifications except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (x) Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates (within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act) has taken, directly or indirectly, any action which constitutes or is designed to cause or result in, or which could reasonably be expected to constitute, cause or result in, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security to facilitate the sale or resale of the Shares. (y) The statements set forth or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Pricing Disclosure Package and Prospectus under the captions "Summary of the Offering" and "Description of Capital Stock", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Common Stock, and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects. (z) The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and files periodic reports with the Commission, and the conditions for use of Form S-3 to register the Shares under the Securities Act have been satisfied. The documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations and, when read together with the other information in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, as applicable, do not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (aa) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the sale of the Shares as contemplated herein, will not be an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. (bb) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, there are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company and any person that would give rise to a valid claim against the Company or the Underwriter for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or other like payment in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (cc) The Company and each Subsidiary owns or leases all such properties as are necessary to the conduct of its business as presently operated and as proposed to be operated as described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus. The Company and the Subsidiaries have good and marketable title in fee simple to all real property and good and marketable title to all personal property owned by them, in each case free and clear of any and all Liens except such as are described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus or such as do not (individually or in the aggregate) materially 8
affect the value of such property or materially interfere with the use made or proposed to be made of such property by the Company and the Subsidiaries; and any real property and buildings held under lease or sublease by the Company and the Subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases with such exceptions as are not material to, and do not materially interfere with, the use made and proposed to be made of such property and buildings by the Company and the Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice of any claim adverse to its ownership of any real or personal property or of any claim against the continued possession of any real property, whether owned or held under lease or sublease by the Company or any Subsidiary. (dd) The Company and each Subsidiary (i) owns or possesses the right to use all patents, patent applications, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names, trademark registrations, service mark registrations, copyrights, licenses, formulae, customer lists, and know-how and other intellectual property (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures, "Intellectual Property") necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses as presently conducted and as described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus and (ii) have no reason to believe that the conduct of their respective businesses does or will conflict with, and have not received any notice of any claim of conflict with, any such right of others, and, to the Company's knowledge, there is no infringement by third parties of any Intellectual Property, except in each case as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; there is no pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others challenging the Company's or any Subsidiary's rights in or to any such Intellectual Property, and the Company is unaware of any facts which would form a reasonable basis for any such claim; and there is no pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others that the Company or any Subsidiary infringes or otherwise violates any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary rights of others, and the Company is unaware of any other fact which would form a reasonable basis for any such claim. (ee) The Company and the Subsidiaries maintain insurance in such amounts and covering such risks as the Company reasonably considers adequate for the conduct of its business and the value of its properties and as is customary for companies engaged in similar businesses in similar industries, all of which insurance is in full force and effect, except where the failure to maintain such insurance could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no material claims by the Company or any Subsidiary under any such policy or instrument as to which any insurance company is denying liability or defending under a reservation of rights clause. The Company reasonably believes that it will be able to renew its existing insurance as and when such coverage expires or will be able to obtain replacement insurance adequate for the conduct of the business and the value of its properties at a cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. (ff) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary has accurately prepared and timely filed all federal, state, foreign and other tax returns that are required to be filed by it and has paid or made provision for the payment of all taxes, assessments, governmental or other similar charges, including without limitation, all sales and use taxes and all taxes which the Company or any Subsidiary is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to employees, creditors and third parties, with respect to the periods covered by such tax returns (whether or not 9
such amounts are shown as due on any tax return). No deficiency assessment with respect to a proposed adjustment of the Company's or any Subsidiary' federal, state, local or foreign taxes is pending or, to the best of the Company's knowledge, threatened. The accruals and reserves on the books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries in respect of tax liabilities for any taxable period not finally determined are adequate to meet any assessments and related liabilities for any such period and, since December 31, 2005, the Company and the Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability for taxes other than in the ordinary course of its business. There is no tax lien, whether imposed by any federal, state, foreign or other taxing authority, outstanding against the assets, properties or business of the Company or any Subsidiary. (gg) No labor disturbance by the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary exists or, to the best of the Company's knowledge, is imminent, which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (hh) No "prohibited transaction" (as defined in either Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder ("ERISA") or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code")), "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA) or other event of the kind described in Section 4043(b) of ERISA (other than events with respect to which the 30-day notice requirement under Section 4043 of ERISA has been waived) has occurred with respect to any employee benefit plan for which the Company or any Subsidiary would have any liability which could (individually or in the aggregate) reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; each employee benefit plan for which the Company or any Subsidiary would have any liability is in compliance in all material respects with applicable law, including (without limitation) ERISA and the Code; the Company has not incurred and does not expect to incur liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to the termination of, or withdrawal from any "pension plan"; and each plan for which the Company would have any liability that is intended to be qualified under Section 401 (a) of the Code is so qualified and nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which could cause the loss of such qualification. (ii) There has been no storage, generation, transportation, handling, use, treatment, disposal, discharge, emission, contamination, release or other activity involving any kind of hazardous, toxic or other wastes, pollutants, contaminants, petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, chemicals or materials ("Hazardous Substances") by, due to, on behalf of, or caused by the Company or any Subsidiary (or, to the Company's knowledge, any other entity for whose acts or omissions the Company is or may be liable) upon any property now or previously owned, operated, used or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary, or upon any other property, which would be a violation of or give rise to any liability under any applicable law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or permit, common law provision or other legally binding standard relating to pollution or protection of human health and the environment ("Environmental Law"), except for violations and liabilities which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There has been no disposal, discharge, emission contamination or other release of any kind at, onto or from any such property or into the environment surrounding any such property of any Hazardous Substances with respect to which the Company or any Subsidiary has knowledge, except as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse 10
Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has agreed to assume, undertake or provide indemnification for any liability of any other person under any Environmental Law, including any obligation for cleanup or remedial action, except as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no pending or, to the best of the Company's knowledge, threatened administrative, regulatory or judicial action, claim or notice of noncompliance or violation, investigation or proceedings relating to any Environmental Law against the Company or any Subsidiary. No property of the Company or any Subsidiary is subject to any Lien under any Environmental Law. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to any material order, decree, agreement or other individualized legal requirement related to any Environmental Law.

(b) Each Selling Shareholder, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of the Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact relating to such Selling Shareholder contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact relating to such Selling Shareholder required to be stated therein or necessary to make (i) the statements in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, not misleading, or (ii) the statements in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, or the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that such Selling Shareholder will be liable in any such case to the extent but only to the extent that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Selling Shareholder expressly for use therein, it being agreed that the only such information is that which is included under the heading "Selling Shareholders" which relates to such Selling Shareholder; and, provided further, however, that in no such case shall any Selling Shareholder be liable or responsible under this subsection (b) and Section 10 for any amount in excess of the proceeds (net of the underwriting discount but before deducting other expenses) applicable to the Shares sold by such Selling Shareholder pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Selling Shareholder may otherwise have including under this Agreement. 22
(c) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Selling Shareholder, each of the directors of the Company, each of the officers of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever as incurred (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation), joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, as originally filed or any amendment thereof, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriter specifically for use therein; provided, however, that in no case shall the Underwriter be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Shares to be purchased by the Underwriter hereunder. The parties agree that such information provided by or on behalf of the Underwriter consists solely of the material referred to in Section 17 hereof. (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above of notice of any claims or the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify each party against whom indemnification is to be sought in writing of the claim or the commencement thereof (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have under this Section 9 to the extent that it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof or otherwise has notice of any such action, and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability that such indemnifying party may have otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement hereunder). In case any such claim or action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate, at its own expense in the defense of such action, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the written consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by one 23
of the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to have charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, (iii) the indemnifying party does not diligently defend the action after assumption of the defense, or (iv) such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those available to one or ail of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the indemnifying parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened claim, investigation, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought by an indemnified party under this Section 9 or Section 10 hereof (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, investigation, action or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or any failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party. 10. Contribution. In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 9 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable from any indemnifying party or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified thereunder, the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the nature contemplated by such indemnification provision (including any investigation, reasonable slegal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claims asserted, but after deducting in the case of losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses suffered by the Company and any Selling Shareholder, any contribution received by the Company and any Selling Shareholder from persons, other than the Underwriter, who may also be liable for contribution, including persons who control the Company or any Selling Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and directors of the Company) as incurred to which the Company, any Selling Shareholder and one or more of the Underwriter may be subject, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand from the Offering or, if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as are appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one and the Underwriter on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the Offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Shareholders bears to (y) the underwriting discount or commissions received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of each of the Company and the Selling Shareholders on the one hand and of the Underwriter on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other 24
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or a Selling Shareholder on the one hand or the Underwriter on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Shareholders and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, (i) the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the discounts and commissions applicable to the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 10, each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of the Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and any Selling Shareholder, as applicable, subject in each case to clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties, notify each party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 10 or otherwise. The obligations of the Company and the Selling Shareholders to contribute pursuant to this Section 10 are joint and several. 11. Default by Selling Shareholders. (a) If any Selling Shareholder or Selling Shareholders shall default in its or their obligation to sell and deliver any Shares hereunder, then the Underwriter may, by notice to the Company, terminate this Agreement without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting party except that the provisions of Sections 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 13 hereof shall remain in full force and effect. No action taken pursuant to this Section 11 shall relieve any Selling Shareholder so defaulting from liability, if any, in respect of such default. 25
(b) In the event that such default occurs and the Underwriter agrees to proceed with the Offering, then the Underwriter may, at its option, by notice to the Selling Shareholders, postpone the Closing Date, for a period not exceeding five business days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents and arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the opinion of Underwriter's Counsel, may thereby be made necessary or advisable; and in no event shall the Company be obligated to sell Shares hereunder. 12. Survival of Representations and Agreements. All representations and warranties, covenants and agreements of the Underwriter, the Company and the Selling Shareholders contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any Subsidiary or of the Selling Shareholders submitted pursuant hereto, including the agreements contained in Section 5 and 6, the indemnity agreements contained in Section 9 and the contribution agreements contained in Section 10, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter or any controlling person thereof or by or on behalf of the Company or any Selling Shareholder, any of their officers and directors or any controlling person thereof, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares to and by the Underwriter. The representations contained in Section 1 and the agreements contained in Sections 5, 6, 9, and 14 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement, including termination pursuant to Section 11 or 13 hereof. 13. Effective Date of Agreement; Termination. (a) This Agreement shall become effective when the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Agreement. (b) The Underwriter shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing Date if, at or after the Applicable Time, (i) any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted, or in the opinion of the Underwriter will in the immediate future materially disrupt, the market for the Company's securities or securities in general; or (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the NYSE or Nasdaq shall have occurred; or (iii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the NYSE shall have occurred; or (iv) a banking moratorium has been declared by any state or federal authority or any material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services shall have occurred; or (v) any downgrading shall have occurred in the Company's corporate credit rating or the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act) or any such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; or (vi) (A) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or there is a declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States or (B) there shall have been any other calamity or crisis or any change in political, financial or economic conditions if the effect of any such event in (A) or (B), in the judgment of the Underwriter, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale and delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, 26
(c) Any notice of termination pursuant to this Section 13 shall be in writing. (d) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to any of the provisions hereof, or if the sale of the Shares provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriter set forth herein is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof, the Company will, subject to demand by the Underwriter, reimburse the Underwriter for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of its counsel), incurred by the Underwriter in connection herewith. 14.
