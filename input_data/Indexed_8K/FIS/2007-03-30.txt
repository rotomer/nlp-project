Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule of Standard; Transfer of Listing
The Company received notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on March 26, 2007 of its failure to disclose its independent directors by name in its 2006 proxy statement in violation of Section 303A.02(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. After consulting with the NYSE, the Company has elected to cure this deficiency by naming each of its independent directors in this current report.
At a meeting held on February 6, 2007, the Company's board of directors designated the following directors independent under the NYSE's listing standards:
Robert M. Clements Thomas M. Hagerty Marshall Haines Keith W. Hughes David K. Hunt James K. Hunt Daniel D. (Ron) Lane Richard N. Massey Cary H. Thompson
