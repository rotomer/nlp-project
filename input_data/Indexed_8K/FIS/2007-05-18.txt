Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Grants of Stock Options
On May 14, 2007, FNRES Holdings, Inc. ("FNRES"), a minority-owned subsidiary of the Company, granted options to purchase shares of FNRES common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), to the following executive officers of FIS for services to be provided to FNRES in the amounts set forth opposite their names:
The options to purchase shares were granted at an exercise price of $10.00 per share pursuant to the FNRES Holdings, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and have a term of eight years. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Current Report have the meaning given to them under the Plan. The options vest under the following conditions:
The Total Number of Shares Subject to Option shall vest upon the earliest to occur of (i) a Change in Control and (ii) following an Initial Public Offering, in each case, solely if the Equity Value of a share of FNRES Common Stock shall equal at least $20.00 per share (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11 of the Stock Option Agreement) provided the Optionee's Service with FNRES has not terminated prior to the applicable vesting date. If the Equity Value target is not met at the time of a Change in Control, FNRES will use commercially reasonable efforts to have the acquirer or the surviving or continuing company assume or continue, as the case may be, the unvested options on the same (or nearly as practicable) terms and conditions as set forth herein. If the acquirer will not agree to so assume or continue, then such options shall terminate.
For purposes of this calculation, "Equity Value" shall be determined as follows:
(i) in the event of a Change in Control, the Equity Value shall be determined at the time of the transaction constituting a Change in Control, and shall be equal to the aggregate amount of per share net proceeds (other than any taxes) of cash or readily marketable securities and the discounted expected value of any other deferred consideration (as determined by the Board of Directors of FNRES) received or to be received by the holders of Common Stock of FNRES in such transaction (including all shares issuable upon exercise of in-the-money options, whether or not exercisable) at the time of the Change in Control; and
(ii) at any time after an Initial Public Offering, the Equity Value shall be measured using the average price of the Common Stock over a consecutive forty-five (45) day trading period; provided, however, that the full forty-five day trading period must conclude on or prior to the expiration date of the option.
