Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 24, 2007, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. issued an earnings release announcing its financial results for the Second Quarter of 2007. The information included in Items 2.02 and 9.01 within this Current Report are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information included in Items 2.02 and 9.01 within this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
A copy of the earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On July 3, 2007, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. announced the theft of consumer information by one of its former employees. The Company's investigation into this matter has been on-going. To date, after elimination of duplications and invalid data, the Company has determined that approximately 8.5 million consumer records were stolen. Some of these records contained only identifying information (i.e., name, address, telephone number and in some cases, date of birth). However, approximately 5.7 million of the records included checking account records and approximately 1.5 million included credit card records. This is an incremental increase of approximately 3.5 million checking account records and approximately 1.4 million credit card records over our announcement on July 3, 2007. The Company has also determined that a portion of the stolen credit card information was derived from its credit card issuance business. Because the investigation is continuing, it is possible that more records may be identified in the future. The Company continues to see no evidence of the stolen information being used for anything other than marketing purposes. Although the Company does not anticipate significant liability to consumers or for financial fraud, there can be no assurance that this matter will not result in fines or other consequences that adversely impact the Company or its relationship with governing organizations, customers or regulators.

Exhibit 99.1
      Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), a leading global provider of technology services to financial institutions, today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2007. Consolidated revenue increased to $1.2 billion, net earnings increased to $148.0 million and net earnings per diluted share totaled $0.75, which includes a $58.0 million, or $0.29 per share, after-tax gain on the sale of Covansys Corporation common stock.
Jacksonville, Fla.  July 24, 2007
     FIS reported revenue growth of 15.1%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 10.9% and adjusted cash earnings per diluted share of $0.59. "We are very pleased with the outstanding second quarter results and the strong contribution from each of our businesses," stated FIS Executive Chairman William P. Foley, II. "We are also very excited about our pending merger with eFunds, which will strengthen our competitive position adding scale, additional product capability, and broader global reach."
     FIS' operating results are presented on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis and on an adjusted pro forma basis, which management believes provides more meaningful comparisons between the periods presented. FIS' full year 2006 pro forma results reflect a January 1, 2006 effective date for the merger between FIS and Certegy. Additionally, the adjusted pro forma results exclude certain merger and acquisition and integration expenses, certain stock compensation charges, debt restructuring charges, and a gain on the sale of Covansys Corporation common stock. Reconciliations between GAAP and pro forma results are provided in the attachments to this press release, which are posted on the company's website at http://www.fidelityinfoservices.com.
 
     FIS presents its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, in order to provide the investment community with a broader means of evaluating the operating performance of its operations, FIS also reports several non-GAAP measures, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), net earnings plus depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures ("Free Cash Flow") and net earnings plus other tax-adjusted purchase price amortization ("Cash Earnings"). Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results and schedules showing historical detail are provided in the attachments to this press release.
Segment Information
     FIS' Transaction Processing Services generated revenue of $709.7 million, or 16.0% over the prior-year period, driven by 44.3% growth in International, 11.0% growth in Enterprise Solutions and 9.1% growth in Integrated Financial Solutions. Strong new sales, expansion within the existing client base and the Company's item processing operation in Brazil contributed to the strong revenue growth. Transaction Processing Services' EBITDA increased 16.3% over the prior-year quarter to $171.5 million. The EBITDA margin was 24.2%, which was comparable to the 24.1% margin reported for the second quarter of 2006.
     Lender Processing Services' revenue increased 13.3% to $462.5 million, driven by 20.3% growth in Information Services, which continues to benefit from strong results within default solutions, appraisal, and title and settlement services. Lender Processing Services' EBITDA was $149.0 million, or 5.4% above the prior year quarter. The EBITDA margin was 32.2%, compared to 31.5% in the first quarter of 2007, and 34.7% in the second quarter of 2006. The decline from the prior year quarter is primarily the result of significant growth in lower margin appraisal volumes.
 
     Additional segment information is provided in the following table. Certain prior year numbers have been adjusted to reflect subsequent reclassifications between business units:
     Corporate expense for the second quarter of 2007 totaled $21.0 million. The $2.1 million increase compared to the prior year quarter is attributable to a $4.0 million increase in stock option expense. The effective tax rate was 36.9%.
Outlook
     The Company reiterates its full year guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.97 to $2.03, and adjusted cash earnings per diluted share of $2.47 to $2.53. Management expects 2007 pro forma revenue growth of 9% to 11% (compared to previous guidance of 7% to 9%) and adjusted pro forma EBITDA growth to approach the high end of its previously announced guidance of 10% to 12%.
     On June 27, 2007, FIS announced a definitive agreement to acquire EFD/eFunds Corporation in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $1.8 billion. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2007, subject to certain regulatory approvals, approval by EFD shareholders and customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to be neutral to cash earnings per diluted share in
 
2007. Including synergies, the transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted cash earnings per diluted share in 2008.
     FIS will host a call with investors and analysts to discuss second quarter results on Wednesday, July 25, 2007, beginning at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time.
