EXHIBIT 99.1
     The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements present FIS's historical financial statements with adjustments relating to the acquisition of eFunds by FIS, known as the eFunds Acquisition. On September 12, 2007, FIS completed the acquisition of eFunds, in a cash transaction. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, eFunds became a wholly-owned subsidiary of FIS. The following pro forma combined financial statements also combine Certegy's historical statements of continuing operations with those of FIS for the periods that it was not already consolidated by FIS. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2006 are presented as if the eFunds Acquisition and the merger between FIS and Certegy, known as the Certegy Merger, had been completed on January 1, 2006.
The Acquisition of eFunds by FIS
     Under the purchase method of accounting, the aggregate consideration paid for eFunds is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values on the transaction date. FIS established that the fair value of the net assets acquired was lower than the purchase price, and as a result, goodwill was recorded for the amount that the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. The allocation of the purchase price is based on preliminary valuations. The Company is still assessing the values assigned to acquired computer software and customer relationships, as well as various employment agreements, lease agreements, vendor arrangements, and customer contracts of eFunds. Upon completion of the valuations and assumptions, adjustments may be recorded to reflect the finalized valuations.
     In connection with the eFunds Acquisition, the Company adopted eFunds' stock option plans and has registered approximately 2.2 million shares underlying stock options and 0.2 million shares underlying restricted stock units in replacement of similar outstanding awards held by eFunds employees.
The Merger of FIS and Certegy
     U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that one of the two companies in the transaction be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. FIS was designated as the accounting acquirer because immediately after the merger FIS's stockholders held more than 50% of the common stock of the combined company. As a result, the merger of Certegy and FIS was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting. Under this accounting treatment, FIS was considered the acquiring entity and Certegy was considered the acquired entity for financial reporting purposes. The financial statements of the combined company after the merger reflect the financial results of FIS on a historical basis, and include the results of operations of Certegy from the effective date of the merger, February 1, 2006.
     Under the purchase method of accounting, the aggregate consideration paid for Certegy was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values on the transaction date. FIS established that the fair value of the net assets acquired was lower than the purchase price and, as a result, goodwill was recorded for the amount that the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.
     These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with FIS's, eFunds', and Certegy's historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as previously filed. The Company has not provided a pro forma combined balance sheet herein, as the Company's Form 10-Q, filed November 9, 2007, includes a consolidated balance sheet of FIS as of September 30, 2007, reflecting the combination of FIS and eFunds. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations of the combined company that would have been
 
reported had the merger been completed as of the dates presented, and are not necessarily representative of the future consolidated results of operations of the combined company.
     The September 30, 2007 pro forma results include a pre-tax gain of $274.5 million on the sale of FIS's investment in Covansys, and pre-tax merger related costs recorded in September 2007 by eFunds of approximately $91.4 million.
 
     The December 31, 2006 pro forma results include pre-tax merger related costs recorded in January 2006 by Certegy of approximately $79.7 million and a pre-tax charge of $24.5 million related to FIS performance-based stock compensation.

     These combined statements of continuing operations include the historical statements of continuing operations of FIS, eFunds, and Certegy as though the eFunds Acquisition and Certegy Merger had occurred on January 1, 2006, adjusted for items related to the transactions with eFunds and Certegy as described below:
