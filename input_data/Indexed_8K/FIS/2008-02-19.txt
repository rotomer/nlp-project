Exhibit 99.1
      Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), a leading global provider of technology services to financial institutions, today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. Fourth quarter 2007 consolidated revenue increased 20.0% to $1.3 billion, net earnings totaled $108.4 million, and net earnings per diluted share was $0.55.
Jacksonville, Fla.  February 14, 2008
     FIS' fourth quarter 2007 results include approximately $140 million in revenue and approximately $45 million in EBITDA from eFunds. Excluding eFunds, the Company reported fourth quarter revenue growth of 7.4% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 12.5%. FIS' adjusted cash earnings of $0.68 per diluted share increased 17.2% over the prior year period. eFunds was neutral to cash earnings.
     For the full year 2007, consolidated revenue totaled $4.8 billion, net earnings totaled $561.2 million and net earnings per diluted share totaled $2.86. These results include revenue of approximately $167 million and EBITDA of approximately $51 million attributable to eFunds, which was acquired by FIS in September 2007. Excluding eFunds, full year revenue increased 11.0% to $4.6 billion, compared to pro forma revenue of $4.1 billion in 2006. The increase was driven by 10.5% growth in Transaction Processing Services and 11.2% growth in Lender Processing Services. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.0% over 2006 pro forma results.
     "It was a good quarter and great year for FIS," stated William P. Foley, II, executive chairman of FIS. "Double digit revenue growth in Transaction Processing Services and Lender Processing Services enabled us to achieve excellent financial performance in 2007, despite a highly challenging economic environment. We expect to make significant progress with the eFunds integration, and are on track to complete the spin-off of our Lender Processing business by mid 2008."
     FIS' operating results are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and on an adjusted pro forma basis, which management believes provides more meaningful comparisons between the periods presented. FIS' pro forma results reflect a January 1, 2006 effective date for the merger between FIS and Certegy. The adjusted and adjusted pro forma results exclude certain merger and acquisition and integration expenses, certain stock compensation charges, restructuring and other charges, and gains on the sale of Covansys Corporation common stock, Property Insight and other assets.
 
Segment Information
     Transaction Processing Services generated revenue of $875.3 million compared to $694.7 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 26%. EBITDA increased 35.6% to $243.0 million. The EBITDA margin was 27.8% compared to 25.8% in the fourth quarter of 2006.
     Excluding eFunds, TPS revenue increased 5.8% to $735.3 million driven by 21.2% growth in International to $170.8 million and 5.2% growth in Integrated Financial Solutions to $297.9 million. Enterprise Solutions revenue totaled $267.1 million, which is a 2% decrease compared to the prior year quarter. The decline is attributable to significant core banking customer implementations in the second half of 2006 and reduced retail volumes in Check Services in 2007. Excluding eFunds, EBITDA increased 7.6% to $192.8 million. The EBITDA margin increased 40 basis points to 26.2%, driven by improved profitability in Integrated Financial Solutions and International, partially offset by the lower retail volumes within Check Services.
     Lender Processing Services revenue increased 9.5% to $454.8 million, driven by 13.4% growth in Information Services, which continues to benefit from strong results within the default solutions and appraisal product lines, and 8.7% growth in Mortgage Processing revenues, driven by a net increase in non-account based revenues which include termination fees. Lender Processing Services' EBITDA increased to $153.8 million, or 16.2% above the prior year quarter. The EBITDA margin improved to 33.8% versus 31.9% in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by continued margin expansion within Default Services and the aforementioned non-account based revenue.
     Additional segment information is provided in the following table. Certain prior year numbers have been adjusted to reflect subsequent reclassifications between business units.
 
     Corporate expense, as adjusted, for the fourth quarter of 2007 totaled $31.1 million compared to $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to the eFunds acquisition. The effective tax rate was 37.0%.
2008 Outlook
     FIS provided its outlook for 2008 as follows:
 
     The Company's 2008 guidance for corporate expense includes after-tax stock option expense of approximately $33.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. This compares to after-tax stock option expense of $23.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share in 2007. The guidance excludes approximately $25 million in integration expense and approximately $25 million in integration capital associated with the eFunds acquisition. The guidance also excludes up-front costs associated with the spin-off of the Company's Lender Processing Services division and incremental operating expenses for the proposed stand-alone entity.
     In the first quarter of 2008, the Company expects to achieve earnings per diluted share of $0.42 to $0.45 and cash earnings per diluted share of $0.57 to $0.60. This guidance excludes integration expense associated with the eFunds acquisition and up-front costs and incremental operating expenses associated with the spin-off of the Lender Processing Services division.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
     FIS reports several non-GAAP measures, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), net earnings plus depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures ("Free Cash Flow") and net earnings plus tax-adjusted purchase price amortization ("Cash Earnings"). Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures is included in the appendices to this release.
