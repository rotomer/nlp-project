ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS.
     On July 2, 2008 (the "spin-off date"), all of the shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of Lender Processing Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("LPS"), previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "Registrant"), were distributed to the Registrant's shareholders through a stock dividend (the "spin-off"). At the time of the distribution, LPS consisted of all the assets, liabilities, businesses and employees related to the Registrant's lender processing services segment as of the spin-off date. In the spin-off, the Registrant contributed to LPS all of its interest in such assets, liabilities, businesses and employees in exchange for shares of the Common Stock and $1,585 million aggregate principal amount of LPS's debt obligations (the "Debt Obligations"). Upon the distribution, the Registrant's shareholders received one-half share of the Common Stock for every share of the Registrant's common stock held as of the close of business on June 24, 2008. Such shareholders of the Registrant collectively received 100% of the Common Stock of LPS, which is now a stand-alone public company trading under the symbol "LPS" on the New York Stock Exchange. Further details regarding the spin-off may be found in LPS's Registration Statement on Form 10 (File No. 1-34005) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as amended (the "Form 10"), and the information statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 thereto (the "information statement").
     In connection with the spin-off, the following agreements between the Registrant and LPS became effective: Contribution and Distribution Agreement; Tax Disaffiliation Agreement; Employee Matters Agreement; Corporate and Transitional Services Agreement; Reverse Corporate and Transitional Services Agreement; Lease Agreement and Aircraft Interchange Agreement. The Contribution and Distribution Agreement contains the key provisions relating to the separation of the LPS business from the Registrant and the distribution of shares of the Common Stock. The Tax Disaffiliation Agreement sets forth rights and obligations of the Registrant and LPS with respect to federal, state, local, and foreign taxes for tax periods before the spin-off and related matters, certain indemnification rights and obligations with respect to taxes for tax periods before the spin-off and for any taxes and associated adverse consequences resulting from the spin-off and certain restrictions designed to preserve the tax-free status of the spin-off. The terms of these agreements were further described in the information statement and the forms were attached as exhibits to the Form 10.
     A copy of the press release announcing the completion of the spin-off is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
     In connection with the spin-off, the Registrant also entered into the agreements described below.
Exchange Agreement
     The Registrant entered into an Exchange Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. and Wachovia Bank, National Association, (collectively, the "Lenders"), J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC, and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC (collectively, the "Investment Banks") and, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, LPS. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Registrant transferred to the Lenders and the Investment Banks the Debt Obligations in exchange (the "Exchange") for the existing Tranche B Term Loans of the Registrant held by the Lenders and the Investment Banks. A copy of the Exchange Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference into this Item 1.01.
     The Exchange was consummated on July 2, 2008.
ITEM 1.02. TERMINATION OF MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS.
     As described above, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Registrant transferred $1,210,000,000 of the Debt Obligations to the Lenders and $375,000,000 of the Debt Obligations to the Investment Banks in exchange for all of the Registrant's outstanding Tranche B Term Loans. The Tranche B Term Loans were made under the Credit Agreement dated January 18, 2007, as amended, among the Registrant, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. Following the Exchange all such Tranche B Term Loans were retired.

Adjustment to Registrant Stock Option Grants and Restricted Stock Grants
     Effective as of the spin-off, the Registrant stock options held by Lee A. Kennedy and Alan L. Stinson were adjusted, pursuant to the terms of the applicable equity incentive plans of the Registrant, taking into account the change in the value of the Registrant's common stock as a result of the spin-off. The FIS stock options held by William P. Foley, II and Brent B. Bickett were split. Two-thirds of the stock options were adjusted in the same manner as the stock options held by the Registrant's other named executive officers. The remaining one-third was substituted with LPS stock options, with equitable adjustments made to the exercise prices and the number of shares underlying the stock options to reflect the difference in value of the Registrant's and LPS's common stock. Except for these adjustments, the substitute awards have the same terms and conditions, including vesting schedules, as the original awards.
     Effective as of the spin-off, the Registrant restricted stock awards held by Messrs. Kennedy and Stinson were equitably adjusted by increasing the number of shares of the Registrant's restricted stock to prevent dilution. The restricted stock awards held by Messrs. Foley and Bickett were split. Two-thirds of their restricted stock awards were equitably adjusted by increasing the number of shares of the Registrant's restricted stock to prevent dilution. The additional shares of restricted stock have the same transfer restrictions and forfeiture conditions as the original grants. The remaining one-third was substituted with awards of LPS restricted stock. These substitute awards have the same terms and conditions as the original awards, and the shares vest on the same dates the forfeited awards would have vested. The number of shares subject to the awards was adjusted to reflect the differences in the value of the Registrant's and LPS's common stock.
     Effective as of the spin-off, and in connection with their resignations from the Registrant to become President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, respectively, of LPS, the stock options and awards of restricted stock of the Registrant held by Jeffrey S. Carbiener and Eric D. Swenson were cancelled.

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.,
GEORGE SCANLON
     1. . The purpose of this Agreement is to terminate all prior agreements between Company, and any of its affiliates, and Employee relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, to recognize Employee's significant contributions to the overall financial performance and success of Company, to protect Company's business interests through the addition of restrictive covenants, and to provide a single, integrated document which shall provide the basis for Employee's continued employment by Company. In consideration of the execution of this Agreement and the termination of all such prior agreements, the parties each release all rights and claims that they have, had or may have arising under such prior agreements.
Purpose and Release
     2. . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company employs Employee to serve as EVP, Finance. Employee accepts such employment and agrees to undertake and discharge the duties, functions and responsibilities commensurate with the aforesaid position and such other duties and responsibilities as may be prescribed from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") or the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"). Except as expressly provided in Subsection 13(c), Employee shall devote substantially all of his business time, attention and effort to the performance of his duties hereunder and shall not engage in any business, profession or occupation, for compensation or otherwise without the express written consent of the CEO or Board, other than personal, personal investment, charitable, or civic activities or other matters that do not conflict with Employee's duties.
Employment and Duties
     3. . This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless terminated as set forth in Section 8, continue through April 15, 2011. This Agreement shall be extended automatically for successive one (1) year periods (the initial period and any extensions being collectively referred to as the "Employment Term"). Either party may terminate this Agreement as of the end of the then-current period by giving written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of that period. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement or Employee's employment, Sections 8 through 10 shall remain in effect until all obligations and benefits that accrued prior to termination are satisfied.
Term
     4. . During the Employment Term, Company shall pay Employee an annual base salary, before deducting all applicable withholdings, of no less than $415,000.00 per year, payable at the time and in the manner dictated by Company's standard payroll policies. Such minimum annual base salary may be periodically reviewed and increased (but not decreased without Employee's express written consent) at the discretion of the CEO, Board or Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee") to reflect, among other matters, cost of living increases and performance results (such annual base salary, including any increases pursuant to this Section 4, the "Annual Base Salary").
Salary
 
     5. . In addition to any executive bonus, pension, deferred compensation and long-term incentive plans which Company or an affiliate of Company may from time to time make available to Employee, Employee shall be entitled to the following during the Employment Term:

Termination of Employment
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee being placed on a paid leave for up to sixty (60) days pending a determination of whether there is a basis to terminate Employee for Cause shall not constitute Good Reason. Employee's continued employment shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any act or failure to act constituting Good Reason hereunder; provided, however, that no such event described above shall constitute Good Reason unless: (1) Employee gives Notice of Termination to Company specifying the condition or event relied upon for such termination either: (x) within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such event; or (y) in the case of an event predating a Change in Control, within ninety (90) days of the Change in Control; and (2) Company fails to cure the condition or event constituting Good Reason within thirty (30) days following receipt of Employee's Notice of Termination.
     9. .
Obligations of Company Upon Termination
 
 
 
For purposes of this Agreement, no event or transaction that is entered into, is contemplated by, or occurs as a result of the proposed spin-off of the Lender Processing Services division by Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. that was publicly announced on October 25, 2007 shall constitute a Change in Control. In addition, Employee agrees and consents to any conversion or modification of outstanding stock options, restricted stock or other equity-based incentive awards permissible under their corresponding plans (if any) and/or the assignment of this Agreement in connection with that proposed transaction.
10. .
Excise Tax Gross-up Payments
 
 
 
11. . The obligations, rights and benefits of Employee hereunder are personal and may not be delegated, assigned or transferred in any
Non-Delegation of Employee's Rights
 
manner whatsoever, nor are such obligations, rights or benefits subject to involuntary alienation, assignment or transfer.
     12. . Employee acknowledges that he will occupy a position of trust and confidence and will have access to and learn substantial information about Company and its affiliates and their operations that is confidential or not generally known in the industry including, without limitation, information that relates to purchasing, sales, customers, marketing, and the financial positions and financing arrangements of Company and its affiliates. Employee agrees that all such information is proprietary or confidential, or constitutes trade secrets and is the sole property of Company and/or its affiliates, as the case may be. Employee will keep confidential, and will not reproduce, copy or disclose to any other person or firm, any such information or any documents or information relating to Company's or its affiliates' methods, processes, customers, accounts, analyses, systems, charts, programs, procedures, correspondence or records, or any other documents used or owned by Company or any of its affiliates, nor will Employee advise, discuss with or in any way assist any other person, firm or entity in obtaining or learning about any of the items described in this Section 12. Accordingly, Employee agrees that during the Employment Term and at all times thereafter he will not disclose, or permit or encourage anyone else to disclose, any such information, nor will he utilize any such information, either alone or with others, outside the scope of his duties and responsibilities with Company and its affiliates.
Confidential Information
     13. .
Non-Competition
 
     14. . Upon termination of the Employment Term, Employee shall return immediately to Company all records and documents of or pertaining to Company or its affiliates and shall not make or retain any copy or extract of any such record or document, or any other property of Company or its affiliates.
Return of Company Documents
     15. . Any and all improvements or inventions that Employee may make or participate in during the Employment Term, unless wholly unrelated to the business of Company and its affiliates and not produced within the scope of Employee's employment hereunder, shall be the sole and exclusive property of Company. Employee shall, whenever requested by Company, execute and deliver any and all documents that Company deems appropriate in order to apply for and obtain patents or copyrights in improvements or inventions or in order to assign and/or convey to Company the sole and exclusive right, title and interest in and to such improvements, inventions, patents, copyrights or applications.
Improvements and Inventions
     16. . The parties agree and acknowledge that the rights conveyed by this Agreement are of a unique and special nature and that Company will not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of a failure by Employee to abide by its terms and conditions, nor will money damages adequately compensate for such injury. Therefore, it is agreed between and hereby acknowledged by the parties that, in the event of a breach by Employee of any of the obligations of this Agreement, Company shall have the right, among other rights, to damages sustained thereby and to obtain an injunction or decree of specific performance from any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain or compel Employee to perform as agreed herein. Employee hereby acknowledges that obligations under Sections and Subsections 12, 13(b), 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 shall survive the termination of employment and be binding by their terms at all times subsequent to the termination of employment for the periods specified therein. Nothing herein shall in any way limit or exclude any other right granted by law or equity to Company.
Actions
 
     17. . Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Company may require that, prior to payment of any amount or provision of any benefit under Section 9 or payment of any Gross-Up Payment pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement (other than due to Employee's death), Employee shall have executed a complete release of Company and its affiliates and related parties in such form as is reasonably required by Company, and any waiting periods contained in such release shall have expired. With respect to any release required to receive payments owed pursuant to Section 9, Company must provide Employee with the form of release no later than seven (7) days after the Date of Termination and the release must be signed by Employee and returned to Company, unchanged, effective and irrevocable, no later than sixty (60) days after the Date of Termination.
Release
     18. . Company agrees that, if Employee's employment hereunder is terminated during the Employment Term, Employee is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to Employee by Company hereunder. Further, the amount of any payment or benefit provided for hereunder (other than pursuant to Subsection 9(a)(v) hereof) shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Employee as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits or otherwise.
No Mitigation
     19. . This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes and replaces all prior agreements, understandings and commitments with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may be amended only by a written document signed by both parties to this Agreement.
Entire Agreement and Amendment
     20. . This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Florida, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Any litigation pertaining to this Agreement shall be adjudicated in courts located in Duval County, Florida.
Governing Law
     21. . This Agreement may not be assigned by Employee. In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any successor to Company, Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the stock, business and/or assets of Company, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of Company to obtain such assumption by a successor shall be a material breach of this Agreement. Employee agrees and consents to any such assumption by a successor of Company, as well as any assignment of this Agreement by Company for that purpose. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean Company as herein before defined as well as any such successor that expressly assumes this Agreement or otherwise becomes bound by all of its terms and provisions by operation of law.
Successors
     22. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
 
     23. . If any party finds it necessary to employ legal counsel or to bring an action at law or other proceedings against the other party to interpret or enforce any of the terms hereof, the party prevailing in any such action or other proceeding shall be promptly paid by the other party its reasonable legal fees, court costs, litigation expenses, all as determined by the court and not a jury, and such payment shall be made by the non-prevailing party no later than the end of the Employee's tax year following the Employee's tax year in which the payment amount becomes known and payable; provided, however, that on or after a Change in Control, and following Employee's termination of employment with the Company, if any party finds it necessary to employ legal counsel or to bring an action at law or other proceedings against the other party to interpret or enforce any of the terms hereof, Company shall pay (on an ongoing basis) to Employee to the fullest extent permitted by law, all legal fees, court costs and litigation expenses reasonably incurred by Employee or others on his behalf (such amounts collectively referred to as the "Reimbursed Amounts"); provided, further, that Employee shall reimburse Company for the Reimbursed Amounts if it is determined that a majority of Employee's claims or defenses were frivolous or without merit. Requests for payment of Reimbursed Amounts, together with all documents required by the Company to substantiate them, must be submitted to Company no later than ninety (90) days after the expense was incurred. The Reimbursed Amounts shall be paid by Company within ninety (90) days after receiving the request and all substantiating documents requested from Employee. The payment of Reimbursed Amounts during Employee's tax year will not impact the Reimbursed Amounts for any other taxable year. The rights under this Section 23 shall survive the termination of employment and this Agreement until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
Attorneys' Fees
     24. . If any section, subsection or provision hereof is found for any reason whatsoever to be invalid or inoperative, that section, subsection or provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the force and validity of any other provision of this Agreement. If any covenant herein is determined by a court to be overly broad thereby making the covenant unenforceable, the parties agree and it is their desire that such court shall substitute a reasonable judicially enforceable limitation in place of the offensive part of the covenant and that as so modified the covenant shall be as fully enforceable as if set forth herein by the parties themselves in the modified form. The covenants of Employee in this Agreement shall each be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Employee against Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Company of the covenants in this Agreement.
Severability
     25. . Any notice, request, or instruction to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when personally delivered or three (3) days after being sent by United States Certified Mail, postage prepaid, with Return Receipt Requested, to the parties at their respective addresses set forth below:

     To Employee:
George Scanlon Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. 601 Riverside Avenue Jacksonville, FL 32204
     26. . The waiver by any party of any provisions of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach by the other party.
Waiver of Breach
     27. . Company or an affiliate may deduct from all compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement any taxes or withholdings Company is required to deduct pursuant to state, federal or local laws.
Tax Withholding
     28. . To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement and any payment made hereunder shall comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and any related regulations or other guidance promulgated with respect to such Section by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service ("Code Section 409A"). Any provision that would cause the Agreement or any payment hereof to fail to satisfy Code Section 409A shall have no force or effect until amended to comply with Code Section 409A, which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Code Section 409A.

Employee's continued employment shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any act or failure to act constituting Good Reason hereunder; provided, however, that no such event described above shall constitute Good Reason unless: (1) Employee gives Notice of Termination to Company specifying the condition or event relied upon for such termination either: (x) within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such event; or (y) in the case of an event predating a Change in Control, within ninety (90) days of the Change in Control; and (2) Company fails to cure the condition or event constituting Good Reason within thirty (30) days following receipt of Employee's Notice of Termination.

The parties agree and acknowledge that the rights conveyed by this Agreement are of a unique and special nature and that Company will not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of a failure by Employee to abide by its terms and conditions, nor will money damages adequately compensate for such injury.

Employee hereby acknowledges that obligations under Sections and Subsections 12, 13(b), 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 shall survive the termination of employment and be binding by their terms at all times subsequent to the termination of employment for the periods specified therein.

This Agreement may be amended only by a written document signed by both parties to this Agreement.
Entire Agreement and Amendment
     20. . This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Florida, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Any litigation pertaining to this Agreement shall be adjudicated in courts located in Duval County, Florida.
Governing Law
     21. . This Agreement may not be assigned by Employee. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors or assigns.

     24. . If any section, subsection or provision hereof is found for any reason whatsoever to be invalid or inoperative, that section, subsection or provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the force and validity of any other provision of this Agreement. If any covenant herein is determined by a court to be overly broad thereby making
Severability
 
the covenant unenforceable, the parties agree and it is their desire that such court shall substitute a reasonable judicially enforceable limitation in place of the offensive part of the covenant and that as so modified the covenant shall be as fully enforceable as if set forth herein by the parties themselves in the modified form. The covenants of Employee in this Agreement shall each be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Employee against Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Company of the covenants in this Agreement.
     25. . Any notice, request, or instruction to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when personally delivered or three (3) days after being sent by United States Certified Mail, postage prepaid, with Return Receipt Requested, to the parties at their respective addresses set forth below:

     26. . The waiver by any party of any provisions of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach by the other party.
Waiver of Breach
     27. . Company or an affiliate may deduct from all compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement any taxes or withholdings Company is required to deduct pursuant to state, federal or local laws.
Tax Withholding

Any provision that would cause the Agreement or any payment hereof to fail to satisfy Code Section 409A shall have no force or effect until amended to comply with Code Section 409A, which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Code Section 409A.
Code Section 409A

Exhibit 99.2
     The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements present the historical financial statements of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Georgia corporation, ("FIS"), with adjustments relating to our spin-off of 100% of the common stock of Lender Processing Services, Inc., a Delaware Corporation ("LPS"), (the "Spin-off"), which was completed July 2, 2008. These statements also reflect our retirement of $1,585.0 million in debt in connection with the spin-off and related adjustments to interest expense related to the debt retirement, and the related reduction in equity. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2008 is presented as if the Spin-off had been completed on March 31, 2008. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of continuing operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2007 are presented as though the Spin-off had been completed on January 1, 2007. Further, the 2007 pro forma statement of operations includes adjustments for our acquisition of eFunds Corporation ("eFunds"), which was completed on September 12, 2007 (the "eFunds Acquisition") as if it had been completed on January 1, 2007.
     These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes previously filed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2008. The historical statement of continuing operations for FIS for the year ended December 31, 2007 has been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of certain discontinued operations which occurred in the three month period ended March 31, 2008. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position of FIS that would have been reported had the Spin-off and eFunds Acquisition been completed as of the dates presented, and are not necessarily representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial position of our company.
The Spin-off of LPS by FIS and Debt Exchange
     On July 2, 2008, all of the shares of the common stock of LPS were distributed to FIS's shareholders through a stock dividend. At the time of the distribution, LPS consisted of all the assets, liabilities, businesses and employees related to FIS's lender processing services segment as of the spin-off date. Prior to the spin-off, FIS contributed to LPS all of its interest in such assets, liabilities, businesses and employees in exchange for shares of the common stock of LPS and $1,585.0 million aggregate principal amount of LPS's debt obligations (the "Debt Obligations"). Upon the distribution, FIS's shareholders received one-half share of LPS common stock for every share of FIS common stock held as of the close of business on June 24, 2008. LPS is now a stand-alone public company trading under the symbol "LPS" on the New York Stock Exchange.
     Contemporaneously with the Spin-off, we transferred the LPS Debt Obligations to certain lenders under our existing credit facility in exchange for their assignment to us of the entire remaining $1,585.0 million principal amount of our Term Loan B, which we then retired. This loan was incurred in connection with the eFunds acquisition.
The Acquisition of eFunds by FIS
     On September 12, 2007 we completed the eFunds Acquisition for $1,790.8 million, of which $1,744.9 million was cash paid for eFunds' common stock.
     Under the purchase method of accounting, the aggregate consideration paid for eFunds is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values on the transaction date. FIS established that the fair value of the net assets acquired was lower than the purchase price, and as a result, goodwill was recorded for the amount that the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. In connection with the eFunds Acquisition, the Company adopted eFunds' stock option plans and registered approximately 2.2 million shares underlying stock options and
 
     0.2 million shares underlying restricted stock units in replacement of similar outstanding awards held by eFunds employees.
