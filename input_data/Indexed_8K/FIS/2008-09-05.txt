Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 2, 2008, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. ("FIS") completed the spin-off of Lender Processing Services, Inc. ("LPS"). Since the completion of the spin-off occurred subsequent to the reporting period ended June 30, 2008, generally accepted accounting principles do not allow presentation of LPS as a discontinued operation in our periodic filings until FIS presents operating results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2008. Because of these requirements and desire to furnish additional information to investors to improve the understanding of the Company's operating performance, management is separately furnishing information which reflects the operations of LPS as a discontinued operation. The purpose of the schedules included in Exhibit 99.1 is to recast the 2007 results from continuing operations by quarter and on an annual basis, along with the first and second quarter of 2008 in a manner consistent with how FIS will report results from continuing operations beginning in the third quarter of 2008. These schedules exclude the operating results of LPS, and other smaller operations from continuing operations. The exhibit also includes financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). FIS's management uses non-GAAP measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of annual operating budgets, and to evaluate the operating performance of its businesses and to compare its operating performance with that of its competitors. Therefore, management believes non-GAAP measures to be relevant and useful information for investors. The non-GAAP measures exclude certain items, which management believes are not indicative of core operating results, however, these items do impact our income statement, and management therefore utilizes non-GAAP measures as an operating performance measure in conjunction with GAAP measures, such as operating income or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
The information included in Items 2.02 and 9.01 within this Current Report are being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information included in Items 2.02 and 9.01 within this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of the historical financial data is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
On July 2, 2008, FIS completed the spin-off of Lender Processing Services, Inc. ("LPS"). Since the completion of the spin-off occurred subsequent to the reporting period ended June 30, 2008, generally accepted accounting principles do not allow presentation of LPS as a discontinued operation in our periodic filings until FIS presents operating results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2008.
Because of these requirements and desire to furnish additional information to investors to improve the understanding of the Company's operating performance, management is separately furnishing information which excludes the operations of LPS and other smaller operations which the company has exited. The purpose of the attached schedules is to recast the 2007 results from continuing operations by quarter and on an annual basis along with the first and second quarter of 2008 in a manner consistent with how FIS will report results from continuing operations beginning in the third quarter of 2008. These schedules exclude the operating results of LPS, and other smaller operations, which we have exited. As previously announced we anticipate exiting our Australian check operations through a sale of this business to a third party. These schedules do not reflect the results of our Australian check operations as discontinued operations.
