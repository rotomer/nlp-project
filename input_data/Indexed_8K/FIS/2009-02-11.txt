Exhibit 99.1
PRESS RELEASE
      Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), a leading global provider of technology services to financial institutions, today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008.
Jacksonville, Fla.  February 10, 2009
     Fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 0.8% to $862.0 million in U.S. dollars and increased 4.3% on a constant currency basis. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations totaled $49.9 million, or $0.26 per share compared to $0.24 per share in the 2007 quarter.
     Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 41.2% to $0.48 per share, compared to $0.34 in the prior year, and increased 44.1% to $0.49 per share in constant currency. The increase in earnings per share was attributable to improved operating performance, supplemented by lower interest expense, a reduction in the company's effective tax rate and a lower share count. Free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) increased to a record $148.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
     For the full year 2008, revenue increased 18.0% to $3.4 billion in U.S. dollars and 17.3% in constant currency. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations totaled $0.61 per share compared to $1.28 in 2007, which included an after-tax gain of $0.88 from the sale of Covansys stock. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations totaled $1.49 per share in 2008, an increase of 26.3% compared to $1.18 per share in 2007. Pro forma free cash flow more than doubled to $358.1 million in 2008 compared to $168.4 million in 2007.
     "It was a solid quarter and a very good year for FIS. Full year revenue and earnings per share came in at the high end of our expectations, and pro forma free cash flow grew to a record $358 million," stated William P. Foley, II, executive chairman of FIS. "Our management team and employees have done an excellent job managing through a very difficult environment to achieve these results."
     "FIS is well positioned to generate solid growth in profitability, earnings per share and free cash flow in 2009," added Lee A. Kennedy, president and chief executive
 
officer. "We will continue to pursue key growth and efficiency initiatives, while remaining intently focused on helping our customers manage through this difficult economic environment."
Divestitures and Discontinued Operations
     On October 13, 2008, FIS completed the sale of the operating assets of Certegy Australia, Ltd. Certegy Australia, along with previously disclosed business divestitures, is reported as a discontinued operation for the periods presented.
Reclassifications
     During the first quarter of 2008, the Company reclassified certain revenues related to eFunds, which was acquired in September 2007, from the International revenue channel to the Integrated Financial Solutions and Enterprise Solutions revenue channels. Accordingly, certain revenues related to eFunds in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation.
Supplemental Information
     Consolidated fourth quarter revenue increased 0.8% to $862.0 million in U.S. dollars, including a $30.1 million unfavorable impact related to foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the adverse effect of currency, revenue increased 4.3%, driven by 6.4% growth in Integrated Financial Solutions and 9.7% growth in International. Enterprise Solutions revenue declined 2.4% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by a $12.8 million decline in the Company's retail check guarantee business. Excluding Check Services' revenue from both periods, Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 2.8%.
     Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.3% to $226.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved 90 basis points to 26.3% compared to 25.4% in the prior-year quarter and increased 110 basis points sequentially from 25.2% in the third quarter of 2008. The improvement was driven by increased operating leverage, improved cost management and realized acquisition synergies, and slightly higher software license and equipment sales.
     The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 was 32.0% compared to 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2007. The current period tax rate was favorably impacted by the geographic distribution of income, a federal research and development tax credit and state tax planning.
 
Balance Sheet
     As of December 31, 2008, the company had $220.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. FIS repaid $134 million of debt during the fourth quarter, reducing the year-end total outstanding to $2.5 billion, of which $2.1 billion has been swapped to fixed interest rates. The effective interest rate was 5.1% as of December 31, 2008.
     During the quarter, FIS recorded an after-tax impairment charge of $35.3 million, or $0.18 per share, in conjunction with the Certegy Check Services trademark. As a result of the sale of our Australian business, approximately $0.09 per share is recorded in discontinued operations, while the remaining $0.09 per share is included in continuing operations. The write-down is excluded from adjusted net earnings for comparative purposes.
2009 Outlook
     The Company expects to report first quarter 2009 revenue of $820 to $830 million and adjusted net earnings of $0.30 to $0.32.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
     FIS reports several non-GAAP measures, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and adjusted net earnings, free cash flow and organic revenues. The adjusted results exclude the after-tax impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, certain stock compensation charges, LPS spin-off related costs, debt restructuring and other charges, gains (losses) on the sale of certain non-strategic assets and acquisition related amortization. Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS' non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures is included in the attachments to this release.
