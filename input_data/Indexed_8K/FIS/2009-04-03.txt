Robert M. Clements has notified the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (the "Company") that he does not wish to stand for re-election to the Board when his term expires at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders currently scheduled for May 28, 2009 (the "Annual Meeting"). Mr. Clements' decision not to stand for re-election was due to the time required by his other commitments, particularly his role as the chairman and chief executive officer of EverBank Financial Corporation, the holding company for EverBank, and was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matters relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices. In connection with Mr. Clements' decision not to stand for re-election, the Board has approved a reduction in the size of the Board from seven directors to six directors effective as of the date of the Annual Meeting.
