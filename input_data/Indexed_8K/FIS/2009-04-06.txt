There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Georgia or Wisconsin, as applicable, there have not been threatened within the past two years any, claims by any Person alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation by such Merger Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any other Person's Intellectual Property that, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Georgia or Wisconsin, as applicable.

In connection with any such Registration Statement, Georgia agrees to comply with the registration procedures set forth on attached hereto. Upon filing the Registration Statement, Georgia will, if applicable, cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective, will keep such Registration Statement effective with the SEC at all times (including by filing a new Registration Statement if such Registration Statement automatically expires), and shall cooperate in any shelf take-down by amending or supplementing the prospectus statement related to such Registration Statement as may be requested by any Investor or any transferees or as otherwise required, until the Investors or any transferees who would require such registration to effect a sale of the Registrable Shares no longer hold the Registrable Shares. The Investors will pay all Registration Expenses incurred by the Investors in connection with any Registration Statement. Georgia will use its commercially reasonable efforts to remain eligible to use Form S-3 registration or a similar short-form registration.
