Exhibit 99.1
PRESS RELEASE
      Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), a leading global provider of technology services to financial institutions, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.
Jacksonville, Fla.  April 28, 2009
     Consolidated revenue of $797.8 million declined 3.9% in U.S. dollars and increased 0.3% in constant currency compared to $830.3 million in the first quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings increased 19.2% to $0.31 per share in U.S. dollars, compared to $0.26 in the prior year, and increased 23.1% in constant currency. The increase is attributable to improved operating performance, lower interest expense and a lower share count, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders totaled $34.3 million, or $0.18 per share compared to $0.06 per share in the prior period. Free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) was $119.2 million compared with $4.9 million in the prior year quarter.
     "FIS's strong first quarter performance in the midst of ongoing economic uncertainty reflects the continued solid execution of our business plan and the strength of our operating model," stated William P. Foley, II, executive chairman of FIS.
     "We are very pleased with the strong growth in earnings, profit margins and free cash flow," stated Lee A. Kennedy, president and chief executive officer. "Despite very difficult market conditions, our disciplined focus on improving efficiency and managing costs drove a 100 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin, and contributed to the 19.2% increase in earnings per share. Although we expect challenging market conditions to persist throughout 2009, we remain confident in our ability to achieve solid earnings growth and strong free cash flow."
Supplemental Information
     Consolidated revenue in the first quarter of 2009 was $797.8 million, compared with $830.3 in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 3.9% in U.S. dollars. Excluding a $34.9 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency resulting from a strengthening of the U. S. dollar, consolidated revenue increased 0.3% driven by strong growth in International.
 
     Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.7% to $181.2 million in the first quarter of 2009 compared to $180.0 million in the 2008 quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved 100 basis points to 22.7% compared to 21.7% in the prior-year quarter, driven by increased operating leverage and ongoing expense management.
     The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2009 was 34.5% compared to 33.1% in the first quarter of 2008.
Balance Sheet
     FIS had $272.0 million in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2009. The company repaid $54.0 million of debt during the first quarter, reducing total debt outstanding to $2.46 billion, of which $2.1 billion has been swapped to fixed interest rates. The effective interest rate was 5.2% as of March 31, 2009.
     Continuing an intensive focus on capital spending, capital expenditures totaled $45.3 million in the quarter, which is a 42% reduction from the $78.3 million spent in the prior year.
 
Acquisition Update
     On April 1, 2009, FIS announced plans to acquire Metavante Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MV). The transaction is subject to approval by FIS and Metavante shareholders, receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Subject to receiving the required approvals, FIS expects to complete the transaction in the third quarter of 2009.
2009 Outlook
     FIS reaffirmed its full year outlook for adjusted net earnings of $1.60 to $1.66 per share. This guidance does not reflect the proposed acquisition of Metavante. FIS will update its fiscal 2009 guidance to include Metavante's results following the completion of the transaction.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
     Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions, and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the company has provided non-GAAP financial measures which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted net earnings, and free cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, LPS spin-off related costs, certain stock compensation charges and certain other costs. Adjusted net earnings exclude the after-tax impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, LPS spin-off related costs, certain stock compensation charges, acquisition related amortization and certain other costs. Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS's non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly-titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures is included in the press release attachments.

Forward-Looking Statements
      This press release contains forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals and projections, and statements about FIS's acquisition of Metavante, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Because such statements are based on expectations as to future economic performance and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The risks and uncertainties that forward-looking statements are subject to include, without limitation: changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets; the effect of governmental regulations, including the possibility that there are unexpected delays in obtaining regulatory approvals; the failure to obtain required transaction approvals from FIS's and Metavante's shareholders; the effects of our substantial leverage which may limit the funds available to make acquisitions and invest in our business; the risks of reduction in revenue from the elimination of existing and potential customers due to consolidation in the banking, retail and financial services industries or due to financial failures suffered by
 
firms in those industries; actions that may be taken by the competitors, customers and suppliers of FIS or Metavante that may cause the transaction to be delayed or not completed; failures to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace; our potential inability to find suitable acquisition candidates or difficulties in integrating acquisitions; competitive pressures on product pricing and services; and other risks detailed in the "Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information," "Risk Factors" and other sections of the Company's Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
