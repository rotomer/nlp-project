News Release
Fourth Quarter Highlights:
FIS (NYSE:FIS), a leading global provider of technology services to financial institutions, today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2009. These results include three months of operations from Metavante Technologies, Inc., which FIS acquired on October 1, 2009. For comparative purposes, references to pro forma measures assume that the merger was completed on January 1, 2008 and reflect adjustments in a manner consistent with 2009 adjusted results.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Feb. 4, 2010 
Adjusted revenue (which excludes the $15 million negative impact to deferred revenue from purchase accounting) increased 2.7% to $1.316 billion in U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to pro forma revenue of $1.281 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, and increased 0.4% in constant currency. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations totaled $167.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was $387.7 million, 11.5% higher as compared to $347.7 million in the prior year quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 240 basis points to 29.5%, driven by improved operating performance across all reporting segments, including the benefit of acquisition related cost savings. Strong earnings, higher deferred revenues and a favorable impact from the timing and amount of tax payments drove strong improvement in adjusted free cash flow to $237 million in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter consolidated revenue totaled $1.301 billion. During the quarter, FIS recorded acquisition related after-tax costs totaling $82.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. Additionally, the company incurred $87.6 million, or $0.23 per share, in after-tax charges related to the write-down of previously acquired trademarks and other assets in conjunction with the combination of FIS and Metavante and the company's comprehensive re-branding initiative. The deferred revenue adjustment impacted after-tax earnings by $9.8 million, or $0.03 per share. These combined charges, along with purchase price amortization on intangible assets acquired through various acquisitions, resulted in a net (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders of ($54.2 million), or( $0.14) per diluted share.
For the full year 2009, pro forma adjusted revenue decreased 0.8% to $5.052 billion in U.S. dollars compared to pro forma revenue of $5.092 billion in 2008, and increased 0.3% in constant currency. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA increased 9.7% to $1.428 billion, compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $1.302 billion in the prior year, and the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 270 basis points to 28.3% compared to 25.6% in 2008. On a GAAP basis, FIS reported consolidated
 
revenue of $3.770 billion and net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders of $101.3 million, or $0.42 per diluted share.
"Despite the highly challenging economic environment, 2009 was a very successful year for our company," stated FIS Chairman William P. Foley, II. "FIS generated excellent operating results and also completed the most significant acquisition in the company's history. These achievements provide a strong foundation for our continued growth and success."
FIS President and Chief Executive Officer Frank Martire added, "We are very pleased with the solid execution by our management team and employees around the world. We remain highly focused on serving the needs of our clients, and are encouraged by the pace of recent new customer wins. We are reaffirming our outlook for 17% to 23% growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2010, combined with strong margin expansion and increased cash flow."
Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations
On October 1, 2009, FIS completed the acquisition of Metavante Technologies, Inc. The transaction was treated as a purchase and the results of Metavante are included in the consolidated results of FIS beginning October 1, 2009. For comparative purposes, in accordance with management's desire to improve the understanding of the company's operating performance, the supplemental information provided below assumes the merger was completed on January 1, 2008 and combines Metavante's results with FIS's historical results on a pro forma basis.
In addition, FIS completed the sale of its ClearPar automated syndicated loan trade settlement business on January 1, 2010. The results of ClearPar are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Supplemental Information
The following supplemental information is presented on an adjusted pro forma basis, which management believes provides more meaningful comparisons between the periods presented. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS Web site, www.fisglobal.com.
Consolidated fourth quarter revenue increased 2.7% to $1.316 billion in U.S. dollars, compared with $1.281 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding a $29.3 million favorable foreign currency impact, consolidated revenue increased 0.4%.
     - Financial Solutions revenue declined 1.3% to $452.5 million compared to $458.4 million in the prior period, as increases in global commercial services revenue and software sales were more than offset by a reduction in professional services revenue.
     - Payment Solutions revenue declined 1.0% to $629.6 million compared to $635.9 million in the 2008 quarter as growth in debit and network solutions was more than offset by reduced termination fees and lower item processing, prepaid card and retail check activity.
     - International Solutions revenue increased 24.0% to $232.3 million in U.S. dollars, and 8.4% in constant currency compared to $187.3 million in the prior year quarter. Core processing revenue increased 6.4% driven by increased software sales and strong services revenue, while payments revenue increased 9.7% driven by organic account growth across all regions.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.5% to $387.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $347.7 million in the 2008 quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved 240 basis points to 29.5% compared to 27.1% in the prior-year quarter, driven by the realization of acquisition related synergies and ongoing expense management across all operating segments.
 
     - Financial Solutions EBITDA increased 0.6% to $197.6 million, while the margin improved 80 basis points to 43.7% compared to 42.9% in the prior year.
     - Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 0.3% to $219.0 million, and the margin increased 50 basis points to 34.8% compared to 34.3% in the prior year.
     - International EBITDA increased 90.2% to $63.9 million, which included a $5.3 million favorable currency impact. The EBITDA margin improved 960 basis points to 27.5% compared to 17.9% in the prior year due to increased software sales, improved operating leverage in payment and processing services and ongoing cost management activity.
The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 36.0%
Balance Sheet
FIS had $430.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt outstanding of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2009. The majority of FIS's debt has been swapped to fixed interest rates. The effective interest rate was 3.6% at year end.
Capital expenditures totaled $66.8 million in the quarter, compared to $85.9 million in pro forma capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2008.
2010 Outlook
The company reiterated the following 2010 guidance provided at its December 7, 2009 analyst day:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions, and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted revenue, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted net earnings, and adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted revenue excludes the impact of deferred revenue purchase accounting. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, LPS spin-off related costs, accelerated stock compensation charges associated with merger and acquisition activity, asset impairment charges and certain other costs. Adjusted net earnings exclude the after-tax impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, LPS spin-off related costs, accelerated stock compensation charges associated with merger and acquisition activity, acquisition related amortization and certain other costs. Adjusted free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures and acquisition related cash items. Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS' non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of
 
these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS Web site, www.fisglobal.com.
