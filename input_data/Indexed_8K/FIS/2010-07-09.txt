Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management.

FIS undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. The risks and uncertainties which forward-looking statements are subject to include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the FIS' expectations to close on the sale of the Notes and how FIS will use the proceeds of the offering and other risks detailed in the "Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information," "Risk Factors" and other sections of FIS' Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
