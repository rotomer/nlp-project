Item 5.04.  Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans
On July 30, 2010, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. ("FIS") notified its directors and executive officers that the trading restrictions on transactions in FIS equity securities by such persons that would have been implemented in accordance with Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR would not be implemented due to fewer than 50% of participants in the qualified retirement plans maintained by FIS electing by the applicable deadline to participate in FIS' self-tender offer for shares of its common stock (and, as a consequence, having the tendered portions of their plan accounts becoming subject to a temporary suspension in trading).
