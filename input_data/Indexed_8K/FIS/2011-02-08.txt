For the full year 2010, adjusted revenue increased
4.2%
to
$5.2
billion, compared to adjusted pro forma revenue of
$5.0
billion in 2009. Adjusted revenue increased

It was a strong quarter and a very good year for our company. Full year revenue growth and earnings per share exceeded our expectations, and we are excited about the momentum we have as we enter 2011, stated Frank Martire, president and chief executive officer of FIS. Our management team and employees have done an excellent job executing the business plan and the Metavante integration, while remaining focused on serving our clients. These efforts have placed FIS in an even stronger position to focus on continued growth and expansion.
 
 
Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations
On December 2, 2010, FIS completed the acquisition of Capco. Operating results from Capco are reported prospectively from the date of acquisition and are included in the Financial Solutions and International Solutions segments, based on geography.
 
On October 1, 2009, FIS completed the acquisition of Metavante. The transaction was treated as a purchase and the results of Metavante are included in the consolidated results of FIS beginning October 1, 2009. For comparative purposes, in accordance with management's desire to improve the understanding of the Company's operating performance, the following segment information assumes that the merger was completed on January 1, 2009 and combines Metavante's results with FIS' historical results on a pro forma basis for the first nine months of 2009.
 
During the third quarter of 2010, FIS determined that it will pursue strategic alternatives for its item processing and remittance services subsidiary in Brazil, Fidelity National Participacoes Ltda., and intensify its focus on expanding its card processing operation in the region. The results of Fidelity National Participacoes Ltda. are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented, along with the previously disclosed ClearPar business divestiture (revenues and expenses from discontinued operations are collapsed and classified as a separate line item on the income statement).
 
Segment Information
In order to provide more meaningful comparisons between the periods presented, the following segment information is presented on an adjusted basis for all periods. In addition, information for full year 2009 is presented on an adjusted pro forma basis, as if the merger with Metavante had been completed on January 1, 2009. Definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in subsequent sections of the press release narrative and supplemental schedules.
 
 
Fourth quarter 2010 Financial Solutions revenue increased
11.3%
to
$503.5
million compared to
$452.5
million in the 2009 quarter, driven by growth in professional services, increased processing revenues and the acquisition of Capco. Financial Solutions EBITDA increased
11.0%
to
$219.4
million, and the margin was
43.6%
compared to
43.7%
in the prior year quarter.
 
For the full year 2010, Financial Solutions revenue increased
7.0%
to
$1.9
billion compared to
$1.8
billion in 2009. Full year 2010 EBITDA increased
11.6%
to
$824.3
million and the margin expanded
180
basis points to
43.6%
compared to
41.8%
in 2009.
 
 
Fourth quarter 2010 Payment Solutions revenue of
$628.1
million declined
0.2%
compared to
$629.6
million in the 2009 quarter as growth in electronic payment services was offset by lower item processing and retail check activity. Additionally, consolidation of our merchant processing platforms resulted in utilization of the net method to account for certain merchant interchange fees. Payment Solutions revenue increased
3.8%
, excluding the check related businesses, which totaled
$121.8
million and
$135.3
million in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and the
$6.8
million unfavorable impact of the gross-to-net accounting mentioned above. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased
9.5%
to
$239.8
million, and the margin increased
340
basis points to
38.2%
compared to
34.8%
in the prior year.
 
For the full year 2010, Payment Solutions revenue decreased
0.3%
to
$2.5
billion. Payment Solutions
revenue increased
3.2%
excluding the check related businesses, which totaled
$486.4
and
$556.3
million, in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The full year impact of the gross-to-net accounting mentioned above was not significant. Full year 2010 Payment Solutions EBITDA increased
6.6%
to
$932.4
million and the margin expanded
240
basis points to
37.6%
compared to
35.2%
in 2009.
 
 
International Solutions revenue increased
25.0%
to
$268.2
million in U.S. dollars compared to
$214.5
million in the 2009 quarter. The growth was driven by increased payment volumes in Brazil, growth in professional services, higher license revenue and the acquisition of Capco. International Solutions EBITDA increased
25.3%
to
$81.3
million. The reported EBITDA margin was
30.3%
, which was consistent with the prior year quarter.
 
For the full year 2010, International Solutions revenue increased
12.5%
to
$833.7
million compared to
$741.0
million in 2009. Full year 2010 EBITDA increased
13.0%
to
$204.1
million, and the margin was
24.5%
compared to
24.4%
in 2009.
 
 
Corporate expense totaled
$95.9
million in the fourth quarter 2010, compared to
$92.8
million in the prior year quarter. Corporate expense declined to
$333.0
million for the full year 2010, compared to
$364.0
million in 2009.
 
Net interest expense was
$64.5
million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to
$35.3
million in the 2009 quarter. Full year interest expense, net of interest income, was
$172.9
million in 2010 compared to
$129.6
million in 2009. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the recapitalization completed in the third quarter of 2010.
 
The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 was
31%
compared to
36%
in the 2009 quarter. The fourth quarter tax rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of the full year benefit of the federal research and development tax credit resulting from legislation signed into law in the fourth quarter and the utilization of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for full year 2010 was
35%
, which was comparable to full year 2009. The full year tax rate was favorably impacted by the geographic distribution of income and tax planning.
 
Balance Sheet
Cash and cash equivalents totaled
$338.0
million as of December 31, 2010. Debt outstanding was approximately
$5.2
billion as of December 31, 2010. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled
$86.7
million, compared to
$66.8
million in capital expenditures in the prior year quarter. Full year capital expenditures totaled
$314.0
million compared to capital expenditures of
$212.5
million in 2009.
    
2011 Outlook
FIS provided the following guidance for 2011 as follows:
 
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-
GAAP measures include adjusted revenue, organic revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted net earnings, and adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted revenue (2010 and 2009 comparative data) includes pre-acquisition revenue for Metavante in 2009 and excludes a settlement related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil and the impact of deferred revenue purchase accounting. Organic revenue (2011 and 2010 comparative data) includes reported revenue plus pre-acquisition revenue for companies acquired during the applicable reporting periods. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency, the impact of deferred revenue purchase accounting and a settlement related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, accelerated stock compensation charges associated with merger and acquisition activity, costs associated with the 2010 recapitalization plan, settlement revenue and an impairment charge related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil, deferred revenue purchase accounting and certain other costs. Adjusted net earnings (2010 and 2009 comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, accelerated stock compensation charges associated with merger and acquisition activity, costs associated with the 2010 recapitalization plan, an impairment charge and settlement related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil, acquisition related amortization, deferred revenue purchase accounting and certain other costs. Adjusted net earnings (2011 comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization. Adjusted free cash flow (2010 and 2009 comparative data) is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures, acquisition related cash items and cash items associated with the 2010 recapitalization plan. Free cash flow (2011 comparative data) is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS' non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS Web site, www.fisglobal.com.
