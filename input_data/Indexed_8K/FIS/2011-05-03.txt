.

to
$1.38
billion in the first quarter of
2011
, compared to
$1.24
billion in the first quarter of
2010
. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders totaled
$96.1
million, or
$0.31
per diluted share, in the first quarter of
2011
, compared to
$97.1
million, or

Non-GAAP Results
Adjusted revenue growth was
11.2%
in the first quarter of
2011
, and organic revenue growth was 6.2%. EBITDA increased
0.9%
to
$368.3
million in the first quarter of
2011
, compared to adjusted EBITDA of
$365.1
million in the first quarter of
2010
. EBITDA margin was
26.6%
in the first quarter of
2011
, compared to
29.4%
, as adjusted, in the prior year quarter. The current year quarter reflects strong growth in lower margin businesses, including professional services and Capco, as well as approximately $7.0 million of integration and severance costs that are included in the current period. In addition, the Company incurred a loss of approximately $13.0 million associated with the Sunrise prepaid card platform in the first quarter of
2011
, as described later in this press release.
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations totaled
$137.7
million, or
$0.45
per diluted share, compared to
$156.5
million, or
$0.41
per diluted share, in the first quarter of
2010
. Integration and severance costs and the Sunrise prepaid loss reduced first quarter
2011
adjusted earnings by approximately $0.01 and $0.03 per share, respectively. Free cash flow totaled
$188.6
million compared to free cash flow of
$241.3
million, as adjusted, in the
2010
quarter. Definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in subsequent sections of the press release narrative and supplemental schedules.
Excellent growth in Financial Solutions and International Solutions drove the strong top-line performance, stated Frank Martire, president and chief executive officer of FIS. We are very pleased with the progress we are making in driving higher organic revenue growth, which we believe will drive sustainable earnings growth and value for our shareholders.
Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations
On December 2, 2010, FIS completed the acquisition of Capco. Operating results from Capco are reported prospectively from the date of acquisition and are included in the Financial Solutions and International Solutions segments, based on geography, while non-allocated overhead is included in the Corporate segment.
 
During the third quarter of
2010
, FIS determined that it will pursue strategic alternatives for its item processing and remittance services subsidiary in Brazil, Fidelity National Participacoes Ltda., and intensify its focus on expanding its card processing operation in the region. The results of Fidelity National Participacoes Ltda. are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented, (revenues and expenses from discontinued operations are collapsed and classified as a separate line item on the income statement).
 
 
Segment Information
 
The following is a discussion of first quarter results by segment:
 
First quarter
2011
Financial Solutions revenue increased
13.6%
to
$503.7
million compared to
$443.5
million in the
2010
quarter, driven by growth in professional services, increased processing revenues, including new client implementations, and the addition of Capco's North American operations. Financial Solutions revenue increased 7.1% on an organic basis. Financial Solutions EBITDA increased
4.6%
to
$195.1
million compared to
$186.5
million in the first quarter of
2010
. The EBITDA margin was
38.7%
compared to
42.1%
in the prior year quarter, reflecting continuing strong growth in professional services and the addition of Capco.
 
First quarter
2011
Payment Solutions revenue totaled
$614.5
million compared to
$618.8
million in the
2010
quarter as growth in electronic payment services, card production and output solutions was offset by lower item processing and retail check activity. Additionally, consolidation of our merchant processing platforms resulted in utilization of the net method to account for certain merchant interchange fees. Payment Solutions revenue increased 4.5%, excluding the check related businesses, which totaled $113.0 million and $122.2 million in the first quarters of
2011
and
2010
, respectively, and the $16.6 million unfavorable impact of the gross-to-net accounting mentioned above. Payment Solutions EBITDA was
$219.3
million compared to
$229.5
million in the
2010
quarter, and the EBITDA margin was
35.7%
compared to
37.1%
in the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in lower margin businesses, reduced license revenue and approximately $4.0 million of integration and severance costs that are included in the current period.
 
International Solutions revenue increased
48.6%
to
$268.1
million compared to
$180.4
million in the
2010
quarter. The growth was driven by increased payment volumes in Brazil, growth in professional services, higher license revenue and the addition of Capco's international operations. International Solutions revenue increased 27.5% on an organic basis. International Solutions EBITDA increased
44.2%
to
$48.9
million compared to
$33.9
million in the first quarter of
2010
. The EBITDA margin was
18.2%
compared to
18.8%
in the prior year quarter, reflecting a higher proportion of professional services including Capco in the current year.
  
Corporate expense totaled
$95.0
million in the first quarter
2011
, compared to
$84.8
million in the prior year quarter. Included in the current year quarter is a loss of approximately $13.0 million related to the Sunrise prepaid card platform, as described below.
 
Net interest expense totaled
$68.0
million in the first quarter of
2011
compared to
$28.2
million in the
2010
quarter. The increase was due primarily to the recapitalization completed in the third quarter of
2010
.
 
The effective tax rate in the first quarter of
2011
was
35%
compared to
37%
in the first quarter of
2010
.
 
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
Cash and cash equivalents totaled
$384.1
million as of
March 31, 2011
. Debt outstanding declined to approximately
$5.0
billion as of
March 31, 2011
. Capital expenditures totaled
$71.6
million in the first quarter of
2011
, compared to
$58.2
million in capital expenditures in the prior year quarter.
Free cash flow totaled
$188.6
million in the first quarter of
2011
compared to adjusted free cash flow of
$241.3
million in the
2010
quarter. The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to the timing of interest payments associated with the debt incurred as part of the August
2010
leveraged recapitalization and annual incentive payments.
 
Sunrise Loss
FIS incurred a loss of approximately $13.0 million, or $0.03 per share, during the first quarter of 2011 related to unauthorized activities involving one client and 22 prepaid card accounts on its Sunrise platform. The Company has identified that 7,170 prepaid accounts may have been at risk and that three individual cardholders' non-public information may have been disclosed as a result of the unauthorized activities. FIS worked with the impacted clients to take appropriate action, including blocking and reissuing cards
for the affected accounts. The Company has taken steps to further enhance security and continues to work with Federal law enforcement officials on this matter.
 
2011 Outlook
FIS reiterated its full year outlook for
2011
as follows:
    
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted revenue, organic revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted net earnings, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted revenue (2010 comparative data) excludes the impact of deferred revenue purchase accounting. Organic revenue (2011 and 2010 comparative data) includes reported revenue plus pre-acquisition revenue for companies acquired during the applicable reporting periods. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation in 2011 and the impact of deferred revenue purchase accounting in 2010. Adjusted EBITDA (2010 comparative data) excludes the impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, accelerated stock compensation charges associated with merger and acquisition activity, deferred revenue purchase accounting and certain other costs. Adjusted net earnings (2010 comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, accelerated stock compensation charges associated with merger and acquisition activity, acquisition related amortization, deferred revenue purchase accounting and certain other costs. Adjusted net earnings (2011 comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization. Adjusted free cash flow (2010 comparative data) is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures and acquisition related cash items. Free cash flow (2011 comparative data) is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS' non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS Web site, www.fisglobal.com.
