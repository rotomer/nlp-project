Third quarter
2011
Financial Solutions revenue increased
7.8%
to
$523.2
million compared to
$485.5
million in the

0.6%
on an organic basis. Financial Solutions EBITDA increased
1.9%
to
$224.0
million compared to
$219.8
million in the third quarter of
2010
. The EBITDA margin was
42.8%
compared to
45.3%
in the prior year quarter, reflecting the addition of Capco, lower license revenue, growth in lower margin services and approximately

million in integration and severance costs in the third quarter of
2011
.
Third quarter
2011
Payment Solutions revenue increased

million compared to
$600.6
million in the

quarter. Payment Solutions revenue increased
2.0%

million decline in the check-related businesses. Payment Solutions EBITDA totaled
$229.6
million in the third quarter of
2011
compared to
$230.9
million in the third quarter of
2010
. The decline was due primarily to
$4.3
million of integration and severance costs that are included in the current year quarter. The EBITDA margin was
38.0%
compared to
38.4%
in the prior year quarter.
International Solutions revenue increased
49.3%
to
$297.7
million compared to
$199.4
million in the
2010
quarter, and increased
21.9%
on an organic basis. The strong performance was driven primarily by continued strong growth in Brazil card processing and Capco's European business. International Solutions EBITDA increased
44.1%
to
$67.0
million compared to
$46.5
million in the third quarter of
2010
. Integration and severance costs of approximately
$1.2
million are included in the current year quarter. The EBITDA margin was
22.5%
compared to
23.3%
in the prior year quarter, reflecting the addition of Capco.
  
Corporate expense totaled
$82.6
million in the third quarter
2011

million in the prior year quarter. As previously disclosed, the prior year quarter included a benefit of approximately $10.0 million related to the reimbursement of legal expenses. Integration, severance and merger and acquisition costs of approximately
$2.9
million are included in the current year quarter.
Net interest expense totaled
$60.5
million compared to
$60.9
million in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate declined to
30.6%
in the third quarter of
2011
compared to
36.6%
in the prior year quarter due to the implementation of state and federal tax planning strategies and a non-recurring benefit related to the Company's international business. FIS anticipates that the full year tax rate for 2011 will be approximately 33%.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled
$386.8
million as of
September 30, 2011
. Debt outstanding totaled approximately

billion as of
September 30, 2011

Free cash flow totaled
$193.4
million in the third quarter of
2011
compared to adjusted free cash flow of
$220.4
million in the
2010
quarter due primarily to higher interest payments in the current year.
2011 Outlook
FIS updated its outlook for full year
2011
as follows:
    
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted revenue, organic revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted net earnings, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted revenue (2010 comparative data) excludes the impact of deferred revenue purchase accounting and a settlement related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil. Organic revenue (2011 and 2010 comparative data) includes reported revenue plus pre-acquisition revenue for companies acquired during the applicable reporting periods. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation in 2011, the impact of deferred revenue purchase accounting in 2010 and a settlement related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil. Adjusted EBITDA (2010 comparative data) excludes the impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, accelerated stock compensation charges associated with merger and acquisition activity, costs associated with the 2010 recapitalization plan, settlement revenue and an impairment charge related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil, deferred revenue purchase accounting and certain other costs. Adjusted net earnings (2010 comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, accelerated stock compensation charges associated with merger and acquisition activity, costs associated with the 2010 recapitalization plan, an impairment charge and settlement related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil, acquisition related amortization, deferred revenue purchase accounting and certain other costs. Adjusted net earnings (2011 comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization. Adjusted free cash flow (2010 comparative data) is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures, acquisition related cash items and cash items associated with the 2010 recapitalization plan. Free cash flow (2011 comparative data) is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS' non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS Web site, www.fisglobal.com.
