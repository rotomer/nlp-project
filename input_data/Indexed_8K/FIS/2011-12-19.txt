Second Amendment and Restatement of Credit Agreement; Refinancing of the Existing Term B Loans Thereunder; and Incurrence of Additional Term A-2 Loans and 2014 Revolving Credit Commitments Thereunder
On December 19, 2011, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. ("FIS"), the other financial institutions party thereto as Lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Administrative Agent"), as Administrative Agent, entered into a Second Amendment, Restatement and Joinder Agreement dated as of December 19, 2011 (the "Amendment Agreement"). Under the Amendment Agreement, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of January 18, 2007 (as amended and restated as of June 29, 2010 and supplemented by the Joinder Agreement dated as of July 16, 2010), among FIS and certain subsidiaries of FIS party thereto from time to time, as borrowers, the Administrative Agent, and certain other parties thereto (as amended and supplemented through July 16, 2010, the "Existing Credit Agreement"), was further amended and restated in the form of that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of January 18, 2007, amended and restated as of June 29, 2010, supplemented by the Joinder Agreement dated as of July 16, 2010, and further amended and restated as of December 19, 2011 (as supplemented, amended and restated through December 19, 2011, the "Restated Credit Agreement").
The Amendment Agreement amends the Existing Credit Agreement to refinance on December 19, 2011 all of the existing term loans maturing on July 18, 2016, which loans have a total outstanding principal balance of $1,481.3 million on December 19, 2011 (the "Existing Term B Loans") with new term loans in the total principal amount of $1,250.0 million (the "Repriced Term B Loans"). The Repriced Term B Loans bear the same maturity date as the Existing Term B Loans but have a reduced interest rate varying from time to time at the election of FIS between either a Eurocurrency Rate (subject to a Eurocurrency Rate floor of 1.00%) plus an applicable margin of 3.25% and a Base Rate plus an applicable margin of 2.25% (as compared to the Existing Term B Loans having an interest rate varying between either a Eurocurrency Rate (subject to a Eurocurrency Rate floor of 1.5%) plus an applicable margin of 3.75% and a Base Rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75%). On December 19, 2011, FIS prepaid the $231.3 million excess in principal amount of the Existing Term B Loans over the principal amount of the Repriced Term B Loans.
The Amendment Agreement also amends the Existing Credit Agreement to permit FIS to obtain by January 31, 2012 (x) additional commitments under the Restated Credit Agreement to increase the amount of the existing revolving credit commitments under the Restated Credit Agreement maturing on July 18, 2014 (the "2014 Revolving Credit Commitments") on the same terms as such existing commitments, and (y) additional term loans under the Restated Credit Agreement to increase the amount of the existing term loans under the Credit Agreement maturing on July 18, 2014 (the "Term A-2 Loans") on the same terms as such existing term loans.
In connection with the Restated Credit Agreement, on December 19, 2011, some of the lenders under the Restated Credit Agreement holding term loans maturing in January 18, 2012 (the "Term A-1 Loans") entered into a series of separate Conversion Agreements, each dated December 19, 2011 (collectively, the "Conversion Agreements"), which FIS and the Administrative Agent accepted. Under the Conversion Agreements, on December 19, 2011, a total of $47.5 million in principal amount of the
 
Term A-1 Loans held by those lenders were converted into Term A-2 Loans under the Restated Credit Agreement.
In connection with the Restated Credit Agreement, on December 19, 2011, some of the lenders under the Restated Credit Agreement holding existing revolving credit commitments terminating on January 18, 2012 (the "2012 Revolving Credit Commitments") entered into a series of separate Extension Agreements, each dated December 19, 2011 (collectively, the "Extension Agreements"), which FIS and the Administrative Agent accepted. Under the Extension Agreements, on December 19, 2011, the maturity date of a total of $9.0 million of 2012 Revolving Credit Commitments held by those lenders was extended so that they became 2014 Revolving Credit Commitments under the Restated Credit Agreement.
In connection with the Restated Credit Agreement, on December 19, 2011, FIS, the other financial institutions party thereto as lenders (the "Joinder Lenders"), and the Administrative Agent entered into a Commitment Increase and Joinder Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2011 (the "Joinder Agreement"). Under the Joinder Agreement, the Joinder Lenders agreed to make available to FIS under the Restated Credit Agreement (a) a total of $69.5 million in additional commitments under the 2014 Revolving Credit Commitments, upon the same terms as apply to the existing 2014 Revolving Credit Commitments under the Restated Credit Agreement; and (b) a total of $352.5 million in principal of additional Term A-2 Loans, upon the same terms as apply to the existing Term A-2 Loans under the Restated Credit Agreement.
After giving effect to the transactions occurring under the Amendment Agreement, the Restated Credit Agreement, the Conversion Agreements, the Extension Agreements and the Joinder Agreement, on December 19, 2011, (a) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan A-2 was $2,150.0 million, (b) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Repriced Term Loan B was $1,250.0 million, and (c) the aggregate amount of the 2014 Revolving Credit Commitments were $1,000.0 million. In addition, the Administrative Agent has received a commitment from a financial institution to provide an additional $50.0 million in 2014 Revolving Credit Commitments, which commitment FIS expects to be put in place in January 2012, which would increase the aggregate of funded loans and available commitments under the Restated Credit Agreement to $4,450.0 million.
The foregoing descriptions of the Amendment Agreement, the Restated Credit Agreement, the Conversion Agreements, the Extension Agreements and the Joinder Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual terms of such documents, copies of which are attached as Exhibits 10.1 (with respect to the Amendment Agreement and, through its Annex A, the Restated Credit Agreement), 10.2 (with respect to the Conversion Agreements), 10.3 (with respect to the Extension Agreements) and 10.4 (with respect to the Joinder Agreement) to this report and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.

FIS may redeem some or all of the Additional 2017 Notes before July 15, 2013 by paying 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a "make-whole" premium. FIS may redeem some or all of the Additional 2017 Notes on or after July 15, 2013 at specified redemption prices. In addition, before July 15, 2013, FIS may redeem up to 35% of the Existing 2017 Notes and Additional 2017 Notes, considered together, with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings.

FIS has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts:
 
 
 
FIS has also agreed to file a shelf registration statement to cover resales of Additional 2017 Notes under certain circumstances.

Such "Plan of Distribution" section shall also contain all other information with respect to such resales by Broker-Dealers that the Commission may require in order to permit such resales pursuant thereto, but such "Plan of Distribution" shall not name any such Broker-Dealer or disclose the amount of Initial Securities held by any such Broker-Dealer except to the extent required by the Commission.
Each of the Company and the Guarantors shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the provisions of Section 6(c) hereof to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for resales of Initial Securities acquired by Broker-Dealers for their own accounts as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, and to ensure that it conforms with the requirements of this Agreement, the Securities Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period ending on the earlier of (i) 90 days from the date on which the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is declared effective and (ii) the date on which a Broker-Dealer is no longer required to deliver a prospectus in connection with market-making or other trading activities.
The Company shall provide sufficient copies of the latest version of such Prospectus to Broker-Dealers promptly upon request at any time during such 90-day (or shorter as provided in the foregoing sentence) period in order to facilitate such resales.
 
SECTION 4. .
Shelf Registration
(a) If (i) the Company is not required to file an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or to consummate the Exchange Offer because the Exchange Offer is not permitted by applicable law or Commission policy, (ii) for any reason the Exchange Offer is not Consummated within 30 Business Days after the effective date of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, or (iii) with respect to any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (A) such Holder is prohibited by applicable law or Commission policy from participating in the Exchange Offer, or (B) such Holder may not resell the Exchange Securities acquired by it in the Exchange Offer to the public without delivering a prospectus and that the Prospectus contained in an Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not appropriate or available for such resales by such Holder, or (C) such Holder is a Broker-Dealer and holds Initial Securities acquired directly from the Company or one of its affiliates, then, upon such Holder's written request, the Company and the Guarantors shall
Shelf Registration.
(x) cause to be filed a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, which may be an amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (in either event, the "Shelf Registration Statement") on or prior to the later of (I) 60 days after the receipt of such a request from a Holder described in Section 4(a)(iii) and (II) 30 days after the date specified for Consummation of the Exchange Offer in this Agreement (or if such 30th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) (such date being the "Shelf Filing Deadline"), which Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for resales of all Transfer Restricted Securities (other than any such securities that were eligible to be exchanged in the Exchange Offer at the time of the Exchange Offer) the Holders of which shall have timely provided the information required pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof; and
(y) use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission on or before the 90th day after the Shelf Filing Deadline (or if such 90th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day).
Each of the Company and the Guarantors shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the provisions of Sections 6(b) and (c) hereof to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for resales of Initial Securities by the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities entitled to the benefit of this Section 4(a), and to ensure that it conforms with the requirements of this Agreement, the Securities Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of at least two years following the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement (or shorter period that will terminate when all the Initial Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement); that notwithstanding the foregoing or the requirements of the second paragraph of Section 3(c) or any provision in Sections 6(b) or 6(c) hereof, if the filing of any such supplement or amendment would require the Company to make a public disclosure of material non-public information and the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential such material non-public information (other than the avoidance of
provided, however,
 
its obligations hereunder), then the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice to the underwriter(s), if any, and selling Holders, delay the filing of any such supplement or amendment for a period not to exceed 30 days in any three month period and 120 days in any calendar year; that (x) the Company promptly thereafter complies with the applicable requirements of Section 6 hereof and (y) the required period for effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement shall be extended by the number of days during which such Registration Statement was not effective or useful.
provided
(b) No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to the Company in writing, within 15 Business Days after receipt of a request therefor, such information as the Company may reasonably request for use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus included therein or amendment or supplement thereto. Each Holder as to which any Shelf Registration Statement is being effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not materially misleading.
Provision by Holders of Certain Information in Connection with the Shelf Registration Statement.
SECTION 5. If (i) any Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement has not been declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the date specified for such effectiveness in this Agreement, (ii) the Exchange Offer has not been Consummated within 30 Business Days after the Effectiveness Target Date with respect to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or (iii) any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is filed and declared effective but shall thereafter cease to be effective or fail to be usable for its intended purpose without being succeeded promptly by a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement that cures such failure and that is itself immediately declared effective (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iii), a "Registration Default"), the Company hereby agrees that the interest rate borne by the Transfer Restricted Securities shall be increased by 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of any Registration Default and shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of the subsequent 90-day period, but in no event shall such increase in the aggregate exceed 0.75% per annum (any such increase, "Additional Interest"). Following the cure of all Registration Defaults relating to any particular Transfer Restricted Securities, the interest rate borne by the Transfer Restricted Securities will be reduced to the original interest rate borne by such Transfer Restricted Securities; that, if after any such reduction in interest rate, a different Registration Default occurs, the interest rate borne by the Transfer Restricted Securities shall again be increased pursuant to the foregoing provisions.
Additional Interest.
provided, however,
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the amount of additional interest payable shall not increase because more than one Registration Default has occurred and is pending and (ii) a Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities that is not entitled to the benefits of the Shelf Registration Statement (because, , such Holder has not elected to include information or has not timely delivered such information to the Company pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof) shall not be entitled to Additional Interest with respect to a Registration Default that pertains to the Shelf Registration Statement.
e.g.
 
All obligations of the Company and the Guarantors set forth in the preceding paragraph that are outstanding with respect to any Transfer Restricted Security at the time such security ceases to be a Transfer Restricted Security shall survive until such time as all such obligations with respect to such security shall have been satisfied in full.
SECTION 6. .

As a condition to its participation in the Exchange Offer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall furnish, upon the request of the Company, prior to the Consummation thereof, a written representation to the Company (which may be contained in the letter of transmittal contemplated by the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) to the effect that (A) it is not an affiliate of the Company, (B) it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, and has no arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate in, a distribution of the Exchange Securities to be issued in the Exchange Offer and (C) it is acquiring the Exchange Securities in its ordinary course of business. In addition, all such Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities shall otherwise cooperate in the Company's preparations for the Exchange Offer. Each Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees that any Broker-Dealer and any such Holder using the Exchange Offer to participate in a distribution of the securities to be acquired in the Exchange Offer (1) could not under Commission policy as in effect on the date of this Agreement rely on the position of the Commission enunciated in (available June 5, 1991) and (available May 13, 1988), as interpreted in the Commission's letter to Shearman & Sterling dated July 2, 1993, and similar no-action letters, and (2) must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with a secondary resale transaction and that such a secondary resale transaction should be covered by an effective registration statement containing the selling security holder information required by Item 507 or 508, as applicable, of Regulation S-K if the resales are of Exchange Securities obtained by such Holder in exchange for Initial Securities acquired by such Holder directly from the Company.

(a) The Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Holder (including, for the avoidance of doubt, each Initial Purchaser who may be a Holder) and (ii) each Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any Holder (any of the Persons referred to in this clause (ii) being hereinafter referred to as a "controlling person") and (iii) the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of any Holder or any controlling person (any Person referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) may hereinafter be referred to as an "Indemnified Holder"), to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions and expenses (including, without limitation, and as incurred, reimbursement of all reasonable costs of investigating, preparing, pursuing, settling, compromising, paying or defending any claim or action, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to any Indemnified Holder), joint or several, directly or indirectly caused by, related to, based upon, arising out of or in connection with any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are caused by, related to, based upon or arising out of or in connection with an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that is made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Company by any of the Holders expressly for use therein. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or any of the Guarantors may otherwise have.
 
In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought or asserted against any of the Indemnified Holders with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company or the Guarantors, such Indemnified Holder (or the Indemnified Holder controlled by such controlling person) shall promptly notify the Company and the Guarantors in writing; that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve any of the Company or the Guarantors of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement to the extent it is not materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights and defenses) as a result of such failure and shall not relieve the Company and the Guarantors from any liability that they may have to an Indemnified Holder other than under this Section 8. In connection with any such action or proceeding, the Company and the Guarantors will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that they shall jointly elect, by written notice delivered to such Indemnified Holder promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such Indemnified Holder, to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Holder to represent the Indemnified Holder and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8; that the Company and the Guarantors shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such action or proceeding, as incurred. In any such action or proceeding, any Indemnified Holder shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the Company and the Guarantors will not be liable to such Indemnified Holder under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Holder in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the defendants in such action include both the Indemnified Holder and the Company or the Guarantors, and the Indemnified Holder shall have reasonably concluded (based upon advice of counsel) that a conflict may arise between the positions of the Company or the Guarantors and such Indemnified Holder in conducting the defense of such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other Indemnified Holders which are different from or additional to those available to the Company or the Guarantors or (ii) the Company and the Guarantors shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Holder to represent such Indemnified Holder within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action; that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any one local counsel in each jurisdiction) at any time for such Indemnified Holders, which firm shall be designated by the Indemnified Holders. The Company and the Guarantors shall be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected with the Company's and the Guarantors' prior written consent, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably, and each of the Company and the Guarantors agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Holder from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of any settlement of any action effected with the written consent of the Company and the Guarantors. The Company and the Guarantors shall not, without the prior written consent of each Indemnified Holder that is or could have been a party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any pending or threatened action, claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Holder from all liability arising out of such action, claim, litigation or proceeding.

(b) Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors and their respective directors and officers who sign a Registration Statement, and any Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company or any of the Guarantors, and the respective officers who signed the Registration Statement, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of each such Person, to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions and expenses (including, without limitation, and as incurred, reimbursement of all reasonable costs of investigating, preparing, pursuing, settling, compromising, paying or defending any claim or action, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to any of such Persons), joint or several, directly or indirectly caused by, related to, based upon, arising out of or in connection with any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with respect to losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions and expenses (including, without limitation, and as incurred, reimbursement of all reasonable costs of investigating, preparing, pursuing, settling, compromising, paying or defending any claim or action, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel), directly or indirectly caused by, related to, based upon, arising out of or in connection with information relating to such Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement. In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company, the Guarantors or their respective directors or officers or any such controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given the Company and the Guarantors, and the Company, the Guarantors, their respective directors and officers who signed the Registration Statement and such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph.
(c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement (which in the case of the Company and the Guarantors shall be deemed to be equal to the total gross proceeds to the Company and the Guarantor from the Initial Placement and the amount of Additional Interest which did not become payable as a result of the filing of the Registration Statement resulting in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments actions or expenses) and such Registration Statement, or if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or
 
omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnified Holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company, the Guarantors and each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none of the Holders (and its related Indemnified Holders) shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount received by such Holder with respect to the Initial Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Initial Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.
SECTION 9. At any time when the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15 of the Exchange Act, the Company hereby agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding, to make available to any Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities from such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, unless all such Transfer Restricted Securities held by such Holder or beneficial owner are eligible to be sold without limitation or restriction under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
Rule 144A.
SECTION 10. No Holder may participate in any Underwritten Registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
Participation in Underwritten Registrations.
 
SECTION 11. If requested by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement, the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Transfer Restricted Securities in one Underwritten Offering. The investment banker(s) and managing underwriter(s) that will administer such offering will be selected by the Company. In no event shall the Company be required to reimburse any Holder for any underwriting commissions or discounts.
Selection of Underwriters.
SECTION 12.
Miscellaneous.

Section 2.12(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and evidenced by one or more entries in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent, acting solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c), as agent for the Borrowers, in each case in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to a Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, such Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans to such Borrower in addition to such

Any such Note evidencing a Loan prior to the Restatement Effective Date may be exchanged, upon the request of the relevant Lender made through the Administrative Agent and the surrender of such Note to the Company through the Administrative Agent, for Notes evidencing the Term A-2 Loans, the 2014 Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans and/or the 2014 US Dollar Revolving Credit Loans, as applicable, into which such Lender's Loans were converted on the Restatement Effective Date.
(b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.12(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records and, in the case of the Administrative Agent, entries in the Register, evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
(c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and (b), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and (b), shall be evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

Section 2.13(a) All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. (or, in the case of Section 2.06(a)(iii), 3:00 p.m.) on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent's Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the

Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m. (or, in the case of Section 2.06(a)(iii), 3:00 p.m.), in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(b) Unless a Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that such Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:
(i) if a Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Overnight Rate; and
(ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment with respect to any Committed Borrowing, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in Same Day Funds together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the "") at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate. When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included in the applicable Committed Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrowers, and the Borrowers shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Committed Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrowers may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
Compensation Period
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or a Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.13(b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(c) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article 2, and such funds
 
are not made available to the relevant Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article 4 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
(d) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan or purchase its participation.
(e) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
(f) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.03. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender.
(g) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.04(d), 2.05(c) or 9.07 (or if the Borrowers shall have paid any amount or posted any cash collateral in respect of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of Swing Line Obligations or L/C Obligations pursuant to Section 2.17(b)(ii)), then notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, with respect to any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, the Administrative Agent (i) shall apply such amounts (A) first, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender or the L/C Issuer to satisfy such Lender's obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and (B) second, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to reimburse the Borrowers for any cash collateral posted by the Borrowers until the Borrowers are fully reimbursed, and (ii) thereafter, may, in its sole discretion, hold any such remaining amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section; any amounts held pursuant to clause (ii) hereof shall be released to such Lender upon the earlier of (x) the date on which any of the actions described in Section 8.02(a), 8.02(b) or 8.02(c) or the proviso to Section 8.02 shall have been taken or occurred and (y) (A) in the case of amounts held against the obligations of a Term A-1 Lender, 2012 Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender or 2012 US Dollar Revolving Credit Lender, the 2012 Maturity Date, (B) in the case of amounts held against the obligations of a Term B Lender, the Term B Maturity Date and (C) otherwise, the 2014 Maturity Date.

The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 11.10) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.14 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the relevant Borrower shall within three Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all Swing Line Obligations and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the L/C Issuer only the relevant Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all L/C Obligations (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.04(g) for so long as such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all L/C Obligations is outstanding;
(iii) if the relevant Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all L/C Obligations pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(i) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all L/C Obligations during the period such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all L/C Obligations is cash collateralized;
(iv) if such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all L/C Obligations is reallocated to the non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Sections 2.04(i), 2.10(a) and 2.10(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Pro Rata Shares; and
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all L/C Obligations is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the L/C Issuer or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees and commitment fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender's Multicurrency Revolving Credit Commitment that was utilized by such L/C Obligations) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.04(i) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all L/C Obligations shall be payable to the L/C Issuer until and to the extent that such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of all L/C Obligations is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(c) so long as any Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swing Line Lenders shall not be required to fund such portion of any Swing Line Loan that equals such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Swing Line Loan, and the L/C Issuer shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless they are satisfied (in
 
their reasonable judgment) that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding Pro Rata Share of all L/C Obligations will be 100% covered by the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 2.17(b), and participating interests in any newly made Swing Line Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.17(b)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
(d) In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, any Swing Line Lender and the L/C Issuer each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lenders' Pro Rata Shares of the Swing Line Obligations and L/C Obligations shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Multicurrency Revolving Credit Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans of the other Lenders (other than Bid Loans and Swing Line Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, and such Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender.
Section 3.01(a) Except as provided in this Section 3.01, any and all payments by any Borrower to or for the account of any Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities (including additions to tax, penalties and interest) with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Agent and each Lender, (i) taxes imposed on or measured by its net income or overall gross income (including branch profits), and franchise (and similar) taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which such Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized, is (or was, during the relevant period) doing business or maintains a Lending Office, (ii) Excluded Taxes and (iii) all liabilities (including additions to tax, penalties and interest) with respect thereto (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "").

(b) If any Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Agent or any Lender, (i) except to the extent provided in Sections 3.01(e) and 3.01(f) below, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01), each of such Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
 
had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall make such deductions, (iii) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, such Borrower shall furnish to such Agent or Lender (as the case may be) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(c) Each Borrower also agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise, property, intangible or mortgage recording taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "").

(d) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Agent and each Lender for (i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.01) paid by such Agent or such Lender, and (ii) any liability (including additions to tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; such Agent or Lender, as the case may be, provides such Borrower with a written statement thereof setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of such amounts. Payment under this Section 3.01(d) shall be made within 30 days after the date such Lender or such Agent makes a demand therefor.
provided
(e) No Borrower shall be required pursuant to this Section 3.01 to pay any additional amount to, or to indemnify, any Lender or Agent, as the case may be, to the extent that such Lender or such Agent becomes subject to Taxes subsequent to the Original Closing Date (or, if later, the date such Lender or Agent becomes a party to this Agreement) as a result of a change in the place of organization of such Lender or Agent or a change in the Lending Office of such Lender, except to the extent that any such change is requested or required in writing by any Borrower (and provided that nothing in this clause (e) shall be construed as relieving any Borrower from any obligation to make such payments or indemnification in the event of a change in Lending Office or place of organization that precedes a change in Law to the extent such Taxes result from a change in Law).
(f) If a Lender or an Agent is subject to United States withholding tax with respect to a category of payments made pursuant to the Agreement at a rate in excess of zero percent at the time such Lender or such Agent, as the case may be, first becomes a party to this Agreement, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes with respect to payments of such nature unless and until such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such forms; that, if at the date of the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which a Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under clause (a) of this Section 3.01 in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date.
provided
 
(g) If any Lender or Agent shall become aware that it is entitled to receive a refund in respect of amounts paid by any Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.01, which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender or Agent is allocable to such payment, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall, within 30 days after the receipt of a request by such Borrower, apply for such refund; that in the sole reasonable judgment of the Lender or Agent, applying for such refund would not be disadvantageous to it.
provided
(h) If any Lender or Agent receives a refund in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which indemnification or additional amounts have been paid to it by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall promptly remit such refund (including any interest included in such refund) to such Borrower (to the extent that it determines that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be; that the relevant Borrower, upon the request of the Lender or Agent, as the case may be, agrees promptly to return such refund to such party in the event such party is required to repay such refund to the relevant taxing authority. Such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, shall, at such Borrower's request, provide such Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment or other evidence of the requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant taxing authority; that such Lender or Agent may delete any information therein that such Lender or Agent deems confidential.

provided
(i) Nothing in this Section 3.01 shall interfere with the right of a Lender or Agent to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige any Lender or Agent to claim any tax refund or to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or require any Lender or Agent to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other refunds, credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled.
Section 3.02If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
. Illegality.
 
Section 3.03If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or that the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, or that deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
. Inability to Determine Rates.
Section 3.04If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, in each case after the date hereof, or such Lender's compliance therewith, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this Section 3.04 any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Sections 3.01 and 11.16 shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income (including branch profits), and franchise (and similar) taxes imposed in lieu of net income taxes, by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized, is doing business or maintains a Lending Office, (iii) reserve requirements contemplated by Section 3.06 and (iv) the requirements of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank reflected in the Mandatory Cost to the extent the Mandatory Cost, as calculated hereunder, is sufficient to cover the cost to the applicable Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans but including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities (including additions to tax, penalties and interest) with respect thereto, on the Lender's loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, which are not Other Taxes), then from time to time within 30 days following written demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail such increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.08), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.
. Increased Cost and Reduced Return.
 
Section 3.05If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy and desired return on capital), then from time to time within 30 days following written demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.08), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
. Capital Adequacy.
Section 3.06(a) If any Lender is required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error).
. Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans.
(b) If any Lender is required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other Governmental Authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan. Any Lender requesting payment from any Borrower under Section 3.06(a) or (b) shall give such Borrower at least fifteen days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent). If a Lender fails to give notice fifteen days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or cost shall be due and payable fifteen days from receipt of such notice.
Section 3.07Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall promptly compensate (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to compensate) such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
. Funding Losses.
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
 
(b) any failure by any Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower; or
(c) any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency;
including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by such Lender to maintain such Loan, any foreign exchange losses or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company (or the applicable Designated Borrower) to any Lender under this Section 3.07, such Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loan was in fact so funded.
Section 3.08(a) Any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article 3 shall deliver a certificate to the Company contemporaneously with the demand for payment setting forth in reasonable detail a calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. For the avoidance of doubt, any additional amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.01(b) are not subject to the limitations set forth in this Section.
. Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation.
(b) With respect to any Lender's claim for compensation under any of Sections 3.01 through 3.07, no Borrower shall be required to compensate such Lender for any amount incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the relevant Borrower of the event that gives rise to such claim; that, if the circumstance giving rise to such increased cost or reduction is retroactive, then such 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. If any Lender requests compensation from any Borrower under any of Sections 3.04 through 3.06, such Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue from one Interest Period to another Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Rate Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.08(c) shall be applicable); that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.
provided
provided
(c) If the obligation of any Lender to make or continue from one Interest Period to another any Eurocurrency Rate Loan (or to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Rate Loans) shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.08(b) hereof, such Lender's Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then
 
current Interest Period(s) for such Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of an immediate conversion required by Section 3.02, on such earlier date as required by Law) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Sections 3.01 through 3.06 hereof that gave rise to such conversion no longer exist:
(i) to the extent that such Lender's Eurocurrency Rate Loans have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender's Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and
(ii) all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued from one Interest Period to another by such Lender as Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made or continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be converted into Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

(e) Each Lender agrees that (i) upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.01(b) or (d) with respect to such Lender it will, if requested by any Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts (subject to such Lender's internal policies and any legal or regulatory restrictions) to avoid the consequences of such event, including to designate another Lending Office for any Loan or Letter of Credit affected by such event and (ii) if any Lender (A) requests compensation under any of Sections 3.04 through 3.06, or (B) notifies any Borrower that it has determined that it is unlawful for its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, then such Lender will, if requested by such Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office for any Loan or Letter of Credit affected by such event; that in each case, such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and that nothing in this Section 3.08(e) shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of any Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Sections 3.01(b) or 3.01(d), 3.02 or 3.04 through 3.06.

If such U.S. Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to such U.S. Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable backup withholding tax imposed by the Code and the Borrowers shall not be liable for any additional amounts with respect to such withholding.
U.S. Lender
(c) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, and such failure arose because the Lender provided inaccurate, incomplete or invalid forms or other information to the Borrower or Administrative Agent under this Section 11.16, such Lender shall indemnify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (i) for any liability relating thereto, including all penalties and interest, (ii) any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent under this Section 11.16(c), and (iii) costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent.

Schedule 2.01
 

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 FIS (NYSE: FIS), the world's largest provider of banking and payments technology, today announced the completion of the amendment of its existing credit agreement and that, separately, it has closed its private offering of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% senior unsecured notes due July 15, 2017 (the "2017 Notes").
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 19, 2011
The amended credit facility includes $2.15 billion of Term Loan A maturing July 2014, $1.0 billion of revolving loan capacity maturing July 2014 and $1.25 billion of Term Loan B maturing July 2016. The amended facility provides FIS with $400.0 million of additional Term Loan A maturing July 2014 and $78.5 million of additional revolving loan capacity maturing July 2014. FIS also has arranged further commitments for an additional $50 million in revolving loan capacity maturing July 2014 under its credit facility, which commitments FIS expects will be put in place in January 2012. FIS will use the proceeds of the additional Term Loan A, the new Term Loan B and the $150 million of new 2017 Notes to extinguish $315 million of Term Loan A maturing January 2012 and $1.48 billion of existing Term Loan B, as well as to pay fees and expenses related to the amendment of the credit facility and the issuance of the senior notes. The new revolving loan capacity replaces revolving loan capacity that matures in January 2012.
The new Term Loan B bears interest based on LIBOR plus 3.25%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, compared to interest on the existing Term Loan B that was based on LIBOR plus 3.75%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.50%. The pricing of the Term Loan A maturing July 2014 and revolving loan capacity maturing July 2014 remains unchanged. The 2017 Notes have the same terms as the $600 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes FIS issued in July 2010. There was no material change to FIS's total or secured leverage as a result of the amendment.
In connection with the amendment of the credit facility, FIS expects to record a pre-tax charge of approximately $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the early extinguishment of debt and costs associated with the issuance of the new term loans.
The Additional 2017 Notes were offered and sold in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and outside
the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Additional 2017 Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold without registration unless pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and all applicable state laws. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the Notes in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.
JPMorgan Securities LLC, and Bank of America Securities, LLC, acted as joint lead arrangers of the credit facility.
