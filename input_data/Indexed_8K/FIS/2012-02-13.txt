Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and
in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future.
These non-GAAP measures include adjusted revenue, organic revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted net earnings, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted revenue (
2010
comparative data) excludes the impact of deferred revenue purchase accounting and a settlement related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil. Organic revenue (
2011
and
2010
comparative data) includes reported revenue plus pre-acquisition revenue for companies acquired during the applicable reporting periods. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation in
2011
, the impact of deferred revenue purchase accounting and a settlement related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil in
2010
.
Adjusted EBITDA in
2011
excludes a net benefit related to adjustments from the Capco acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA in
2010
excludes the impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, accelerated stock compensation charges associated with merger and acquisition activity, costs associated with the
2010
recapitalization plan, settlement revenue and an impairment charge related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil, deferred revenue purchase accounting and certain other costs.
Adjusted net earnings in
2011
exclude the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization, a non-cash charge related to an other than temporary decline in the market value of investments, debt refinancing costs and a net benefit related to adjustments from the Capco acquisition. Adjusted net earnings in
2010
exclude the after-tax impact of merger and acquisition and integration expenses, accelerated stock compensation charges associated with merger and acquisition activity, costs associated with the
2010
recapitalization plan, an impairment charge and settlement related to the card processing joint venture in Brazil, acquisition related amortization, deferred revenue purchase accounting and certain other costs.
Adjusted free cash flow (
2010
comparative data) is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures, acquisition related cash items and cash items associated with the
2010
recapitalization plan. Free cash flow (
2011
comparative data) is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures.
Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS' non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS Web site, www.fisglobal.com.
