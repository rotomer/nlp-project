Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include organic revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted net earnings and free cash flow. Organic revenue includes reported revenue plus pre-acquisition revenue for companies acquired during the applicable reporting periods. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation in
2012
. Adjusted EBITDA (
2012
comparative data) excludes accelerated vesting of certain stock options and restricted stock grants and for a non-compete and change in role payment. Adjusted net earnings (
2012
comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization, debt refinancing costs and accelerated vesting of certain stock options and restricted stock grants and for a non-compete and change in role payment. Adjusted net earnings (2011 comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization. Free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excludes the net change in settlement assets and obligations.
Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS' non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS Web site,
www.fisglobal.com
