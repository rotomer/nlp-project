Segment Information
The following is a discussion of second quarter results by segment:
Second quarter
2012
Financial Solutions revenue increased
9.1%
to
$563.4
million compared to
$516.5
million in the
2011
quarter and increased
7.8%
on an organic basis, driven by growth in processing revenue, global commercial services, professional services and consulting revenues. Financial Solutions EBITDA increased
3.2%
to
$215.0
million compared to
$208.3
million in the second quarter of
2011
. The EBITDA margin was
38.2%
compared to
40.3%
in the prior year quarter. The decline was driven primarily by a change in revenue mix and higher costs associated with
ongoing enhancements to information security.
Second quarter
2012
Payment Solutions revenue increased
0.4%
to
$606.1
million compared to
$603.6
million in the
2011
quarter, driven by growth in electronic transactions, which was partially offset by declining check volumes. Payment Solutions revenue increased
2.7%
, excluding the check related businesses, which totaled
$108.9
million and
$119.6
million in the second quarters of
2012
and
2011
, respectively. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased
8.6%
to
$249.6
million compared to
$229.9
million in the
2011
quarter. The EBITDA margin increased
310
basis points to
41.2%
compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting continued transaction growth and an ongoing focus on cost management.
International Solutions revenue decreased
1.9%
to
$287.3
million compared to
$293.0
million in the
2011
quarter and increased
10.0%
on an organic basis driven by growth across all major regions, including Europe. International Solutions EBITDA increased
3.4%
to
$63.3
million compared to
$61.2
million in the second quarter of
2011
, and the EBITDA margin increased
110
basis points to
22.0%
compared to the prior year quarter.
Corporate expense, as adjusted, totaled
$90.1
million in the second quarter
2012
, compared to
$92.9
million in the prior year quarter.
Net interest expense totaled
$56.6
million in the second quarter of
2012
compared to
$65.8
million in the
2011
quarter. The decrease was due primarily to lower borrowing costs.
The effective tax rate declined to
29%
in the second quarter of
2012
compared to
32%
in the second quarter of
2011
and
34%
in the first quarter of
2012
. The decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to a favorable resolution in the second quarter of
2012
of certain tax positions taken by the company. FIS anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 33% for full year
2012
.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
Cash and cash equivalents totaled
$533.8
million as of
June 30, 2012
. Debt outstanding totaled approximately
$4.9
billion as of
June 30, 2012
.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled
$258.8
million in the second quarter of
2012
compared to
$263.3
million in the second quarter of
2011
. The decrease was due primarily to a payment of approximately
$28
million to our Brazil joint venture partner. Capital expenditures totaled
$90.6
million in the second quarter of
2012
, compared to
$68.0
million in capital expenditures in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily related to additional investments in information security. Free cash flow, excluding settlement activity related to the payments businesses, totaled
$178.2
million in the second quarter of
2012
compared to
$185.0
million in the
2011
quarter.
FIS repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares during the quarter at a total cost of approximately $50 million. Approximately $950 million remains under the existing authorization.
Sale of Healthcare Benefit Solutions Business
On June 25, 2012, FIS announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to sell its Healthcare Benefit Solutions business. The transaction is expected to be completed during the third quarter of
2012
.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Healthcare Benefit Solutions business is classified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The related reclassification reduced adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately $0.02 in the second quarter of
2012
.
The Company expects to receive after-tax proceeds of approximately $220 million in conjunction with the transaction. Depending on reinvestment of the net proceeds, FIS expects the sale to reduce full year
2012
earnings from continuing operations by up to $0.07 per share, and expects no material impact to adjusted earnings per share in 2013.
In addition, FIS anticipates that it will incur an after-tax GAAP loss of approximately $55 million, or $0.19 per share, upon completion of the sale in the third quarter.
2012 Outlook
The Company updated its full year 2012 outlook for earnings from continuing operations to $2.45 to $2.55 per share, as adjusted, which represents approximately 10% to 15% growth in comparable earnings per share of $2.22 from continuing operations, as adjusted, in 2011.   The change to the Company's previous 2012 guidance of $2.47 to $2.57 per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, reflects a $0.07 per share reduction related to the reclassification of the Healthcare Benefit Solutions business as a discontinued operation and a $0.05 per share benefit related to the lower anticipated effective tax rate.  FIS reiterated its previous outlook for organic revenue growth, EBITDA growth and margin expansion for full year 2012 as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include organic revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted net earnings and free cash flow. Organic revenue includes reported revenue plus pre-acquisition revenue for companies acquired during the applicable reporting periods. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation in
2012
. Adjusted EBITDA (
2012
comparative data) excludes accelerated vesting of certain stock options and restricted stock grants and costs related to a non-compete and change in role payment. Adjusted net earnings (
2012
comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization, debt refinancing costs, accelerated vesting of certain stock options and restricted stock grants and for a non-compete and change in role payment and the anticipated loss related to the sale of the company's healthcare business. Adjusted net earnings (
2011
comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization. Free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excludes the net change in settlement assets and obligations.
Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS' non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS Web site,
www.fisglobal.com
.
