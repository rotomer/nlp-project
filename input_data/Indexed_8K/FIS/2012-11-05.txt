Segment Information
The following is a discussion of third quarter results by segment:
Third quarter
2012
Financial Solutions revenue increased
8.1%
to
$565.7
million compared to
$523.2
million in the
2011
quarter and rose
7.0%
on an organic basis, driven by growth in processing revenue, consulting revenue and global commercial services. Financial Solutions EBITDA was
$224.4
million compared to
$224.0
million in the third quarter of
2011
. The EBITDA margin was
39.7%
compared to
42.8%
in the prior-year quarter. The decline was driven primarily by higher investments associated with information security and a change in revenue mix, including lower license revenue coupled with strong growth in services and consulting revenues.
Third quarter
2012
Payment Solutions revenue totaled
$576.1
million compared to
$575.7
million in the
2011
quarter. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by the deconversion of a large debit issuing client which offset strong growth in bill payment and network solutions. Payment Solutions revenue increased
1.6%
, excluding the check related businesses, which totaled
$106.9
million and
$114.0
million in the third quarters of
2012
and
2011
, respectively. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased
6.1%
to
$234.6
million compared to
$221.1
million in the
2011
quarter. The EBITDA margin increased
230
basis points to
40.7%
compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting the benefits of ongoing expense management.
International Solutions revenue decreased
0.7%
to
$295.5
million compared to
$297.7
million in the
2011
quarter and increased
11.9%
on an organic basis driven by growth across all major regions. International Solutions EBITDA increased
6.6%
to
$71.4
million compared to
$67.0
million in the third quarter of
2011
, and the EBITDA margin expanded
170
basis points to
24.2%
compared to the prior-year quarter.
Corporate expense, as adjusted, totaled
$88.2
million in the third quarter
2012
, compared to
$81.9
million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was due in part to higher investments associated with information security.
Net interest expense totaled
$54.0
million in the third quarter of
2012
compared to
$60.5
million in the
2011
quarter. The decrease was due primarily to lower borrowing rates and lower debt outstanding.
The effective tax rate increased to
34%
in the third quarter of
2012
compared to
30%
in the third quarter of
2011
and
29%
in the second quarter of
2012
. The effective tax rates in both prior periods were reduced by the favorable resolution of certain tax positions taken by the Company. FIS anticipates an effective tax rate of approximately 33% for full year
2012
.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
Cash and cash equivalents totaled
$576.6
million as of
September 30, 2012
. Debt outstanding totaled approximately
$4.5
billion as of
September 30, 2012
.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled
$255.4
million in the third quarter of
2012
compared to
$275.5
million in the third quarter of
2011
. Capital expenditures totaled
$70.7
million in the third quarter of
2012
, compared to
$82.1
million in capital expenditures in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow, which excludes settlement activity related to the payments businesses, totaled
$193.2
million in the third quarter of
2012
compared to
$193.1
million in the
2011
quarter.
FIS repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares in the third quarter at a total cost of approximately $100 million. Year to date, FIS has repurchased 8.3 million shares at a total cost of approximately $251 million. Approximately $850 million remains under the existing share repurchase authorization.
Sale of Healthcare Benefit Solutions Business
On August 15, 2012, FIS completed the sale of its Healthcare Benefit Solutions business in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $335 million (approximately $220 million after tax). The Company incurred an after-tax GAAP loss of approximately $56 million related to the sale, which is included in discontinued operations. The Healthcare Benefit Solutions business is classified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in accordance with GAAP.
2012 Outlook
The Company reiterated its full year
2012
outlook as follows:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include organic revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted net earnings and free cash flow. Organic revenue includes reported revenue plus pre-acquisition revenue for companies acquired during the applicable reporting periods. Organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation in
2012
. Adjusted EBITDA (
2012
comparative data) excludes accelerated vesting of certain stock options and restricted stock grants and costs related to a non-compete and change in role payment. Adjusted net earnings (
2012
comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization, debt refinancing costs, accelerated vesting of certain stock options and restricted stock grants and for a non-compete and change in role payment. Adjusted net earnings (
2011
comparative data) exclude the after-tax impact of acquisition related amortization. Free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excludes the net change in settlement assets and obligations.
Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FIS' non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS Web site,
