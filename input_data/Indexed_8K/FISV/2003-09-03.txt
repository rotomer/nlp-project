EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
 
Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this Annual Report are forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors affecting the Company's operations, markets, services and related products, prices and other factors discussed in the Company's prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are subject to change at any time, actual results could differ materially from expected results. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.
 
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The Company's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company's management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management.
 
The Company has identified that its accounting policy regarding intangible assets and goodwill is critical to the Company's results of operations and financial position. The Company has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the implementation of SFAS No. 142 by comparing such amounts to their fair values. The Company determined that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets did not exceed their respective fair values. The Company is required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. When determining fair value, the Company uses various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Given the significance of goodwill and other intangible asset balances, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to the Company's financial statements.
 
The Company does not participate in, nor has it created, any off-balance sheet special purpose entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than operating leases. In addition, the Company does not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and uses derivative financial instruments primarily for managing its exposure to changes in interest rates.
 
 
MARKET RISK
 
Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, interest rates, indices, correlations or other market factors, such as liquidity, will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments. The Company is exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on investments and borrowings. The Company actively monitors these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management.
 
The Company's trust administration subsidiaries accept money market account deposits from trust customers and invest those funds in marketable securities. Substantially all of the investments are rated within the highest investment grade categories for securities. The Company's trust administration subsidiaries utilize simulation models for measuring and monitoring interest rate risk and market value of portfolio equities. A formal Asset Liability Committee of the Company meets quarterly to review interest rate risks, capital ratios, liquidity levels, portfolio diversification, credit risk ratings and adherence to investment policies and guidelines. Substantially all of the investments at December 31, 2002, have contractual maturities of one year or less except for government agency and certain fixed income mortgage backed obligations, which have an average duration of approximately one year and six months. The Company does not believe any significant change in interest rates would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 
The Company manages its debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating-rate debt and through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company uses interest rate swaps to partially hedge its exposure to interest rate changes, and to control its financing costs. Generally, under these swaps, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed principal amount. While changes in interest rates could decrease the Company's interest income or increase its interest expense, the Company does not believe that it has a material exposure to changes in interest rates, primarily due to $200.0 million of fixed interest rate swap agreements in place at December 31, 2002. Based on the Company's current borrowings under its credit and commercial paper facility of $393.3 million, a 1% increase in the Company's borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense related to the credit facility by $1.9 million. Based on the controls in place, management believes the risks associated with financial instruments at December 31, 2002, will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
The Company is a leading independent provider of financial data processing systems and related information management services and products to financial institutions and other financial intermediaries. The Company's operations have been classified into four business segments: Financial institution outsourcing, systems and services ("FIS"); Health plan management services; Securities processing and trust services; and All other and corporate. The following table sets forth, for the period indicated, certain amounts included in the Company's consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to processing and services revenues, and the percentage change in those amounts from period to period. This information should be read along with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. The following table and discussion exclude the revenues and expenses associated with customer reimbursements recorded in accordance with EITF No. 01-14 as explained in Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 
PROCESSING AND SERVICES REVENUES
 
Total processing and services revenues increased $350.6 million, or 18%, in 2002 and $241.2 million, or 14%, in 2001. Revenue growth was derived from sales to new clients, existing client growth, cross-sales to existing clients, price increases and revenues from acquired companies. Revenue growth was positively impacted by revenue growth of $214.7 million in 2002 and $249.3 million in 2001 in the FIS segment. The FIS segment's revenue growth in 2002 was negatively impacted by a decrease in European revenue of $36.0 million in 2002 compared to 2001 related to the Company's international banking system primarily due to reduced customer spending on professional services. Total revenue growth was also positively impacted by revenue growth in the Health plan management services segment of $160.5 million in 2002 and $55.6 million in 2001 primarily due to revenues from acquired companies. In addition, total revenue growth was negatively impacted by a decline in revenues of $31.2 million in 2002 and $66.4 million in 2001 in the Securities processing and trust services segment due to continued weakness in the United States retail financial markets. The internal revenue growth rate for the Company was approximately 4% in 2002 (excluding a business disposition and a $12.0 million customer termination fee in 2001).
 
 
COST OF REVENUES
 
Total cost of revenues increased $261.3 million, or 17%, in 2002 and $201.9 million, or 15%, in 2001. As a percent of processing and services revenues, cost of revenues were 81% in 2002, 82% in 2001 and 81% in 2000.
 
Cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $267.9 million, or 19%, in 2002 and $203.0 million, or 17% in 2001. The increases in these cost of revenues is due primarily to acquired businesses and continued growth in the FIS and Health plan management services segments. The make up of cost of revenues each year has been affected by business acquisitions and changes in the mix of the Company's business. In 2001, the Company recorded charges of $12.3 million, as explained in Note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $6.6 million in 2002 and $1.1 million in 2001. The decrease in 2002 was primarily attributable to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 that resulted in a reduction of goodwill amortization expense of approximately $24.0 million in 2002, offset primarily by incremental depreciation and amortization expense from capital expenditures and other intangible assets subject to amortization. The decrease in 2001 was primarily due to an impairment charge of $11.0 million recorded in the FIS segment in 2000, offset by amortization associated with acquisitions and incremental depreciation expense on capital expenditures.
 
OPERATING INCOME
 
Operating income increased $89.3 million, or 25%, in 2002 and $39.4 million, or 13%, in 2001. Operating income in the FIS segment increased $73.4 million in 2002 and $90.8 million in 2001. The increase in operating income in 2002 compared to 2001 in the FIS segment was due to a number of factors, including revenue growth across its business lines, acquisitions and the elimination of goodwill amortization of approximately $18.7 million. Operating income in the Health plan management services segment increased $23.4 million in 2002 and $10.7 million in 2001 primarily due to acquired businesses. Operating income in the Securities processing and trust services segment decreased $6.0 million in 2002 and $60.6 million in 2001, primarily due to continued weakness in the United States retail financial markets.
 
REALIZED GAIN FROM SALE OF INVESTMENT
 
During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded a pre-tax realized gain from sale of investment of $2.4 milion, $5.4 million and $7.8 million, respectively.
 
INCOME TAX PROVISION
 
The effective income tax rate was 39% in 2002, 40% in 2001 and 41% in 2000. The effective income tax rate for 2002 declined from 2001 due to the impact of adopting SFAS No. 142. The income tax rate for 2003 is expected to remain at 39%.
 
NET INCOME
 
Net income for 2002 increased $57.9 million, or 28%, in 2002 and $31.2 million, or 18%, in 2001. Net income per share-diluted (excluding realized gain from sale of investment) for 2002 was $1.36 compared to $1.07 in 2001 and $0.91 in 2000. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 142 would have increased 2001 and 2000 net income per share-diluted (excluding realized gain from sale of investment) by approximately $0.09 per share each year due to the elimination of goodwill amortization.
 
The Company's growth has been accomplished, to a significant degree, through the acquisition of businesses which are complementary to its operations. Management believes that a number of acquisition candidates are available which would further enhance the Company's competitive position and plans to pursue them vigorously. Management is engaged in an ongoing program to reduce expenses related to acquisitions by eliminating operating redundancies. The Company's approach has been to move slowly in achieving this goal in order to minimize the amount of disruption experienced by its clients and the potential loss of clients due to this program.
 
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
The following table summarizes the Company's primary sources (uses) of funds during the years ended December 31:
 
 
Cash flow from operations before securities processing receivables and payables increased 41% in 2002, reaching $512.9 million. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $482.8 million of long-term debt, while shareholders' equity exceeded $1.8 billion. Long-term debt includes $393.3 million borrowed under the Company's credit and commercial paper facility of which $143.3 million is payable under a 364-day agreement in 2003 and $250.0 million is payable in 2004 or earlier at the Company's option. The Company expects to renew its 364-day agreement prior to expiration in the second quarter of 2003. At December 31, 2002, cash and cash equivalents were $227.2 million, an increase of $91.2 million from December 31, 2001, after spending $406.6 million on acquired businesses in 2002.
 
        At December 31, 2002, the Company's remaining commitments consist primarily of operating leases for office facilities and equipment aggregating $373.2 million, of which $86.3 million will be incurred in 2003. The Company believes that its cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds will be adequate to meet its operating requirements, debt repayments, contingent payments in connection with business acquisitions and ordinary capital spending needs. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $53.7 million available for borrowing and $227.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the event that the Company makes significant future acquisitions, however, it may raise funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of securities.
 
The Company's current policy is to retain earnings to support future business opportunities, rather than to pay dividends. During 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 4.9 million shares of the Company's common stock. Shares purchased under the authorization will be made through open market transactions that may occur from time to time as market conditions warrant. Shares acquired will be held for issuance in connection with acquisitions and employee stock option and purchase plans. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 1.7 million shares remained available under the repurchase authorization.

1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fiserv, Inc. and all majority owned subsidiaries (the "Company"). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.
 
 
USE OF ESTIMATES
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
 
FAIR VALUES
 
The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, securities processing receivables and payables, customer funds held and retirement account deposits, short-term borrowings and accrued expenses approximate the carrying values due to the short period of time to maturity. The fair value of investments is determined based on quoted market prices. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated using discounted cash flows based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rates and the fair value of derivative instruments is determined based on dealer quotes (see Note 3).
 
 
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
 
The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes. The Company's accounting method for derivative financial instruments is based upon the designation of such instruments as cash flow hedges under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in net income. It is the policy of the Company to execute such instruments with creditworthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
 
 
REVENUE RECOGNITION
 
Revenues from the sale of data processing services, plastic card services, document solutions, consulting and administration fees on trust accounts are recognized as the related services are provided or when the product is shipped. Revenues from the sale of securities processing services are recognized as securities transactions are processed on a trade-date basis. Revenues from securities processing and trust services include net investment income of $95.4 million, $101.6 million and $124.3 million, net of direct credits to customer accounts of $20.0 million, $45.2 million and $94.1 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Revenues from software license fees (representing approximately 6%, 8% and 8% of 2002, 2001 and 2000 processing and services revenues) are recognized when written contracts are signed, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Maintenance fee revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related support period, generally 12 months.
 
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.
 
 
SECURITIES PROCESSING RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES
 
The Company's securities processing subsidiaries had receivables from and payables to brokers or dealers and clearing organizations related to the following at December 31:
 
 
Securities failed to deliver and failed to receive represent the contract value of securities that have not been delivered or received as of the settlement date. Securities borrowed and loaned represent deposits made to or received from other broker-dealers. Receivables from and payables to customers represent amounts due or payable on cash and margin transactions.
 
INVESTMENTS
 
The Company's trust administration subsidiaries accept money market deposits from trust customers and invest the funds in securities. Such amounts due trust depositors represent the primary source of funds for the Company's investment securities and amounted to $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Investments in government agency and certain fixed income obligations had an average duration of approximately one year and six months at December 31, 2002. These investments are accounted for as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost as the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments to maturity.
 
Available for sale investments are carried at market, based upon quoted market prices. Unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investments are accumulated in shareholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related deferred income taxes. Related gross unrealized gains were $65.6 million and $142.2 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Realized gains or losses are computed based on specific identification of the investments sold.
 
The following summarizes the Company's investments at December 31:
 
 
 
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to 40 years. Property and equipment consist of the following at December 31:
 
 
 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
 
Intangible assets consist of the following at December 31:
 
 
Software development costs for external customers include internally generated computer software for external customers and software acquired in conjunction with acquisitions of businesses. The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred to develop new software or enhance existing software which is marketed externally or utilized by the Company to process customer transactions in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed." Costs are capitalized commencing when the technological feasibility of the software has been established. Routine maintenance of software products, design costs and development costs incurred prior to establishment of a product's technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Amortization of all software is computed on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the product, generally three to five years.
 
Gross software development costs for external customers capitalized for new products and enhancements to existing products totaled $44.9 million, $36.6 million and $34.0 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Amortization of previously capitalized development costs, included in depreciation and amortization, was $38.3 million, $35.5 million and $35.9 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, resulting in net capitalized (amortized) development costs of $6.6 million, $1.1 million and $(1.9 million) in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
 
Customer base intangible assets represent customer contracts and relationships obtained as part of acquired businesses and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from five to 20 years. Other intangible assets consist primarily of non-compete agreements, which are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives, and trade names that have been determined to have indefinite lives and therefore, as of January 1, 2002, are no longer amortized in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
 
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $74.8 million, $58.0 million and $65.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Aggregate amortization expense with respect to existing intangible assets with finite lives resulting from acquisitions of businesses should approximate $20.0 million annually.
 
 
GOODWILL
 
On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, the Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. The Company completed its transitional impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and determined that no impairment exists. Pro forma net income and net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, adjusted to eliminate historical amortization of goodwill and related tax effects, are as follows:
 
 
The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by business segment during the year ended December 31, 2002 are as follows:
 
 
 
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
 
The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of recovering the cost of long-lived assets based on current and projected operating results and cash flows of the related business operations using undiscounted cash flow analyses. These factors, along with management's plans with respect to the operations, are considered in assessing the recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on discounted operating cash flows. During 2000, the Company recorded a charge of $11.0 million for impairment of goodwill associated with
 
the consolidation of certain ancillary product lines in the Company's software businesses. This charge was recorded in the Financial institution outsourcing, systems and services segment as additional amortization of intangible assets.
 
 
SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
 
The Company's securities and trust processing subsidiaries had short-term loans payable of $100.0 million and $112.8 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, with interest at an average rate of 1.9% and 1.8% as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and were collateralized by investments and customers' margin account securities.
 
 
INCOME TAXES
 
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the Company's income for accounting and tax purposes.
 
 
NET INCOME PER SHARE
 
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the periods. Common equivalent shares consist of stock options and are computed using the treasury stock method. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company excluded 1.3 million shares under stock options from the calculation of common equivalent shares as the impact was anti-dilutive.
 
 
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
 
The Company has accounted for its stock based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (see Note 5).
 
 
SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
 
The Company has a shareholder rights plan. Under this plan, each shareholder holds one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock held. The stock purchase rights are not exercisable until certain events occur.
 
 
ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
 
Accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of the following at December 31:
 
 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
 
 
 
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 01-14, "Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out of Pocket' Expenses Incurred," which requires that customer reimbursements received for direct costs paid to third parties and related expenses be characterized as revenue. Comparative financial statements for 2001 and 2000 have been reclassified to provide consistent presentation. In accordance with EITF No. 01-14, the Company has presented customer reimbursement revenue and expenses of $291.2 million, $262.2 million and $243.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Customer reimbursements represent direct costs paid to third parties primarily for postage and data communication costs. The adoption of EITF No. 01-14 did not impact the Company's financial position, operating income or net income.
 
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of. The impact of adopting this statement did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 
In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes EITF No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." The Company will adopt SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003 and does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 
 
2.    Acquisitions
 
During 2002, 2001 and 2000 the Company completed the following acquisitions of businesses. The results of operations of all of these acquired businesses have been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income from the dates of acquisition.
 
 
During 2002, the Company completed five acquisitions accounted for as purchases. Net cash paid for these acquisitions was $366.9 million, subject to certain adjustments. Goodwill recorded in conjunction with all of these acquisitions was $290.6 million. Pro forma combined results of operations are not presented, other than in connection with the acquisition of EDS Corporation's Consumer Network Services ("CNS") business as shown below, since the results of operations as reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of income would not be materially different.
 
On December 5, 2002, the Company acquired CNS for $305.8 million, net of $17.4 million of cash acquired, subject to certain adjustments. The following unaudited pro forma combined information is provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon as necessarily being indicative of the historical results that would have been obtained if this acquisition had actually occurred during those periods, or the results that may be obtained in the future.
 
 
At December 31, 2002, the preliminary purchase price allocation for the CNS acquisition resulted in goodwill of $218.2 million, other intangible assets of $55.9 million, tangible assets of $68.0 million and assumed liabilities of $18.9 million. The amounts allocated to intangible assets are based on preliminary conclusions resulting from an independent appraisal, which includes an analysis of the business and expected future cash flows.
 
During 2001, the Company completed 12 acquisitions accounted for as purchases. Net cash paid for these acquisitions was $224.8 million, subject to certain adjustments. In addition to cash consideration, the Company issued, in conjunction with two of the acquisitions, approximately 3.1 million unregistered shares of its common stock, valued at approximately $117.0 million. Goodwill recorded in conjunction with the 2001 acquisitions was $285.7 million.
 
During 2000, the Company completed three acquisitions accounted for as purchases. Net cash paid for these acquisitions was $88.8 million, subject to certain adjustments. Goodwill recorded in conjunction with the 2000 acquisitions was $52.0 million.
 
The Company may be required to pay additional cash and common stock consideration for acquisitions up to maximum payments of $243.2 million through 2006, if certain of the acquired entities achieve specific escalating operating income targets. During 2002, cash paid as a result of acquired entities achieving their targets was $39.7 million. Any additional consideration paid will be treated as additional purchase price.
 
3.    Long-term debt
 
The Company has available a $437.0 million unsecured line of credit and commercial paper facility with a group of banks, of which $393.3 million was in use at December 31, 2002, with a weighted average variable interest rate of 2.0%. The credit facilities, which expire in May 2004, consist of a $250.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $187.0 million 364-day revolving credit facility which is renewable annually through 2004.
