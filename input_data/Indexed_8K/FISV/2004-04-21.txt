Fiserv, Inc. (Nasdaq: FISV) announced today record earnings for the first quarter of 2004.
Brookfield, Wisconsin, April 21, 2004
 
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2004, Fiserv processing and services revenues were $840.0 million, a 39% increase over the $604.3 million for the first quarter of 2003. Net income per share-diluted for the first quarter of 2004 was $0.47 per share, compared to $0.38 per share for the first quarter of 2003.
 
"Fiserv had an exceptional first quarter, posting solid growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow," said Leslie M. Muma, President and CEO of Fiserv, Inc. "Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.47, exceeding our expectations. Free cash flow increased 57% over the prior year period to $126.3 million, reflecting our strong financial position. We're on track for a record 2004, with a strong sales pipeline to fuel organic growth and a promising outlook for acquisitions. Our target for full-year diluted earnings is $1.87 to $1.93 per share."
 
Significant client renewals and new relationships signed in the first quarter include the following: Underscoring the technology implications of the federal Check 21 legislation, three clients broadened their relationships with Fiserv to include image-based check processing services. Fiserv significantly expanded its relationship with Hanmi Bank, a $1.7 billion bank in Los Angeles, with an agreement to deliver image-based check processing that will support the bank's acquisition of Pacific Union Bank. Community Credit Union, a $1.6 billion credit union headquartered in Plano, Texas, also added image-based check processing to its services, and Fiserv will provide image-based check processing to First Federal Bank of California, a $4.8 billion bank based in Santa Monica that already relies on Fiserv for many of its technology needs. In addition, Fiserv's RemitStream Solutions unit will supply lockbox services to First Federal.

Additionally, Navy Federal Credit Union, the nation's largest credit union, and Amsouth Bank, a $47 billion bank holding company based in Birmingham, Alabama, both significantly increased their relationships with Fiserv's Integrated Loan Services unit for loan settlement services. The National Bank of Canada signed a $368 million (Canadian) agreement with Fiserv's INTRIA Items joint venture to outsource its check, lockbox and currency processing. Fiserv's partner in INTRIA Items is the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Mexico's Banco Nacional del Ejercito, which provides banking services to the Mexican military services, selected the Fiserv ICBS core banking system to process its 48 branches throughout the country.
 
During the first quarter of 2004, Fiserv completed the acquisition of RegEd, Inc., headquartered in Morrisville, North Carolina, a provider of Internet-based compliance management systems and distance learning programs for the insurance and securities industries. RegEd's line of intelligent on-line products complements the distance learning capabilities that Fiserv offers through its existing Emerald Learning Solutions business.

Free Cash Flow
 
 
Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities before changes in securities processing receivables and payables less capital expenditures including capitalization of software costs for external customers, as reported in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. As the changes in securities processing receivables and payables are generally offset by changes in short-term borrowings and investments, which are included in financing and investing activities, management believes it is more meaningful to analyze changes in operating cash flows before the changes in securities processing receivables and payables. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors because it provides another measure of available cash flow after the Company has satisfied the capital requirements of its operations.
 
Internal Revenue Growth Percentages by Segment
 
 
Internal revenue growth percentages are measured as the increase or decrease in total processing and services revenue for the current period less "acquired revenue from acquisitions" divided by total processing and services revenues from the prior year period plus "acquired revenue from acquisitions." "Acquired revenue from acquisitions" was $159 million ($81 million in the Financial segment and $78 million in the Health segment) for the first quarter and represents pre-acquisition normalized revenue of acquired companies for the comparable prior year period. Internal revenue growth percentage is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors because it provides an alternative to measure revenue growth excluding the impact of acquired revenues.
