News Release
 
 
 
 
Fiserv, Inc. (Nasdaq: FISV) announced today record earnings for the second quarter of 2004.
Brookfield, Wisconsin, July 21, 2004
 
For the three-month period ended June 30, 2004, Fiserv processing and services revenues were $855.9 million, a 33% increase over the $643.9 million for the second quarter of 2003. Net income per share-diluted for the second quarter of 2004 was $0.48 per share, compared to $0.40 per share for the second quarter of 2003.
 
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2004, Fiserv processing and services revenues were $1,695.9 million, a 36% increase over the $1,248.2 million for the first six months of 2003. Net income per share-diluted for the first six months of 2004 was $0.95 per share, compared to $0.78 per share for the first six months of 2003.
 
"Fiserv had an exceptional first half of 2004, posting record revenues, earnings and free cash flow," said Leslie M. Muma, President and CEO of Fiserv, Inc. "Year-to-date free cash flow in 2004 rose to $251.6 million, an increase of 40% over the prior year period. Our focus on operating fundamentals drove our strong earnings and cash flow during the quarter. We accomplished this by operating our businesses in our traditional disciplined manner and integrating our 2003 acquisitions effectively. We're on track for a record year in 2004, with a solid sales pipeline to fuel organic growth and a promising outlook for acquisitions. Our target for full-year diluted earnings per share continues to be $1.87 to $1.93."
 
"Contributing to Fiserv's strong first half was the excellent performance of our health plan management services segment," Muma added. "We believe we are in the right place at the right time as employers continue to look to companies like Fiserv for ways to reduce their health-care costs."

News Release
 
 
 
Free Cash Flow
 
 
Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities before changes in securities processing receivables and payables less capital expenditures including capitalization of software costs for external customers, as reported in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. As the changes in securities processing receivables and payables are generally offset by changes in short-term borrowings and investments, which are included in financing and investing activities, management believes it is more meaningful to analyze changes in operating cash flows before the changes in securities processing receivables and payables. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors because it provides another measure of available cash flow after the Company has satisfied the capital requirements of its operations.
 
Internal Revenue Growth Percentages by Segment
 
 
Internal revenue growth percentages are measured as the increase or decrease in total processing and services revenue for the current period less "acquired revenue from acquisitions" divided by total processing and services revenues from the prior year period plus "acquired revenue from acquisitions." "Acquired revenue from acquisitions" was $288.4 million ($158.9 million in the Financial segment and $129.5 million in the Health segment) for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and represents pre-acquisition normalized revenue of acquired companies for the comparable prior year period. Internal revenue growth percentage is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors because it provides an alternative to measure revenue growth excluding the impact of acquired revenues.
