Fiserv, Inc. (Nasdaq: FISV) announced today continued strong financial results for the third quarter of 2004.
Brookfield, Wisconsin, October 21, 2004
 
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2004, Fiserv processing and services revenues were $866.3 million, a 23% increase over the $702.0 million for the third quarter of 2003. Net income per share-diluted for the third quarter of 2004 was $0.47 per share, compared to $0.41 per share for the third quarter of 2003.
 
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004, Fiserv processing and services revenues were $2,562.2 million, a 31% increase over the $1,950.1 million for the first nine months of 2003. Net income per share-diluted for the first nine months of 2004 was $1.42 per share, compared to $1.19 per share for the first nine months of 2003.
 
"Fiserv posted record revenues, earnings and free cash flow for the first nine months of 2004," said Leslie M. Muma, President and CEO of Fiserv, Inc. "Year-to-date free cash flow in 2004 rose to $395.9 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year period. Our business model that includes high recurring revenue, effective acquisition integration and operating our businesses in our traditional disciplined manner continue to drive strong earnings and cash flows. We also closed two acquisitions in the third quarter and announced another acquisition subsequent to the end of the quarter. We believe we are well positioned for 2005 with a solid sales pipeline to fuel organic growth and a promising outlook for acquisitions. Our target for 2004 full-year diluted earnings per share is $1.90 to $1.92.
 
"Fiserv reached a milestone during the third quarter as we celebrated our 20
th
anniversary," Muma added. "Fiserv was formed in 1984 through the combination of two bank processing organizations. At the time, we had $21 million in revenues, 160 clients, 350 employees and three

locations. Through the efforts of our dedicated employees, we have since grown to $3.5 billion in annual revenues, 15,000 clients and 22,000 employees at over 200 locations. While it is nice to reflect on the results of the past, we are even more excited about the prospects for our next 20 years."

Free Cash Flow
 
 
Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities before changes in securities processing receivables and payables less capital expenditures including capitalization of software costs for external customers, as reported in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. As the changes in securities processing receivables and payables are generally offset by changes in short-term borrowings and investments, which are included in financing and investing activities, management believes it is more meaningful to analyze changes in operating cash flows before the changes in securities processing receivables and payables. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors because it provides another measure of available cash flow after the Company has satisfied the capital requirements of its operations.
 
Internal Revenue Growth Percentages by Segment
 
 
Internal revenue growth percentages are measured as the increase or decrease in total processing and services revenue for the current period less "acquired revenue from acquisitions" divided by total processing and services revenues from the prior year period plus "acquired revenue from acquisitions." "Acquired revenue from acquisitions" was $394.6 million ($202.4 million in the Financial segment and $192.2 million in the Health segment) for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and represents pre-acquisition normalized revenue of acquired companies for the comparable prior year period. Internal revenue growth percentage is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors because it provides an alternative to measure revenue growth excluding the impact of acquired revenues.
