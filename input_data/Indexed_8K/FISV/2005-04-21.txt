Fiserv, Inc. (Nasdaq: FISV) announced today record earnings for the first quarter of 2005.
Brookfield, Wis., April 21, 2005
 
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2005, Fiserv processing and services revenues were $882.3 million, a 9% increase over the $811.6 million for the first quarter of 2004. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations (excluding realized gain from sale of investment of $0.14 per share) for the first quarter of 2005 was $0.58 per share, compared to $0.49 per share for the first quarter of 2004.
 
"We are pleased with our first quarter results which included strong operating earnings and margins across our businesses. We were also pleased to see our financial segment internal revenue growth rate at 5%, as our largest operating segment continues to demonstrate improvement over the prior year. We are projecting 2005 full-year diluted earnings per share (excluding realized gain from sale of investment) of $2.19 to $2.23 per share and for the second quarter $0.53 to $0.55 per share," said Leslie M. Muma, president and chief executive officer of Fiserv.
 
In the first quarter, Fiserv repurchased $106.7 million of its common stock, acquiring 2.8 million shares. This leaves a total of 5.5 million shares available for repurchase under a November 2004 board authorization.
 
"Our management team also completed two significant transactions in the quarter, the signing of a 12-year check processing and image archive agreement with three Australian banks and the completion of our previously announced sale of our securities clearing businesses," said Muma.

Fiserv signed a 12-year agreement to provide check processing and image archive services for Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp. Based on estimated volumes, the agreement will generate projected revenue of $460 million. The transaction will be mildly dilutive to Fiserv's earnings in 2005 by $0.01 to $0.02 per share due to transition expenses and is expected to contribute to earnings in 2006 and beyond. Fiserv began managing operations in six Australian cities on April 18, 2005 for two of the banks, and will begin processing for the third bank in the second half of 2005.
 
On March 24, 2005, Fiserv completed the sale of its securities clearing businesses to Fidelity Global Brokerage Group, Inc. The sales price, paid in cash, was $345 million, which is subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The agreement also provides for a contingent payment of up to $15 million to be paid after the first anniversary of the closing date based on achievement of certain revenue targets. The financial results of Fiserv's securities clearing businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are excluded from reported revenues, cost of revenues and operating cash flows.
 
In addition, this quarter Fiserv completed the acquisition of Del Mar Database, a provider of solutions to automate the back office of mortgage brokers and lenders, as part of its strategy to provide an end-to-end solution to the mortgage industry.
 
Significant client renewals and other new relationships gained in the first quarter include the following: DaimlerChrysler Services North America LLC significantly expanded its relationship with Fiserv's LeMans unit for automotive finance products and services; HomeBanc Mortgage Corp., a mortgage banking company that focuses on originating purchase money residential mortgage loans in the Southeast United States, has contracted to use the MortgageServ loan servicing platform for life-of-loan management; and Baltimore County Savings Bank, a $765 million financial institution in Baltimore, Md., chose Fiserv for a comprehensive package of
