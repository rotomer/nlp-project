EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, the Company uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, including free cash flow, internal revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, to provide investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results. These non-GAAP measures are indicators management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. As an example, the Company uses adjusted earnings per share to present the impact of certain transactions or events that management expects to be infrequently occurring, such as the realized gain on sale of investment occurring in the first quarter of 2005. We believe this adjusted measure is more indicative of the Company's operating performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States.

Free Cash Flow
 
 
Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalization of software costs for external customers, as reported in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors because it provides another measure of available cash flow after the Company has satisfied the capital requirements of its operations.

Outlook for Full Year
 
Based on the strong results through the second quarter, Fiserv is raising its full year 2005 estimated net income per share-diluted earnings (excluding the one time realized gain from sale of investment of $0.14 per share) to a range of $2.24 to $2.28 from a range of $2.19 to $2.23. Fiserv reported net income per share diluted for the first six months of 2005 of $1.17 from continuing operations (excluding the one time realized gain from sale of investment of $0.14 per share.)
 
The net income per share-diluted guidance for the second half of 2005 is lower than the first half of 2005 actual results primarily due to the following factors:

Segment Results
 
The Company's largest operating segment, the financial institution outsourcing, systems and services segment ("Financial"), continued its strong operating performance during the second quarter of 2005 with processing and services revenue growth of 9% and operating income growth of 15% compared to the second quarter of 2004. On a year to date basis, the Financial segment increased processing and services revenues by 7% and operating income by 15% over the prior year period. For the first half of 2005, operating margins in the Financial segment were 26% compared to 24% in the prior year comparable period. Fueling the strong operating margins in the first half of 2005, compared to 2004, were increased software license revenues and higher than normal flood insurance claims processing revenue (both of which generate higher incremental margins), along with continued cost synergies from previously completed product consolidations.
Financial Segment:
 
The internal revenue growth rate for the Financial segment was 7% for the second quarter of 2005 and 6% on a year to date basis, both increasing over the respective prior year comparable periods. The biggest contributors to the increased 2005 internal revenue growth rate in this segment were increased volumes in the lending division's loan settlement services businesses, incremental revenue associated with the newly signed Australian check processing business that began operations in mid-April, continued strong software license revenues and higher than normal revenues associated with one-time flood insurance claims processing.
 
Financial segment revenues, primarily in 2006, will be negatively impacted by approximately $40 million due to changes affecting three client relationships. One client is in the process of being acquired, a second client transitioned from an outsourced solution to license Fiserv software, and a third client plans to convert from an outsourced solution to an in-house solution.
 
Early contract termination fees due to client acquisition by other financial institutions of $7.1 million were recognized in the second quarter of 2005 compared to $5.1 million in the prior year second quarter. On a year to date basis, early contract termination fees were $22.0 million in 2005 compared to $19.4 million in 2004.

News Release
 
 
The Health plan management services segment ("Health") processing and services revenues increased 13% and operating income increased 5% in the second quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and on a year to date basis processing and services revenues increased 15% and operating income increased 12%. The Health segment operating margin, excluding the impact of prescription costs, was 16% in the second quarter of both 2005 and 2004 and on a year to date basis was 18% in 2005 compared to 17% in 2004.
Health Segment:
 
The pro forma internal revenue growth rate, which excludes the positive impact of the prescription cost that is included in revenues and cost of revenues, was 4% in the second quarter and on a year to date basis in 2005. The decrease in the second quarter and year to date 2005 internal revenue growth rates compared to 2004 was primarily due to significant growth of our pharmacy services businesses in early 2004 based on the signing of some very large clients. In addition, growth of the health plan administration businesses has been negatively impacted by increased competition in the large commercial employer market.
 
The Investment support services segment processing and services revenues increased 10% and operating income increased 63% in the second quarter of 2005 and on a year to date basis processing and services revenues increased 9% and operating income increased 51% compared to the prior year periods. Operating income increased in the second quarter of 2005 compared to the prior period due primarily to a temporary increase in cash investment balances that improved net investment income and continued new client growth, especially in the custody and trading services for registered investment advisors.
