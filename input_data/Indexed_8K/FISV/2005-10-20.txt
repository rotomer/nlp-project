Fiserv, Inc. (Nasdaq: FISV) announced today strong earnings for the third quarter of 2005.
Brookfield, Wis., October 20, 2005
 
Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2005 was $0.58 per share, compared to $0.53 per share for the third quarter of 2004. Processing and services revenues were $925.3 million, an increase of 10% over the third quarter of 2004.
 
For the nine month period ended September 30, 2005, Fiserv processing and services revenues were $2.7 billion, a 10% increase over the first nine months of 2004. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations (excluding realized gain from sale of investment of $0.14 per share) was $1.74 per share compared to $1.50 per share for the first nine months of 2004.
 
"We are very pleased with our third quarter results and we are forecasting full year 2005 earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.28 to $2.31 (excluding $0.14 per share from a realized gain from sale of investment).

News Release
 
 
 
Fiserv repurchased 4.4 million shares of its common stock in the third quarter of 2005 and a total of 10.8 million shares in 2005. The Company has 7.4 million shares authorized for repurchase at September 30, 2005 under the current stock buy back plan.
 
OUTLOOK FOR THE FULL YEAR
 
Fiserv has updated its earnings and revenue outlook for the full year. For the full year of 2005, processing and services revenues are estimated to be approximately $3.66 billion to $3.68 billion ($940 to $960 million for the fourth quarter) and net income per share-diluted from continuing operations is estimated to be $2.28 to $2.31 per share (excluding realized gain from sale of investment of $0.14 per share) ($0.54 to $0.57 per share for the fourth quarter). These estimates for the full year exclude any positive earnings associated with the anticipated receipt of a large contract termination fee from a client being acquired by another financial institution. Internal revenue growth rates for the full year 2005 are projected to be in the mid-single digits in the Financial and Investment segments and low double digits in the Health segment.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, the Company uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, including free cash flow, internal revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, to provide investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results. These non-GAAP measures are indicators management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. As an example, the Company uses adjusted earnings per share to present the impact of certain transactions or events that management expects to be infrequently occurring, such as the realized gain on sale of investment occurring in the first quarter of 2005. The Company believes this adjusted measure is more indicative of the Company's operating performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States.

Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalization of software costs for external customers, as reported in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors because it provides another measure of available cash flow after the Company has satisfied the capital requirements of its operations.
 
 
 
The securities clearing businesses, sold on March 24, 2005, are not included in the segment results.

Included in the Financial segment results are early contract termination and assignment fees of $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared to $12.3 million for the comparable period in 2004 and $26.4 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2005 compared to $31.8 million for the comparable period in 2004. These clients were acquired by other financial institutions and represent a small portion of Fiserv's more than 6,000 core financial institution processing clients. This segment's businesses generally enter into three to five-year contracts with its clients that contain early contract termination fees. These fees are very unpredictable and can vary significantly from period to period based on the number of terminated contracts and how early in the contract term a contract is terminated. The Financial segment's early contract termination fees were $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Internal revenue growth percentages are measured as the increase in total processing and services revenue for the current period less "acquired revenue from acquisitions" divided by total processing and services revenues from the prior year period plus "acquired revenue from acquisitions." "Acquired revenue from acquisitions" was $20.8 million ($13.7 million in the Financial segment and $7.1 million in the Health segment) for the third quarter of 2005 and $44.7 million ($26.7 million in the Financial segment and $18.0 million in the Health segment) for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and represents pre-acquisition normalized revenue of acquired companies, less dispositions, for the comparable prior year period. The securities clearing businesses, sold on March 24, 2005, are not included in the internal revenue growth percentages by segment.
(1)
 
The pro forma internal revenue growth percentages exclude the positive impact of the prescription cost which is included in both revenues and cost of revenues in the Health segment.
(2)
 
Actual and pro forma internal revenue growth percentages are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company believes are useful to investors because they provide a breakdown of internal and acquisition-related revenue growth including and excluding prescription costs in revenue.

Segment Results
 
: The Company's largest operating segment, the financial institution outsourcing, systems and services segment ("Financial"), continued its strong operating performance during the third quarter of 2005 with processing and services revenue growth of 8% compared to the third quarter of 2004 and an operating margin of 23%. The third quarter 2005 operating margin of 23% decreased from 25% in the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to lower software license sales, increased product development costs in the Company's lending businesses, additional costs related to ramping up the Australian item processing contract and reduced termination fees. On a year to date basis, the Financial segment increased processing and services revenues by 8% and operating income by 9% over the prior year period and operating margins were 25% compared to 24% in 2004.
Financial Segment
 
The internal revenue growth rate for the Financial segment was 5% for the third quarter of 2005 and 6% on a year to date basis, both increasing over the respective prior year comparable periods. The third quarter 2005 internal revenue growth rate of 5% was negatively impacted by approximately 1% due to lower termination fees than 2004. The largest contributors to the increased 2005 year to date internal revenue growth rate in this segment were increased volumes and new clients in the lending division's loan settlement services businesses, incremental revenue associated with the Australian check processing business that began operations in mid-April, strong software license revenues in the first half of 2005 and higher than normal revenues associated with flood insurance claims processing in the first half of 2005.

: The Health plan management services segment ("Health") processing and services revenues increased 15% in both the third quarter and on a year to date basis in 2005 compared to 2004. The Health segment operating margin, excluding the impact of prescription costs, was 17%, on a year to date basis, in both 2005 and 2004.
Health Segment
 
The pro forma internal revenue growth rate, which excludes the positive impact of the prescription cost that is included in revenues and cost of revenues, was 3% in the third quarter of 2005 and on a year to date basis was 4%. The decrease in the third quarter and year to date 2005 internal revenue growth rates compared to 2004 was primarily due to significant growth of our pharmacy services businesses in early 2004 due to the signing of some very large clients. In addition, growth of the health plan administration businesses has been negatively impacted by increased competition in the large commercial employer market.
 
: The Investment support services segment processing and services revenues and operating income both increased 5% in the third quarter of 2005 and on a year to date basis processing and services revenues increased 8% and operating income increased 34% compared to the prior year periods. Operating income increased for the nine-months ended September 30, 2005 compared to the prior period due primarily to a temporary increase in cash investment balances, in April and May 2005, that improved net investment income in the second quarter and continued new client growth, especially in the custody and trading services for registered investment advisors.
