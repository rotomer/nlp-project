Fiserv, Inc. (Nasdaq: FISV) today reported record revenues and earnings for 2005. Processing and services revenues for the full year increased 11% to $3.71 billion compared to $3.35 billion in 2004. Full-year earnings per share were $2.70 and earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.68. Full-year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.30 (which excludes $0.29 per share related to realized gains from sale of investments and $0.09 per share for receipt of a large contract termination fee) versus $2.00 in 2004.
Brookfield, Wis., Jan. 30, 2006
 
Revenues for the quarter increased 14% to $987.7 million (which includes a large contract termination fee received of $26.3 million) compared to $866.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $0.81 and earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.80. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.56 (excluding $0.15 per share related to a realized gain from sale of investment and $0.09 per share for the large contract termination fee), compared to $0.50 for the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
"I am pleased with our strong fourth quarter, which led to record results for the full year. Each of our business segments delivered revenue growth led by strong organic growth in our financial institutions area," said Jeff Yabuki, president and chief executive officer of Fiserv. "In addition to delivering strong results in 2005, we continued to make investments that will enhance the long-term strength of the Company."

"We broadened our capabilities and reach in the electronic bill payments space through our acquisition of BillMatrix; increased our global presence by establishing Fiserv Global Services; solidified our technology leadership in the lending business through a unique, end-to-end, electronic mortgage processing solution; and introduced the Fiserv Clearing Network which allows members the ability to clear checks electronically, and more efficiently, under Check 21. In 2006, we announced the acquisition of CareGain which provides us with a differentiated healthcare technology solution to support the strong growth occurring in consumer-driven health plans through a focus on health savings and health reimbursement accounts," Yabuki said.
 
Fiserv repurchased 4.4 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a total of 15.2 million shares in 2005. The Company had 3.1 million shares authorized for repurchase at December 31, 2005 under the current stock buy back plan.
 
OUTLOOK FOR 2006
 
For 2006, Fiserv expects full-year earnings to be within a range of $2.46 to $2.53 per share (which includes the effect of incremental share-based compensation expense which is estimated to be $0.09 to $0.11 per share). The 2005 pro forma effect of incremental share-based compensation expense would have reduced adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.11 per share from $2.30 to $2.19 per share. The incremental share-based compensation expense is a result of the Company adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R on January 1, 2006. We project internal revenue growth rates in 2006 to be in the mid-single digits for the Financial and Investment segments and low double digits in the Health segment.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, the Company uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, including free cash flow, internal revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, to provide investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results. These non-GAAP measures are indicators management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. As an example, the Company uses adjusted earnings per share to present the impact of certain transactions or events that management expects to be infrequently occurring, such as the

realized gain on sale of investment occurring in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company believes this adjusted measure is more indicative of the Company's operating performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States.

Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalization of software costs for external customers, as reported in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors because it provides another measure of available cash flow after the Company has satisfied the capital requirements of its operations.

Segment Results
 
The Company's largest operating segment, the financial institution outsourcing, systems and services segment ("Financial"), continued its strong operating performance during the fourth quarter of 2005 with processing and services revenue of $688.2 million and an operating margin of 25%. Revenues and operating income in the fourth quarter of 2005 were positively impacted by a large contract termination fee of $26.3 million. The operating margin of 25% in the fourth quarter of 2005 was positively impacted by 3 percentage points due to the large contract termination fee. For full year 2005, the Financial segment increased revenues by 10% over the prior year and operating margins were 25% compared to 24% in 2004.
Financial Segment:
 
The pro forma internal revenue growth rate for the Financial segment, which excludes the large contract termination fee in the fourth quarter, was 7% for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 6% for 2005, both increasing over the respective prior year comparable periods. The largest contributors to the 2005 full year pro forma internal revenue growth rate in this segment were increased volumes and new clients in the lending division's loan settlement services and loan servicing businesses, increased revenue associated with new client growth and cross sales in our bank and credit union operations, incremental revenue associated with the Australian check processing business that began operations in mid-April and higher than normal revenues associated with flood insurance claims processing.
 
The Health plan management services segment ("Health") revenues increased 12% in the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year of 2005 compared to 2004. The Health segment operating margin was 8% in 2005.

News Release
 
 
The pro forma internal revenue growth rate, which excludes the positive impact of the prescription cost that is included in revenues and cost of revenues, was 3% for the full year of 2005. The decrease in the actual fourth quarter and 2005 internal revenue growth rates compared to 2004 was primarily due to significant growth of our pharmacy services businesses in early 2004 due to the signing of some very large clients. In addition, growth of the health plan administration businesses has been negatively impacted by competition in the large commercial employer market.
 
The Investment support services segment revenues increased 6% in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004 and had an operating margin of 17% in the fourth quarter of 2005. Revenues increased 7% in 2005 compared to the prior year and the operating margin was 19%. Operating income increased for the year compared to the prior year due primarily to a temporary increase in cash investment balances, in April and May 2005, that improved net investment income in the second quarter and continued new client growth, especially in the custody and trading services for registered investment advisors.
Investment Segment:
 
Realized Gain on Sale of Investment
 
On October 31, 2005, Fiserv sold its investment in INTRIA Items, Inc., to its partner Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) recognizing a pre-tax gain of $43.4 million, or $0.15 per share, subject to post-closing adjustments. INTRIA provides a comprehensive suite of check, lockbox and currency processing services to CIBC and other financial institutions. CIBC decided to purchase Fiserv's share as part of its ongoing reorganization of the bank's Canadian retail network and supporting back-office operations.
