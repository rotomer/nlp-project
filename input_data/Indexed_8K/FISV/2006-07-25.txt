Brookfield, Wis., July 25, 2006
For the six months ended June 30, 2006, total revenues increased 11 percent to $2,189.9 million compared to $1,969.5 million in 2005. Earnings per share for the first six months of 2006 and 2005 were $1.30.

"Earnings for the quarter exceeded our expectations after an exceptionally strong first quarter," said Jeff Yabuki, president and chief executive officer of Fiserv.

year and are well ahead of the prior year. That performance, in combination with especially strong sales activity in last year's fourth quarter, positions us to deliver solid organic revenue growth in the second half of 2006 and into 2007," said Yabuki.

News Release
At the start of the third quarter, Fiserv announced the acquisition of The Jerome Group LLC, a full-service direct marketing firm and digital print provider, to enhance Fiserv's Output Solutions division's ability to help clients build loyalty and drive new revenues.
OUTLOOK FOR 2006
The company increased its full-year 2006 continuing operations earnings estimate to be within a range of $2.48 to $2.54 per share. Fiserv's previous guidance was $2.46 to $2.53 per share. The primary reason for the change is a one-time tax benefit realized in the second quarter of $3.1 million, or $0.02 per share, which is related to a change in a state tax law during the quarter. The company's effective income tax rate for the second half of 2006 is estimated to be 38.5 percent.
The company also reaffirmed its 2006 adjusted internal revenue growth rates (excluding customer reimbursements and prescription product revenues) to be in the mid-single digits for the Financial and Investment segments and low to mid-single digits in the Health segment.
ACCOUNTING CHANGE
On January 1, 2006, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R") that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock purchase plans, stock option grants and similar awards. The company adopted SFAS 123R under the modified prospective method, which requires the application of SFAS 123R in 2006 to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of outstanding awards for which service had not been rendered (such as unvested options) that were outstanding as of January 1, 2006 shall be recognized as the remaining services are rendered.
Share-based compensation expense for the second quarter of 2006 was $5.5 million, or $0.02 per share, and for the six month period ended June 30, 2006 was $19.3 million, or $0.07 per share. Share-based compensation expense is estimated to be approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share per quarter for the remainder of 2006 with a full year impact of $0.09 to $0.11 per share.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, the company uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, including free cash flow, internal revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, to provide investors a more complete understanding of the company's underlying operational results. These non-GAAP measures are indicators management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. As an example, the company uses adjusted earnings per share to present the impact of certain transactions or events that management expects to occur infrequently, such as the realized gain on sale of investment occurring in the six-month period ended June 30, 2005. The company believes this adjusted measure is more indicative of the company's operating performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States.

News Release
 
Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that the company believes is useful to investors because it provides more visibility and insight into how management views the underlying operating performance of the company. Management excludes the impact of pass through customer reimbursements and prescription product costs that must be presented in revenue under GAAP and includes the pro forma share-based compensation expense impact for the disclosed periods in 2005 due to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006.

News Release
 
Actual and adjusted internal revenue growth percentages are non-GAAP financial measures that the company believes are useful to investors because they present internal revenue growth both including and excluding customer reimbursements and prescription product costs that must be presented in revenue under GAAP.
 
Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalization of software costs for external customers, as reported in the company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the company believes is useful to investors because it measures cash flow after the company has satisfied the capital requirements of its operations.

Segment Results
Financial Segment:
The company's largest operating segment continued 2006 with solid performance in the second quarter. Revenues were $768 million for the quarter with operating income of $159 million. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes customer reimbursements, continued to be strong at 23.7 percent for the quarter compared to 24.5 percent in the first quarter of 2006. The decline in adjusted operating margin was primarily attributable to a decrease of $28.3 million in flood claims processing revenue. Flood claims processing revenue was $30.3 million in the first quarter and $2.0 million in the second quarter. Partially offsetting this negative margin impact in the quarter were increased software revenues and a reduction in share-based compensation expense compared to the first quarter. Year-to-date adjusted operating margins in 2006 and 2005 were 24.1 percent and 24.2 percent, respectively.
The year-to-date 2006 adjusted organic revenue growth rate was 6 percent in 2006 and 2005 consistent with the company's annual guidance of mid-single digits for the segment. Positive contributors to the organic growth rate in 2006 were increased volumes and new clients in the lending division's loan settlement services businesses, new client growth and increased product sales of the company's Information Technology, Inc.'s banking products and continued solid growth in the credit union businesses. Partially offsetting this growth was an approximate 210 basis point negative impact due to the loss of a few large client relationships announced in 2005 and the negative impact of reduced contract termination fees in 2006 compared to 2005. As expected, the second quarter adjusted organic revenue growth rate of 3 percent declined from the first quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the acceleration in flood claims processing in the first quarter, which positively impacted the segment's first quarter organic growth rate by approximately 300 basis points, and also, the anniversary of the Australian check processing revenue near the end of the first quarter of 2006.

News Release
Health Segment:
The Health segment revenues were $289 million for the quarter with operating income of $18 million. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes prescription product costs and customer reimbursements, was 14.4 percent for the quarter compared to 16.5 percent in the first quarter of 2006. Year-to-date adjusted operating margins were 15.5 percent in 2006 compared to 17.1 percent in 2005. The decrease in the year-to-date 2006 adjusted operating margin compared to 2005 was primarily due to $2.5 million of incremental investments in areas such as the company's consumer-directed health care initiatives. These investments are expected to continue through the remainder of 2006.
The Health segment results in the second half of 2006 should be positively impacted by the signing of the three large agreements in the pharmacy services businesses along with margin improvement in the health plan administration business. The health plan administration business is implementing operational enhancements, which are expected to provide annualized expense savings of approximately $6 to $12 million. This expense improvement initiative is in its early stages and will be completed by mid-2007.
Investment Segment:
The Investment segment revenues were $36 million for the quarter with operating income of $8 million. Adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 21.3 percent compared to 17.6 percent in the first quarter. This increase was primarily due to increased plan fee revenue and investment income in the second quarter.
