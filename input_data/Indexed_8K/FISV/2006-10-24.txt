OUTLOOK FOR 2006
The company updated its full-year 2006 continuing operations earnings estimate to be within a range of $2.51 to $2.54 per share, from its previously communicated guidance of $2.48 to $2.54 per share. The company anticipates its 2006 adjusted internal revenue growth rates (excluding customer reimbursements and prescription product revenues) will be in the mid-single digits for the Financial and Investment segments and low single digits in the Health segment.
ACCOUNTING CHANGE
On Jan. 1, 2006, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which requires companies to expense the value of employee stock purchase plans, stock option grants and similar awards. The company adopted SFAS 123R under the modified prospective method, which requires the application of SFAS 123R in 2006 to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of outstanding awards for which service had not been rendered (such as unvested options) that were outstanding as of Jan. 1, 2006 will be recognized as the remaining services are rendered.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, including "free cash flow," "internal revenue growth," "adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," and "adjusted earnings per share," to provide investors a more complete understanding of the company's underlying operational results. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. As an example, the company uses adjusted earnings per share to present the impact of certain transactions or events that management expects to occur infrequently, such as the realized gain on sale of investment occurring in the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, 2005. The company believes this adjusted measure is more indicative of the company's operating performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States.

Adjusted operating income and margin are non-GAAP financial measures that the company believes are useful to investors because they provide more insight into how management views the underlying operating performance of the company. Management excludes the impact of pass-through customer reimbursements and prescription product costs that must be presented in revenue and expenses under GAAP and includes the pro forma share-based compensation expense impact for the disclosed periods in 2005 due to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006.

Actual and adjusted internal revenue growth percentages are non-GAAP financial measures that the company believes are useful to investors because they present internal revenue growth both including and excluding customer reimbursements and prescription product costs that must be presented in revenue under GAAP.
 
Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalization of software costs for external customers, as reported in the company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the company believes is useful to investors because it measures cash flow after the company has satisfied the capital requirements of its operations.

Segment Results
Financial Segment:
The company's largest operating segment continued 2006 with strong third quarter performance. The segment generated revenues of $788 million for the quarter with operating income of $165 million, compared with adjusted operating income in 2005 of $142 million, a 16.2 percent increase. Adjusted operating margin continued to be strong at 23.9 percent for the quarter compared with 22.4 percent in the third quarter of 2005. The increase in adjusted operating margin of 150 basis points in the third quarter of 2006 compared with 2005 was due primarily to an increase in higher-margin revenues in the company's payments businesses, continued strong results in core bank processing, and some improvements in operating efficiencies. Year-to-date adjusted operating margins in 2006 and 2005 were 24.0 percent and 23.6 percent, respectively.
Year-to-date adjusted internal revenue growth was 6 percent in both 2006 and 2005, consistent with the company's annual guidance of mid-single digits for the segment. Contributing positively to the internal growth rate in 2006 were increased volume and new clients in loan settlement services within the Lending division; new client growth and increased sales of banking, credit union, and payment products and services; and continued solid growth in card fulfillment and print services within the Output Solutions division.
Health Segment:
Health segment revenues were $335 million for the quarter with operating income of $15 million. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 390 basis points to 12.6 percent as compared to 16.5 percent in the third quarter of 2005. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was 14.5 percent in 2006 compared with 16.9 percent in 2005. For the quarter, adjusted operating margin was negatively impacted by incremental investments of $4 million in several growth areas, which include the company's consumer-directed health care initiatives. The incremental investments negatively impacted adjusted operating margin in the third quarter of

2006 by approximately 340 basis points. For the first nine months of 2006, the incremental investments were $6.5 million, which negatively impacted adjusted operating margin by approximately 180 basis points. These investments are expected to continue through the end of 2006.
The health plan administration business continued to implement operational enhancements, which are expected to provide, on an annualized basis, expense savings in the range of $6 million to $12 million. The segment will experience some limited incremental benefit from these expense savings in the fourth quarter of 2006 and should be fully implemented by the middle of 2007.
