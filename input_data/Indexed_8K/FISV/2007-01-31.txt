For immediate release:
Jan. 31, 2007
Fiserv, Inc. (Nasdaq: FISV), a leading provider of information management systems and services, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2006. Total revenues increased 11% to $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter and were up 12% to $4.5 billion for the full year 2006.
Brookfield, Wis., Jan. 31, 2007
Earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year were $0.61 and $2.53, respectively, for 2006, and were $0.81 and $2.70, respectively, for 2005. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 19% to $0.64. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 16% to $2.53.
"Our fourth quarter results were consistent with our expectations and capped a strong year for the Company," said Jeff Yabuki, president and chief executive officer of Fiserv. "In 2006, we delivered solid financial results, improved operating margins, and returned $560 million to our shareholders over the course of the year through our share buyback plan.

"In addition, we made progress against our long-term strategic priorities, which will better position us to increase value, opportunity and growth for our stakeholders," Yabuki added. "As the client-centric initiatives of Fiserv 2.0 take hold, we will begin to realize the incremental growth and stronger financial performance that underpin our long-term plans."
BOARD APPROVES NEW SHARE BUYBACK AUTHORIZATION
Fiserv announced today that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 10 million shares of its common stock. Under this new authorization, which does not expire, Fiserv may repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management, subject to its assessment of market conditions and other factors. The company expects to hold common stock acquired through the program for issuance in connection with acquisitions or pursuant to Fiserv's equity plans and for other corporate purposes. Fiserv has completed its repurchase activity from previous authorizations.
"In addition to investing internally and pursuing high-quality acquisitions, we will continue to utilize share repurchase as an important element of our plan to deliver long-term value for shareholders," said Yabuki.
INSURANCE AND HEALTH BUSINESSES FORM A NEW REPORTING SEGMENT
Fiserv re-aligned its reporting segments based on organizational changes announced in the fourth quarter. The newly created Insurance Services (Insurance) segment includes the insurance businesses that provide a broad array of technology solutions primarily for life insurance and property and casualty insurance companies. These businesses had previously been part of the Financial Institution Services (Financial) segment. Additionally, the new segment includes the businesses which comprised the former Health Plan Management Services (Health) segment.

"An important objective of our long-term strategy is to bring high-value solutions to the broad-based insurance market," said Yabuki. "Our new organization approach is to provide integrated, technology-based solutions to each of the three main areas of the insurance industry  health, life, and property and casualty. We are uniquely suited to deliver comprehensive and market-leading value to the entire insurance industry."
In connection with this change, the company has provided a two-year historical re-classification of financial information by reporting segment, along with separately noted fourth quarter results for the former Health segment. (See pages 14-16 for details.)

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, including "free cash flow," "adjusted internal revenue growth," "adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," and "adjusted earnings per share," to provide investors a more complete understanding of the company's underlying operational results. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful

comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. As an example, the company uses adjusted earnings per share to present the impact of certain transactions or events that management expects to occur infrequently, such as the realized gain on sale of investment occurring in 2005. The company believes these adjusted measures are more indicative of the company's operating performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States.

Free cash flow is measured as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures including capitalization of software costs for external customers, as reported in the company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the company believes is useful to investors because it measures cash flow after the company has satisfied the capital requirements of its operations.

Adjusted operating income and margin are non-GAAP financial measures that the company believes are useful to investors because they provide more insight into how management views the underlying operating performance of the company and presents the impact of certain transactions or events that management expects to occur infrequently, or to adjust for items in order to provide meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-year reported results. In analyzing the company's performance, management excludes the impact of pass-through customer reimbursements and prescription product costs that must be presented in revenue and expenses under GAAP and includes the pro forma share-based compensation expense impact in 2005 due to the prospective adoption of SFAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006.

Actual and adjusted internal revenue growth percentages are non-GAAP financial measures that the company believes are useful to investors because they present internal revenue growth both including and excluding one large contract termination fee, as well as customer reimbursements and prescription product costs that must be presented in revenue under GAAP.

Segment Results
Financial Segment
The company's largest operating segment generated revenues of $748 million for the quarter with adjusted operating income of $150 million. Adjusted operating margin continued to be strong at 23.6 percent for the quarter compared with 21.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with 2005 was due primarily to an increase in higher-margin revenues in the company's payments businesses, continued strong operating results in core bank and credit union processing, and overall operating efficiencies. These items were partially offset by weaker results in the company's lending division. Adjusted operating margins for the full year 2006 and 2005 were 23.2 percent and 23.1 percent, respectively.
Adjusted internal revenue growth was 5 percent for the quarter. For the full year, adjusted internal revenue growth was consistent with expectations at 6 percent as compared with 7 percent in 2005. Contributing positively to the internal revenue growth rate in 2006 were increased sales of banking, credit union, loan settlement services, and payment products and services; and continued solid growth in card fulfillment and print services within the output solutions division.
Insurance Segment
Insurance segment revenues were $416 million for the quarter, and generated operating income of $34 million. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 17.8 percent compared with 19.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter compared with 2005 was negatively impacted by lower flood claim processing revenue and incremental investments in the company's consumer-directed health care initiatives, partially offset by stronger margins in the company's health and property and casualty insurance processing businesses. Full-year adjusted operating margin was 20.1 percent compared with 18.7 percent in 2005. The increase in 2006 adjusted operating margin compared with 2005 was

due primarily to higher operating margins in the company's flood and property and casualty insurance processing businesses, partially offset by continued investment primarily in its consumer-directed health care initiatives.
Adjusted internal revenues declined in the insurance segment by 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with the fourth quarter of 2005. For the fourth quarter of 2005, adjusted internal revenue growth was flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. The flood processing business negatively impacted adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment by 9 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2006. This was due primarily to the significant reduction in flood claims processing revenue from $15.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding the decrease in the flood processing business, the fourth quarter adjusted internal revenue growth rate for the segment would have been 4 percent.
