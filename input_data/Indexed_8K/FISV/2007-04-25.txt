For immediate release:
April 25, 2007
Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), a leading provider of technology solutions, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2007. Total revenues for the quarter increased 11% to $1.22 billion compared with $1.10 billion in 2006. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.66 compared with $0.64 in 2006.
Brookfield, Wis., April 25, 2007
The Financial Institution Services segment produced very strong internal revenue growth and operating margin performance in the first quarter. Internal revenue growth was 7% for the quarter, and segment adjusted operating margin was up more than 300 basis points to 24.8%. Almost all of the first quarter increase in operating income in this segment was generated through a combination of growth in higher-margin internal revenues and operating efficiencies.
"Our overall results for the quarter were consistent with our expectations, led by strong revenue growth and operating margin performance in our financial segment," said Jeffery Yabuki, president and chief executive officer of Fiserv. "Our business model of providing clients with highly valued products and services through a privileged relationship continues to show strength.
"We made tangible progress against our Fiserv 2.0 initiatives in a quarter where we also generated solid cash flow, returning $142 million to shareholders through our share re-purchase program," Yabuki added.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, including "free cash flow," "adjusted internal revenue growth," and "adjusted operating margin," to provide investors a more complete understanding of the company's underlying operational results. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. The company believes these adjusted measures are more indicative of the company's operating performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States.

Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that the company believes is useful to investors because it provides more insight into how management views the underlying operating performance of the company. In analyzing the company's performance, management excludes the impact of pass-through customer reimbursements and prescription product costs that must be presented in revenue and expenses under GAAP.

Actual and adjusted internal revenue growth percentages are non-GAAP financial measures that the company believes are useful to investors because they present internal revenue growth both including and excluding customer reimbursements and prescription product costs that must be presented in revenue under GAAP. In addition, we believe that the presentation of our adjusted internal revenue growth rate both including and excluding flood claims processing revenue is useful to investors because it enables them to understand the impact of these revenues, which can significantly impact our internal revenue growth rate.
Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow is measured as net income plus share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures, plus or minus changes in working capital-net as reported in the company's condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that the company believes is useful to investors because it measures the company's cash flow after it has satisfied the capital requirements of its operations.

SEGMENT RESULTS
Financial Segment
The company's largest operating segment generated revenues of $767.3 million for the first quarter, an increase of 9.6 percent compared with 2006. Adjusted internal revenue growth was 7 percent for the quarter. Driving the internal revenue growth rate in 2007 were increased sales of the company's banking and payment products and services to existing and new clients, as well as growth within the output solutions division. The financial segment's adjusted internal revenue growth rate was at least 4% for the tenth straight quarter.
Financial segment operating income increased $29.8 million to $159.9 million, up 22.9 percent compared with the first quarter of 2006. The operating income increase was due primarily to growth in higher-margin internal revenues and operating efficiencies in the company's depository institution and payment processing businesses. Adjusted operating margin accelerated to 24.8 percent for the quarter compared with 21.7 percent in the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 310 basis points.
Insurance Segment
Insurance segment revenues were $417.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 15.2 percent compared with the first quarter of 2006. Adjusted internal revenues in the insurance segment declined by 14 percent in the first quarter of 2007. This decline was driven by a $29.7 million year-over-year reduction in flood claims processing revenue, from $30.3 million in the first quarter of 2006 to $0.6 million in the current quarter. This reduction in flood claims revenue negatively impacted first quarter 2007 adjusted internal revenue growth by 13 percentage points. Excluding flood claim processing revenues, first quarter adjusted internal revenue for the segment declined by 1 percent in 2007. The revenue decline was due primarily to continuing competitive pressure in the large national accounts client segment of the health plan management businesses and weakness in the property and casualty insurance software license business.

News Release        
 
Insurance segment first quarter 2007 operating income was $27.9 million, compared with $56.7 million in the first quarter of 2006. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down to 14.4 percent, compared with 27.6 percent in the first quarter of 2006. The major items negatively impacting 2007 operating income and margins compared with 2006 were the significant decrease in higher-margin flood claim processing revenue and continuing investments in the consumer directed and business process outsourcing businesses. These items were partially offset by improvements in operating efficiency in the health plan administration businesses.
