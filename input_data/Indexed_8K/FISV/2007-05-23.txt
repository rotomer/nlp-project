At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Fiserv, Inc. (the "Company") on May 23, 2007 (the "Annual Meeting"), the shareholders of the Company approved the Fiserv, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). A copy of the Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Under the terms of the Plan, the Company may make grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalent units, incentive cash awards and other equity-based awards to its employees, officers and directors. The Plan provides that 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock are reserved for issuance under the Plan. The Plan is described in detail in the Company's definitive proxy statement for the Annual Meeting. Because awards under the Plan to the Company's executive officers will be made in the future at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors, the Company currently cannot determine the amounts payable to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer or named executive officers.
Forms of the restricted stock agreements and stock option agreements that the Company may use to make grants under the Plan are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2-10.5 and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
At the Annual Meeting, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to allow its by-laws to provide for a majority voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections. On May 23, 2007, the Company filed the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation (the "Amendment") with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions and, shortly thereafter, filed Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Restated Articles"). The Amendment and the Restated Articles are filed herewith as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
Also on May 23, 2007, effective as of the filing of the Amendment, the Company amended and restated its by-laws. The by-laws now provide that each director will be elected by the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at any meeting of shareholders for the election of directors, other than a contested election. A majority of the votes cast will mean that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "withheld" with respect to that director's election. In a contested election, each director will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at the meeting.
The by-laws further provide that, in an uncontested election of directors, any nominee for director who is already serving as a director and receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election (a "Majority Against Vote") will promptly tender his or her resignation. The nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors will then promptly consider the resignation submitted by a director receiving a Majority Against Vote, and the committee will recommend to the board whether to accept the tendered resignation or reject it.
The board of directors will act on the committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the shareholders' meeting where the election occurred. In considering the committee's recommendation, the board will consider the factors considered by the committee and such additional information and factors the board believes to be relevant. Following the board's decision, the Company will promptly file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission that sets forth the board's decision whether to accept the resignation as tendered, including a full explanation of the process by which the decision was reached, and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation.
Any director who tenders a resignation pursuant to this provision will not participate in the committee recommendation or the board consideration regarding whether to accept the tendered resignation. The by-laws also set forth a procedure for acting if a majority of the members of the committee receive Majority Against Votes at the same election.
The Amended and Restated By-laws are filed herewith as Exhibit 3.3, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The name of the corporation is Fiserv, Inc.
The Corporation is incorporated under the provisions of Chapter 180 of the Wisconsin Statutes.
The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 475,000,000 shares, of which 450,000,000 shares shall be designated Common Stock, having a par value of $.01 per share; and 25,000,000 shares shall be designated as Preferred Stock, having no par value per share. Authority is hereby vested in the Board of Directors from time to time to issue the Preferred Stock as Preferred Stock in one or more series of any number of shares and, in connection with the creation of such series, to fix, by resolution providing for the use of shares thereof, the voting rights, if any; the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of such series in respect to the rate of dividend, the price, the terms and conditions of redemption; the amounts payable upon such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation; sinking fund provisions for the redemption or purchase of such series of shares; and, if the shares of any series are issued with the privilege of conversation, the terms and conditions on which such series of shares may be converted. In addition to the foregoing, to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by Wisconsin law, in connection with each issue thereof, the Board of Directors may at its discretion assign to any series of the Preferred Stock such other terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations, rights and privileges as it may deem appropriate. The aggregate number of preferred shares issued and not cancelled of any and all preferred series shall not exceed the total number of shares of Preferred Stock hereinabove authorized. Each series of Preferred Stock shall be distinctively designated by letter or descriptive words or both.
Section 1. . There is designated a series of Preferred Stock titled as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock," no par value per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), and the authorized number of shares constituting the Series A Preferred Stock shall be 3,000,000. Such number of authorized shares may be increased or decreased, from time to time, by resolution of the Board, provided, however, that no such decrease shall reduce the number of authorized shares of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, plus the number of such shares then reserved for issuance upon the exercise of any outstanding options, warrants or rights or the exercise of any conversion or exchange privilege contained in any outstanding security issued by the Corporation.

Section 2. .
Dividends and Distributions
(A) Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock (or shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation) ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of Common Stock and of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available therefor, such dividends, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock. In the event the Company shall at any time after February 23, 1998 (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) The Board shall declare, out of funds legally available therefor, a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock, as provided in paragraph (A) of the Section 2, immediately after it has declared a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock).
Section 3. . In addition to any other voting rights required by applicable law, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
(A) Each share of the Series A Preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation. The multiple of 100 (the "Voting Multiple") set forth in the preceding sentence shall be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided in this paragraph (A). In the event that the Corporation shall at any time after the effective date of this Resolution of the Board ("Resolution") (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then, in each case, the Voting Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the number of votes per share to which the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled shall be the Voting Multiple in effect immediately prior to such even multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided in the Resolution, in any other resolution establishing another series of Preferred Stock (or any series of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation) or by applicable law, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of the Common Stock and the holders of any class of capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation.
(C) Except as otherwise provided in the Resolution or by applicable law, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent provided in paragraph (B) of the Section 3 for the taking of any corporate action.

(iv) Purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock or any shares of any class of capital stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation) with the Series A Preferred Stock, or redeem any shares of such parity stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication to the holders of all such shares upon such terms and conditions as the Board, after taking into consideration the respective annual dividend rates and the other relative powers, preferences and rights of the respective series and classes of such shares, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective holders of shares of all such series and classes.
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of any class of capital stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.

Section 1

. . The annual meeting of shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") shall be held on such date and at such place as may be fixed by the Board of Directors. In fixing a meeting date for any Annual Meeting, the Board of Directors may consider such factors as it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of its business judgment. At each Annual Meeting, the shareholders shall elect individuals to the Board of Directors in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Corporation.

The President shall call a Special Meeting upon the demand, in accordance with this Section 3, of the holders of record representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting.
(b) To enable the Corporation to determine the shareholders entitled to demand a Special Meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date to determine the
 
shareholders entitled to make such a demand (the "Demand Record Date"). The Demand Record Date shall not precede the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution fixing the Demand Record Date and shall not be more than ten days after the date on which the resolution fixing the Demand Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record entitled to demand a Special Meeting who is seeking to have shareholders demand a Special Meeting shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation, by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a Demand Record Date.

If no Demand Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten days after the date on which such request is received and verified by the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation, then the Demand Record Date shall be the tenth day after the first date on which a valid written request to set a Demand Record Date is received and verified by the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation.

For purposes of these By-Laws, the following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below:
(i) "Affiliate" of any Person (as defined herein) shall mean any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such first Person.
(ii) "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State of Wisconsin are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

(iv) "Person" shall mean any individual, firm, corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity.
(v) "Proxy" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
(vi) "Solicitation" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
(vi) "Soliciting Shareholder" shall mean, with respect to any Special Meeting demanded by a shareholder or shareholders, each of the following Persons:

A "Soliciting Shareholder" shall also mean each Affiliate of a Soliciting Shareholder described in clause (A) or (B) above who is a member of such Soliciting Shareholder's "group" for purposes of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange Act, and any other Affiliate of such a Soliciting Shareholder, if a majority of the directors then in office determines, reasonably and in good faith, that such Affiliate should be required to sign the written notice described in the foregoing Section 3(c) and/or the written agreement described in this Section 3(d) to prevent the purposes of this Section 3 from being evaded.
(e) Except as provided in the following sentence, any Special Meeting shall be held at such date and hour as may be designated by whichever of the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board shall have called such meeting. In the case of any Special Meeting called by the Chairman of the Board upon the demand of shareholders (a "Demand Special Meeting"), such meeting shall be held at such date and hour as may be designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any Demand Special Meeting shall be not more than seventy days after the Meeting Record Date (as defined in Section 6(a) of this Article II); and provided further that in the event that the directors then in office fail to designate a date and hour for a Demand Special Meeting within ten days after the date that valid written demands for such meeting by the holders of record as of the Demand Record Date of shares representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting, calculated as if the Demand Record Date were the record date for the Special Meeting, are delivered to the Corporation (the "Delivery Date"), then such meeting shall be held at 10:00 A.M., local time, on the 100th day after the Delivery Date or, if such 100th day is not a Business Day, on the first preceding Business Day. In fixing a meeting date for any Special Meeting, the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board may consider such factors as it, he or she deems relevant within the good faith exercise of its, his or her business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the action proposed to be taken, the facts and circumstances surrounding any demand for such meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board to call an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting for the conduct of related business.
(f) The Corporation may engage regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as an agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any purported written demand or demands for a Special Meeting received by the Secretary. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no purported demand shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Corporation until the earlier of (i) five Business Days following receipt by the Secretary of such purported demand and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid demands received by the Secretary represent at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting, calculated as if the Demand Record Date were the record date for the Special Meeting. Nothing contained in this Section 3(f) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder
 
shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any demand, whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto).
. .
Section 4

Section 6
Fixing of Record Date
(a) The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date not less than ten days and not more than seventy days prior to the date of an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"). In the case of any Demand Special Meeting, (i) the Meeting Record Date shall be not later than the 30 th day after the Delivery Date and (ii) if the Board of Directors fails to fix the Meeting Record Date within thirty days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on such 30 th day shall be the Meeting Record Date. The shareholders of record on the Meeting Record Date shall be the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or Special Meeting. When a determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at the Annual Meeting or Special Meeting has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall be applied to any adjournment thereof unless the Board of Directors fixes a new Meeting Record Date and except as otherwise required by law. A new Meeting Record Date must be set if a meeting is adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty days after the date fixed for the original meeting.
(b) The Board of Directors may also fix in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to take any other action or determining shareholders for any other purpose other than those set forth in Section 3(a) of this Article II and the foregoing Section 6(a). Such record date shall not be more than seventy days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If the Board of Directors does not fix a record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive a share dividend or distribution (other than a distribution involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the Corporation's shares), then the close of business on the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors is adopted declaring the dividend or distribution shall be the record date.
(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date to determine the shareholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting (the "Consent Record Date"). The Consent Record Date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and such date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation by hand or by certified registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a Consent Record Date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such a valid request is received and verified, adopt a resolution fixing the Consent Record Date and shall make a public announcement of such Consent Record Date. If no Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within
 
ten days after the date on which such a request is received and verified by the Secretary, then the Consent Record Date shall be the 10th day after the first date on which a valid written request to set a Consent Record Date is received and verified by the Secretary. To be valid, such written request shall comply with each of the following:
(i) Such written request shall be signed by one or more shareholders of record and by the beneficial owners or owners, if any, on whose behalf the shareholder or shareholders are acting, shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and shall set forth: (A) the name and address, as they appear on this Corporation's books, of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner who seeks to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting; (B) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned of record and/or beneficially by each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner; (C) a representation that each such shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders; (D) the manner in which each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner intend to comply with Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act in seeking to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting; (E) in the case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to elect or re-elect a director by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, (1) the name and residence address of the person or persons each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director, (2) a description of all arrangements or understandings between each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and each person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect such person as a director, (3) such other information regarding each person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or would be otherwise required to be disclosed, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, including any information that would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A had such person been nominated by the Board of Directors and (4) the written consent of each such person to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected; (F) in the case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to remove a director by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, (1) the names of the director(s) each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to remove and (2) the reasons of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner for asserting that such director(s) may be removed for cause; and (G) in the case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to authorize or take any other corporate action by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, (1) a brief description of the corporate action desired to be authorized or taken and, if such corporate action includes an amendment to these By-Laws, the language of the proposed amendment, (2) the reasons of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner for authorizing or taking such corporate action and (3) any material interest in such corporate action of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner.
 
(ii) Such written request shall be accompanied by a written agreement, which may require furnishing of a bond, signed by each Consent Soliciting Shareholder (as defined below) pursuant to which each Consent Soliciting Shareholder, jointly and severally, agrees to pay the Corporation's costs relating to such Consent Soliciting Shareholder seeking to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, including the costs of preparing and mailing proxy materials for the Corporation's own solicitation, provided that if the Consent Soliciting Shareholder obtains the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents (as defined in Section 11(b) of this Article II) to express the corporate action referred to therein in accordance with these By-Laws, then the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall not be required to pay such costs. For purposes of these By-Laws, "Consent Soliciting Shareholder" shall mean each of the following Persons: (A) if the number of shareholders signing the Consent or Consents is ten or fewer, each Person signing any such Consents; or (B) if the number of shareholders signing the Consent or Consents is more than ten, each Person who either (1) was a Participant in any Solicitation of such consent or consents or (2) at the time of the delivery to the Corporation of the documents described in this Section 6(c) had engaged or intends to engage in any Solicitation of Consents and/or Proxies for expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting (other than a Solicitation of Consents and/or Proxies on behalf of the Corporation).
A "Consent Soliciting Shareholder" shall also mean each Affiliate of a Consent Soliciting Shareholder described in clause (A) or (B) above who is a member of such Consent Soliciting Shareholder's "group" for purposes of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange Act, and any other Affiliate of such a Consent Soliciting Shareholder, if a majority of the directors then in office determine, reasonably and in good faith, that such Affiliate should be required to sign the written notice described in the foregoing Section 6(c)(i) and/or the written agreements described in this Section 6(c)(ii) and the following Section 6(c)(iii) to prevent the purposes of this Section 6(c) and Section 11 of this Article II from being evaded.
(iii) Such written request shall be accompanied by a written agreement signed by each Consent Soliciting Shareholder pursuant to which each Consent Soliciting Shareholder agrees to deliver to any inspectors of election engaged by the Corporation pursuant to Section 11(d) of this Article II within two Business Days after receipt all Consents and revocations thereof received by such Consent Soliciting Shareholder or such Consent Soliciting Shareholder's proxy solicitor or other designated agent in connection with such Consent Soliciting Shareholder seeking to have the shareholders express written consent to corporate action without a meeting.

Section 7
List of Shareholders
 
ordinary business hours, for a period beginning two Business Days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing to the date of the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall be kept and produced at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and subject to the inspection of any shareholders who may be present. The original or duplicate ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or the books of the Corporation or to vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.

Section 8
Quorum; Postponement; Adjournments
(a) Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting only if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to that matter. Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, these By-Laws or in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter by the voting group shall constitute a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. Once a share is represented for any purpose at an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, other than for the purpose of objecting to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of the meeting unless a new Meeting Record Date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting.
(b) The Board of Directors acting by resolution may postpone and reschedule any previously scheduled Annual Meeting or Special Meeting; provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting shall not be postponed beyond the 100th day following the Delivery Date. Any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting may be adjourned from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum, (i) at any time, upon a resolution by shareholders if the votes cast in favor of such resolution by the holders of shares of each voting group entitled to vote on any matter theretofore properly brought before the meeting exceed the number of votes cast against such resolution by the holders of shares of each such voting group or (ii) at any time prior to the transaction of any business at such meeting, by the Chairman of the Board or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting adjourned pursuant to clause (ii) must be reconvened on or before the 100 th day following the Delivery Date. No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
. . Every shareholder of record who is entitled to vote shall at every meeting of the shareholders be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him on the record date; except, however, that shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held by the Corporation, shall neither be
Section 9
Voting
 
entitled to vote nor counted for quorum purposes. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting the right of the Corporation to vote its own stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity. If a quorum exists, then action on a matter, other than the election of directors, by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires a greater number of affirmative votes. Each director shall be elected as provided in Section 2 of Article III. Unless demanded by a shareholder of the Corporation present in person or by proxy at any meeting of the shareholders and entitled to vote thereat or so directed by the chairman of the meeting or required by law, the vote thereat on any question need not be by written ballot. On a vote by written ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the shareholder voting, or in his name by his proxy, if there be such proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted by him and the number of votes to which each share is entitled.
. . At any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, a shareholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. A shareholder entitled to vote at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, or to express consent or dissent in writing to any corporate action without a meeting, may authorize another person to act for the shareholder by appointing the person as a proxy. The means by which a shareholder or the shareholder's authorized officer, director, employee, agent or attorney-in-fact may authorize another person to act for the shareholder by appointing the person as proxy include:
Section 10
Proxies
(a) Appointment of a proxy in writing by signing or causing the shareholder's signature to be affixed to an appointment form by any reasonable means, including, without limitation, by facsimile signature.
(b) Appointment of a proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission of the appointment to the person who will be appointed as proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent authorized to receive the transmission by the person who will be appointed as proxy. Every electronic transmission shall contain, or be accompanied by, information that can be used to reasonably determine that the shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic transmission. Any person charged with determining whether a shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic transmission shall specify the information upon which the determination is made.
An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of election or the officer or agent of the Corporation authorized to tabulate votes. Unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that the proxy is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest, a proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted, either by written notice filed with the Secretary or the secretary of the meeting or by oral notice given by the shareholder to the presiding officer during the meeting. The presence of a shareholder who has made an effective proxy appointment shall not of itself constitute a revocation. A proxy appointment is valid for eleven months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment. The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board and the President each shall have the power and authority to make rules as to the validity and sufficiency of proxies.
 
. .
Section 11
Action without a Meeting
(a) Any action required to be taken at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting or any action which may be taken at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those shareholders who have not consented in writing.
(b) To be valid, each expression of consent to corporate action in writing (a "Consent") shall be in writing; shall set forth the specific corporate action to be taken (which corporate action or actions shall be limited to the action or actions set forth in the written request to set a Consent Record Date received by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II); shall be signed by one or more persons who as of the Consent Record Date are shareholders of record (or their duly authorized proxies); shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder (or their duly authorized proxies); shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation's books, of each shareholder signing such Consent and the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned of record by each such shareholder; in the case of a Person who is not a shareholder of record, shall be accompanied by a proxy or proxies evidencing each such Person's appointment as a proxy for the applicable shareholder of record; and shall be sent to the inspectors of elections engaged by the Corporation pursuant to the following Section 11(d) in accordance with the provisions of the following Section 11(e). Without limiting the foregoing, no Consent shall be valid unless, within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, Consents representing the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate action are delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11; provided, however, that if the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting Consents) has requested a Preliminary Consent Report that is pending on such 70th day pursuant to the following Section 11(f), then such Consents shall be valid if Consents representing the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate action are delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11 at such time as such inspectors issue the Final Consent Report relating to the pending Preliminary Consent Report pursuant to the following Section 11(g) or Section 11(h). The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make rules that are not inconsistent with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law as to the validity of Consents and revocations thereof.
(c) Consents may be revoked at any time prior to the earlier of (i) such time as the inspectors of elections issue a Final Consent Report pursuant to the following Section
 
11(g) or Section 11(h) or (ii) seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II by written notice delivered to (A) the Secretary, (B) any Consent Soliciting Shareholder, (C) to a proxy solicitor or other agent designated by the Corporation or any Consent Soliciting Shareholder and/or (D) the inspectors of elections engaged by the Corporation pursuant to the following Section 11(d).
(d) Within three Business Days after a Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, the Corporation shall (i) engage regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of Consents and revocations thereof and (ii) provide notice to each Consent Soliciting Shareholder of the identity of such inspectors and the manner in which such Consent Soliciting Shareholder may deliver Consents and revocations thereof to such inspectors pursuant to the following Section 11(e). Except as provided in Section 6(c)(ii) of this Article II, the cost of retaining inspectors of election shall be borne by the Corporation.
(e) The Corporation, the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and their respective proxy solicitors or other designated agents shall deliver Consents and revocations thereof to the inspectors within two Business Days after receipt. As soon as the inspectors receive Consents and/or revocations thereof, the inspectors shall review the Consents and revocations thereof and shall maintain a count of the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents. The inspectors shall keep such count confidential and shall not reveal the count to any Person; provided, however, that, as soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder, the inspectors shall issue a report (a "Consent Report") to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders stating: (i) the number of shares subject to valid Consents; (ii) the number of shares subject to valid revocations of Consents; (iii) the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents; (iv) the number of shares subject to invalid Consents; (v) the number of shares subject to invalid revocations of Consents; (vi) whether, based on their count, the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents has been obtained to express the corporate action specified in the Consents; and (vii) the latest date the inspectors received Consents and revocations thereof that the inspectors reflected in such report (the "Report Date").
(f) As soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting Consents), notice of which request shall be given to the Corporation and any parties opposing the solicitation of Consents, if any, which request shall state that the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, have a good faith belief that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents has been received in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and these By-Laws, the inspectors shall issue and deliver to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a preliminary Consent Report (the "Preliminary Consent Report"); provided, however, that neither the Corporation nor the Consent Soliciting Shareholders may request a Preliminary Consent Report after the 70 th day after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II. Unless
 
the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall agree to a shorter or longer period, the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall have two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report to review the Consents and revocations thereof and to advise the inspectors and the opposing parties in writing as to whether they intend to challenge the Preliminary Consent Report.
(g) If no written notice of an intention to challenge a Preliminary Consent Report is received within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report by the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and either (i) the date that is two Business Days after such receipt of such Preliminary Consent Report (the "Cut-Off Date") is more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II or (ii) the Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders their final Consent Report (a "Final Consent Report"), which shall contain the information included in the Preliminary Consent Report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of Consents and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent Report Report Date to the time of issuance of the Final Consent Report, if such Consents and revocations thereof are received within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, and a certification as to whether the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained. If the Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number or shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue a Consent Report to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a Preliminary Consent Report in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Section 11(f).
(h) If the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders issue written notice to the inspectors and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, of an intention to challenge a Preliminary Consent Report within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report by the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, then a challenge session shall be scheduled by the inspectors as promptly as practicable, at which the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall have the right to object to the validity of Consents and revocations thereof. A transcript of the challenge session shall be recorded by a certified court reporter. Following completion of the challenge session, if either (i) the date on which the challenge session is completed (the "Completion Date") is more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this
 
Article II or (ii) the Completion Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a Final Consent Report, which shall contain the information included in the Preliminary Consent Report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of the challenge and, if such Consents and revocations thereof are received within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, Consents and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent Report Report Date to the time of issuance of the Final Report, and a certification as to whether the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained. If the Completion Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue a Consent Report to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a Preliminary Consent Report in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Section 11(f).
(j) Simultaneously with the delivery of any Final Consent Report to the Corporation pursuant to the foregoing Section 11(g) or Section 11(4), the inspectors shall deliver all valid and unrevoked Consents to the Corporation, which shall constitute delivery of such Consents to the Corporation for purposes of Section 180.0704 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law and the Articles of Incorporation. A copy of any Final Consent Report shall be included in the book in which the proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded.
(k) As to any Consent, if, prior to the issuance of a Final Consent Report and delivery of Consents to the Corporation, all Consent Soliciting Shareholders notify the Corporation and the inspectors in writing that such Consent Soliciting Shareholders no longer desire to express consent to the corporate actions specified in the Consents, then the Consents shall be deemed abandoned, and the inspectors shall not issue a Final Consent Report or deliver such Consents to the Corporation.

(e) Two or more persons are the shareholders as co-tenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the co-owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all co-owners.
The Corporation may reject a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if the Secretary or other officer or agent of the Corporation who is authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder.

Section 1
Powers
. .
Section 2
Election and Term
(a) The Board of Directors shall be divided into three groups, which are hereby designated as Group One, Group Two and Group Three. The term of office of the initial Group One Directors shall expire at the next annual meeting of shareholders; the term of office of the initial Group Two Directors shall expire at the second succeeding annual meeting of shareholders; and the term of office of the initial Group Three Directors shall expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. At each annual shareholders meeting held thereafter, Directors to replace those whose terms expire at such annual meeting shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting and until their successors are elected and qualify, or until they sooner die, resign or are removed. Acceptance of the office of Director may be expressed orally or in writing, and attendance at a meeting shall constitute such acceptance.
(b) Except as provided in this Section 2, each Director shall be elected by the majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director's election at any meeting of shareholders for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present and the election is not a Contested Election. For purposes of this Section 2, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a Director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "withheld" with respect to that Director's election. Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast with respect to that Director's election. If at the close of the notice periods set forth in Section 5 of Article II, the Chairman of the Board determines that the number of persons properly nominated to serve as Directors of the Corporation exceeds the number of Directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), each Director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast with respect to that Director's election at the meeting at which a quorum is present.
(c) In an election of Directors that is not a Contested Election, any nominee who was an incumbent Director whose term would otherwise have expired at the time of the election if a successor had been elected who receives a number of votes cast "for" his
 
or her election less than the number of votes cast "withheld" with respect to his or her election (a "Majority Against Vote") will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board following certification of the shareholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors will promptly consider the resignation submitted by such director, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept the tendered resignation or to reject it. In considering whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, including, without limitation, the stated reasons why shareholders "withheld" votes for election from such Director, the length of service and qualifications of the Director whose resignation has been tendered and the Director's contributions to the Corporation. The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the meeting of shareholders at which the election occurred. In considering the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board of Directors will consider the factors considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and such additional information and factors the Board of Directors believes to be relevant. Following the Board of Directors' decision, the Corporation will promptly publicly disclose in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the Board of Directors' decision whether to accept the resignation as tendered, including a full explanation of the process by which the decision was reached and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation. Any Director who tenders a resignation pursuant to this provision will not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board of Directors consideration regarding whether or not to accept the tendered resignation. If a majority of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received Majority Against Votes at the same election, then the independent Directors who are on the Board of Directors who did not receive Majority Against Votes or who were not standing for election will appoint a committee of the Board of Directors among themselves for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and will recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject them. This committee of the Board of Directors may, but need not, consist of all of the independent Directors who did not receive Majority Against Votes or who were not standing for election.
(d) If a Director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 2, or if a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent Director whose term would otherwise have expired at the time of the election if a successor had been elected, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 of Article III of these By-Laws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of Article III of these By-Laws.
. . The number of Directors shall be such number as shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors but shall not be less than three nor more than eleven.
Section 3

. . Each Director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders in the year in which such Director's term expires and until his successor shall have been elected, or until his prior death, resignation or removal for cause only. A Director may be removed from office for cause only by affirmative vote of eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for the election of such Director, taken at an annual meeting or a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, and any vacancy so created may be filled by the affirmative vote of eighty percent (80%) of such shares. Directors need not be residents of the State of Wisconsin or shareholders of the Corporation.

Alternatively, the Company may require such Participant to pay to the Company, in cash, promptly on demand, or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment to the Company of the aggregate amount of any such taxes and other amounts. If Shares are deliverable upon exercise or payment of an Award, the Committee may permit a Participant to satisfy all or a portion of the Federal, state and local withholding tax obligations arising in connection with such Award by electing to (a) have the Company withhold Shares otherwise issuable under the Award, (b) tender back Shares received in connection with such Award, or (c) deliver other previously owned Shares; provided that the amount to be withheld may not exceed the total minimum federal, state and local tax withholding obligations associated with the transaction to the extent needed for the Company to avoid an accounting charge.

Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan, the Company does not guarantee to any Participant or any other Person with an interest in an Award that (i) any Award intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A shall be so exempt, (ii) any Award intended to comply with Code Section 409A or Code Section 422 shall so comply, (iii) any Award shall otherwise receive a specific tax treatment under any other applicable tax law, nor in any such case will the Company or any Affiliate indemnify, defend or hold harmless any individual with respect to the tax consequences of any Award.

17.    .
Adjustment Provisions; Change of Control
(a)    .  If: (i) the Company shall at any time be involved in a merger or other transaction in which the Shares are changed or exchanged; (ii) the Company shall subdivide or combine the Shares or the Company shall declare a dividend payable in Shares, other securities (other than preferred stock purchase rights issued pursuant to the terms of the Company's Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated as of February 24, 1998, as amended from time to time, or any successor to such Rights Agreement, or any similar stock purchase rights that the Company may authorize and issue in the future) or other property; (iii) the Company shall effect a cash dividend the amount of which, on a per Share basis, exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share at the time the dividend is declared, or the Company shall effect any other dividend or other distribution on the Shares in the form of cash, or a repurchase of Shares, that the Board determines by resolution is special or extraordinary in nature or that is in connection with a transaction that the Company characterizes publicly as a recapitalization or reorganization involving the Shares; or (iv) any other event shall occur, which, in the case of this clause (iv), in the judgment of the Board or Committee necessitates an adjustment to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Plan, then the Administrator shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Plan, adjust as applicable: (A) the number and type of Shares subject to this Plan (including the number and type of Shares described in Sections 6(a), (b) and (d)) and which may after the event be made the subject of Awards; (B) the number and type of Shares subject to outstanding Awards; (C) the grant, purchase, or exercise price with respect to any Award; and (D) to the extent such discretion does not cause an Award that is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m) to lose its status as such, the Performance Goals of an Award. In each case, with respect to Awards of incentive stock options, no such adjustment may be authorized to the extent that such authority would cause this Plan to violate Code Section 422(b). Without limitation, in the event of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination or other similar corporate transaction or event,
Adjustment of Shares
 
whether or not constituting a Change of Control (other than any such transaction in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the outstanding Stock is not being converted into or exchanged for different securities, cash or other property, or any combination thereof), the Administrator may substitute, on an equitable basis as the Administrator determines, for each Share then subject to an Award and the Shares subject to this Plan (if the Plan will continue in effect), the number and kind of shares of stock, other securities, cash or other property to which holders of Stock are or will be entitled in respect of each Share pursuant to the transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a stock dividend (other than a stock dividend declared in lieu of an ordinary cash dividend) or subdivision or combination of the Shares (including a reverse stock split), if no action is taken by the Administrator, adjustments contemplated by this subsection that are proportionate shall nevertheless automatically be made as of the date of such stock dividend or subdivision or combination of the Shares.
(b)    .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, and without affecting the number of Shares otherwise reserved or available under this Plan, in connection with any merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, or reorganization, the Administrator may authorize the issuance or assumption of awards under this Plan upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate.
Issuance or Assumption
(c)    .  If the Participant has in effect an employment, retention, change of control, severance or similar agreement with the Company or any Affiliate that discusses the effect of a Change of Control on the Participant's Awards, then such agreement shall control. In all other cases, unless provided otherwise in an Award agreement, in the event of a Change of Control:
Change of Control
(i)    The successor or purchaser in the Change of Control transaction may assume an Award or provide a substitute award with similar terms and conditions, and preserving the same benefits, as the Award it is replacing.
(ii)    If the successor or purchaser in the Change of Control transaction does not assume the Awards or issue replacement awards as provided in clause (i), then unless otherwise determined by the Board prior to the date of the Change of Control, immediately prior to the date of the Change of Control:
(A)    each Option or SAR that is then held by a Participant who is employed by or in the service of the Company or an Affiliate shall become immediately and fully vested, and all Options and SARs shall be cancelled on the date of the Change of Control in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of the Change of Control price of the Shares covered by the Option or SAR that is so cancelled over the purchase or grant price of such Shares under the Award;
(B)    Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that are not then vested shall vest;
(C)    all Performance Shares and/or Performance Units that are earned but not yet paid shall be paid in cash in an amount equal to the value of the Performance Share and/or Performance Unit, and all Performance Shares and Performance Units for which the performance period has not expired shall be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the product of the value of the Performance Share and/or Performance Unit and a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months that have elapsed from the beginning of the performance period to which the Award is subject to the date of the Change of Control and the denominator of which is the number of whole months in the performance period;
(D)    all Annual and Long-Term Incentive Awards that are earned but not yet paid shall be paid, and all Annual and Long-Term Incentive Awards that are not yet earned shall be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in an amount determined by taking the product of: (1) the amount that would have been due under such Award(s) if the Performance Goals (as measured at the time of the Change of Control) were to continue to be achieved at the same rate through the end of the performance period; and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months that have elapsed from the beginning of the performance period to which the Award
 
is subject to the date of the Change of Control and the denominator of which is the number of whole months in the performance period; and
(E)    all Dividend Equivalent Units that are not vested shall vest and be paid in cash, and all other Awards that are not vested shall vest and if an amount is payable under such vested Award, such amount shall be paid in cash based on the value of the Award.
If the value of an Award is based on the Fair Market Value of a Share, Fair Market Value shall be deemed to mean the per share Change of Control price. The Administrator shall determine the per share Change of Control price paid or deemed paid in the Change of Control transaction.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in any agreement between a Participant and the Company or an Affiliate, if the receipt of any payment by a Participant under the circumstances described above would result in the payment by the Participant of any excise tax provided for in Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code, then the amount of such payment shall be reduced to the extent required to prevent the imposition of such excise tax.
18.    .
Miscellaneous
(a)    .   The grant of any Award may also be subject to other provisions (whether or not applicable to the Award granted to any other Participant) as the Administrator determines appropriate, including, without limitation, provisions for:
Other Terms and Conditions
(i)    the payment of the purchase price of Options by delivery of cash or other Shares or other securities of the Company (including by attestation) having a then Fair Market Value equal to the purchase price of such Shares, or by delivery (including by fax) to the Company or its designated agent of an executed irrevocable option exercise form together with irrevocable instructions to a broker dealer to sell or margin a sufficient portion of the Shares and deliver the sale or margin loan proceeds directly to the Company to pay for the exercise price;
(ii)    restrictions on resale or other disposition of Shares; and
(iii)    compliance with federal or state securities laws and stock exchange requirements.
(b)    .  The issuance of an Award shall not confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continued employment or service with the Company or any Affiliate, or the right to continue as a Director. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, for purposes of the Plan and all Awards, the following rules shall apply:
Employment and Service
(i)    a Participant who transfers employment between the Company and its Affiliates, or between Affiliates, will not be considered to have terminated employment;
(ii)    a Participant who ceases to be a Non-Employee Director because he or she becomes an employee of the Company or an Affiliate shall not be considered to have ceased service as a Director with respect to any Award until such Participant's termination of employment with the Company and its Affiliates;
(iii)    a Participant who ceases to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate and immediately thereafter becomes a Non-Employee Director, a non-employee director of an Affiliate, or a consultant to the Company or any Affiliate shall not be considered to have terminated employment until such Participant's service as a director of, or consultant to, the Company and its Affiliates has ceased; and
(iv)    a Participant employed by an Affiliate will be considered to have terminated employment when such entity ceases to be an Affiliate.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of an Award that is subject to Code Section 409A, if a Participant's termination of employment or service triggers the payment of compensation under such Award, then the Participant will be deemed to have terminated employment or service upon his or her "separation from service" within the meaning of Code Section 409A.
(c)    .  No fractional Shares or other securities may be issued or delivered pursuant to this Plan, and the Administrator may determine whether cash, other securities or other property will be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares or other securities, or whether such fractional Shares or other securities or any rights to fractional Shares or other securities will be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.
No Fractional Shares
(d)    .  This Plan is unfunded and does not create, and should not be construed to create, a trust or separate fund with respect to this Plan's benefits. This Plan does not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person. To the extent any person holds any rights by virtue of an Award granted under this Plan, such rights are no greater than the rights of the Company's general unsecured creditors.
Unfunded Plan
(e)    .  The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares in connection with an Award are subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any award agreement, the Company has no liability to deliver any Shares under this Plan or make any payment unless such delivery or payment would comply with all applicable laws and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity, and unless and until the Participant has taken all actions required by the Company in connection therewith. The Company may impose such restrictions on any Shares issued under the Plan as the Company determines necessary or desirable to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations or the requirements of any national securities exchanges.
Requirements of Law and Securities Exchange
(f)    .  This Plan, and all agreements under this Plan, will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Wisconsin, without reference to any conflict of law principles. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Plan, any Award or any award agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Plan, any Award or any award agreement, may only be heard in a "bench" trial, and any party to such action or proceeding shall agree to waive its right to a jury trial.
Governing Law
(g)    .  Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Plan, any Award or any award agreement, must be brought within one year (365 days) after the day the complaining party first knew or should have known of the events giving rise to the complaint.
Limitations on Actions
(h)    .  Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine, they shall be construed as though they were used in the feminine in all cases where they would so apply; and wherever any words are used in the singular or plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply. Title of sections are for general information only, and this Plan is not to be construed with reference to such titles.
Construction
(i).  If any provision of this Plan or any award agreement or any Award (a) is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person or Award, or (b) would disqualify this Plan, any award agreement or any Award under any law the Administrator deems applicable, then such provision should be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Administrator, materially altering the intent of this Plan, award agreement or Award, then such provision should be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of this Plan, such award agreement and such Award will remain in full force and effect.
