Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Rule changes promulgated by the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC require Nasdaq-listed companies to be eligible for a direct registration system ("DRS") by January 1, 2008. DRS refers to a system by which shares may be held in book entry form without a certificate. At a meeting held on August 14, 2007, the board of directors of Fiserv, Inc. (the "Company") adopted amended and restated by-laws in order to ensure that the Company's securities are DRS-eligible. As amended and restated, Article VI of the by-laws permit the Company to issue certificated or uncertificated shares. Previously, the Company's by-laws provided for certificated shares only. The Company's amended and restated by-laws are filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1, and are incorporated herein by reference.

EXHIBIT 3.1
 
 
 
 
The registered office of the Corporation in the State of Wisconsin shall be located in the City of Brookfield, County of Waukesha. The Corporation may establish or discontinue, from time to time, such other offices within or without the State of Wisconsin as may be deemed proper for the conduct of the Corporation's business.
. . All meetings of shareholders shall be held at such place or places, within or without the State of Wisconsin, as may from time to time be fixed by the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board, or as shall be specified in the respective notices, or waivers of notice, thereof. Any meeting may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to Section 8 of this Article II to reconvene at any place designated by vote of the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board.
Section 1
Place of Meetings
. . The annual meeting of shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") shall be held on such date and at such place as may be fixed by the Board of Directors. In fixing a meeting date for any Annual Meeting, the Board of Directors may consider such factors as it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of its business judgment. At each Annual Meeting, the shareholders shall elect individuals to the Board of Directors in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Corporation. At any such Annual Meeting, only other business properly brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance with Section 5 of this Article II may be transacted.
Section 2
Annual Meeting

Section 3
Special Meetings
(a) A special meeting of the shareholders (a "Special Meeting") may be called only by (i) a majority of the Board of Directors, (ii) the Chairman of the Board or (iii) the President. The President shall call a Special Meeting upon the demand, in accordance with this Section 3, of the holders of record representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting.
(b) To enable the Corporation to determine the shareholders entitled to demand a Special Meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date to determine the
 
shareholders entitled to make such a demand (the "Demand Record Date"). The Demand Record Date shall not precede the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution fixing the Demand Record Date and shall not be more than ten days after the date on which the resolution fixing the Demand Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of record entitled to demand a Special Meeting who is seeking to have shareholders demand a Special Meeting shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation, by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a Demand Record Date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which a valid request to fix a Demand Record Date is received and verified, adopt a resolution fixing the Demand Record Date and shall make a public announcement of such Demand Record Date. If no Demand Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten days after the date on which such request is received and verified by the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation, then the Demand Record Date shall be the tenth day after the first date on which a valid written request to set a Demand Record Date is received and verified by the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation. To be valid, such written request shall set forth the purpose or purposes for which the Special Meeting is to be held, shall be signed by one or more shareholders of record and by the beneficial owner or owners, if any, on whose behalf the request is made, shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and shall set forth all information about each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner that would be required to be set forth in a shareholder's notice described in Section 5(a)(ii) of this Article II as if the notice related to an Annual Meeting.
(c) For a shareholder or shareholders to demand a Special Meeting, a written demand or demands for a Special Meeting by the holders of record as of the Demand Record Date of shares representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting, calculated as if the Demand Record Date were the record date for the Special Meeting, must be delivered to the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation. To be valid, each written demand by a shareholder for a Special Meeting shall set forth the specific purpose or purposes for which the Special Meeting is to be held (which purpose or purposes shall be limited to the purpose or purposes set forth in the written request to set a Demand Record Date received by the Corporation pursuant to the foregoing Section 3(b)), shall be signed by one or more persons who as of the Demand Record Date are shareholders of record and by the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf the demand is made, shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner, shall set forth the name and address of each such shareholder (as they appear in the Corporation's books) and any such beneficial owner signing such demand and the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned of record and/or beneficially by each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner, shall be sent to the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation, by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall be received by the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation within seventy days after the Demand Record Date.
 
(d) The Corporation shall not be required to call a Special Meeting upon shareholder demand unless, in addition to the documents required by the foregoing Section 3(c), the Secretary receives a written agreement, which may require furnishing of a bond, signed by each Soliciting Shareholder (as defined below) pursuant to which each Soliciting Shareholder, jointly and severally, agrees to pay the Corporation's costs of holding the Special Meeting, including the costs of preparing and mailing proxy materials for the Corporation's own solicitation, provided that if each of the resolutions introduced by any Soliciting Shareholder at such meeting is adopted, and each of the individuals nominated by or on behalf of any Soliciting Shareholder for election as a director at such meeting is elected, then the Soliciting Shareholders shall not be required to pay such costs. For purposes of these By-Laws, the following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below:
(i) "Affiliate" of any Person (as defined herein) shall mean any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such first Person.
(ii) "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State of Wisconsin are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

(iv) "Person" shall mean any individual, firm, corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity.
(v) "Proxy" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(B) if the number of shareholders signing the demand or demands of meeting delivered to the Corporation pursuant to the foregoing Section 3(c) is more than ten, each Person who either (I) was a Participant in any Solicitation of such demand or demands or (II) at the time of the delivery to the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation of the documents described in the foregoing Section 3(c) had engaged or intends to engage in any Solicitation of Proxies for use at such Special Meeting (other than a Solicitation of Proxies on behalf of the Corporation).
 
A "Soliciting Shareholder" shall also mean each Affiliate of a Soliciting Shareholder described in clause (A) or (B) above who is a member of such Soliciting Shareholder's "group" for purposes of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange Act, and any other Affiliate of such a Soliciting Shareholder, if a majority of the directors then in office determines, reasonably and in good faith, that such Affiliate should be required to sign the written notice described in the foregoing Section 3(c) and/or the written agreement described in this Section 3(d) to prevent the purposes of this Section 3 from being evaded.
(e) Except as provided in the following sentence, any Special Meeting shall be held at such date and hour as may be designated by whichever of the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board shall have called such meeting. In the case of any Special Meeting called by the Chairman of the Board upon the demand of shareholders (a "Demand Special Meeting"), such meeting shall be held at such date and hour as may be designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any Demand Special Meeting shall be not more than seventy days after the Meeting Record Date (as defined in Section 6(a) of this Article II); and provided further that in the event that the directors then in office fail to designate a date and hour for a Demand Special Meeting within ten days after the date that valid written demands for such meeting by the holders of record as of the Demand Record Date of shares representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting, calculated as if the Demand Record Date were the record date for the Special Meeting, are delivered to the Corporation (the "Delivery Date"), then such meeting shall be held at 10:00 A.M., local time, on the 100th day after the Delivery Date or, if such 100th day is not a Business Day, on the first preceding Business Day. In fixing a meeting date for any Special Meeting, the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board may consider such factors as it, he or she deems relevant within the good faith exercise of its, his or her business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the action proposed to be taken, the facts and circumstances surrounding any demand for such meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board to call an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting for the conduct of related business.
(f) The Corporation may engage regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as an agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any purported written demand or demands for a Special Meeting received by the Secretary. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no purported demand shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Corporation until the earlier of (i) five Business Days following receipt by the Secretary of such purported demand and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid demands received by the Secretary represent at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the Special Meeting, calculated as if the Demand Record Date were the record date for the Special Meeting. Nothing contained in this Section 3(f) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any shareholder
 
shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any demand, whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto).

Once a share is represented for any purpose at an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, other than for the purpose of objecting to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of the meeting unless a new Meeting Record Date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting.
(b) The Board of Directors acting by resolution may postpone and reschedule any previously scheduled Annual Meeting or Special Meeting; provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting shall not be postponed beyond the 100th day following the Delivery Date. Any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting may be adjourned from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum, (i) at any time, upon a resolution by shareholders if the votes cast in favor of such resolution by the holders of shares of each voting group entitled to vote on any matter theretofore properly brought before the meeting exceed the number of votes cast against such resolution by the holders of shares of each such voting group or (ii) at any time prior to the transaction of any business at such meeting, by the Chairman of the Board or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting adjourned pursuant to clause (ii) must be reconvened on or before the 100 th day following the Delivery Date. No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
. . Every shareholder of record who is entitled to vote shall at every meeting of the shareholders be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him on the record date; except, however, that shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held by the Corporation, shall neither be
Section 9
Voting
 
entitled to vote nor counted for quorum purposes. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting the right of the Corporation to vote its own stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity. If a quorum exists, then action on a matter, other than the election of directors, by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires a greater number of affirmative votes. Each director shall be elected as provided in Section 2 of Article III. Unless demanded by a shareholder of the Corporation present in person or by proxy at any meeting of the shareholders and entitled to vote thereat or so directed by the chairman of the meeting or required by law, the vote thereat on any question need not be by written ballot. On a vote by written ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the shareholder voting, or in his name by his proxy, if there be such proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted by him and the number of votes to which each share is entitled.
. . At any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, a shareholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. A shareholder entitled to vote at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, or to express consent or dissent in writing to any corporate action without a meeting, may authorize another person to act for the shareholder by appointing the person as a proxy. The means by which a shareholder or the shareholder's authorized officer, director, employee, agent or attorney-in-fact may authorize another person to act for the shareholder by appointing the person as proxy include:
Section 10
Proxies
(a) Appointment of a proxy in writing by signing or causing the shareholder's signature to be affixed to an appointment form by any reasonable means, including, without limitation, by facsimile signature.
(b) Appointment of a proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission of the appointment to the person who will be appointed as proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent authorized to receive the transmission by the person who will be appointed as proxy. Every electronic transmission shall contain, or be accompanied by, information that can be used to reasonably determine that the shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic transmission. Any person charged with determining whether a shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic transmission shall specify the information upon which the determination is made.
An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of election or the officer or agent of the Corporation authorized to tabulate votes. Unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that the proxy is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest, a proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted, either by written notice filed with the Secretary or the secretary of the meeting or by oral notice given by the shareholder to the presiding officer during the meeting. The presence of a shareholder who has made an effective proxy appointment shall not of itself constitute a revocation. A proxy appointment is valid for eleven months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment. The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board and the President each shall have the power and authority to make rules as to the validity and sufficiency of proxies.
 
. .
Section 11
Action without a Meeting
(a) Any action required to be taken at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting or any action which may be taken at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those shareholders who have not consented in writing.
(b) To be valid, each expression of consent to corporate action in writing (a "Consent") shall be in writing; shall set forth the specific corporate action to be taken (which corporate action or actions shall be limited to the action or actions set forth in the written request to set a Consent Record Date received by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II); shall be signed by one or more persons who as of the Consent Record Date are shareholders of record (or their duly authorized proxies); shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder (or their duly authorized proxies); shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation's books, of each shareholder signing such Consent and the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned of record by each such shareholder; in the case of a Person who is not a shareholder of record, shall be accompanied by a proxy or proxies evidencing each such Person's appointment as a proxy for the applicable shareholder of record; and shall be sent to the inspectors of elections engaged by the Corporation pursuant to the following Section 11(d) in accordance with the provisions of the following Section 11(e). Without limiting the foregoing, no Consent shall be valid unless, within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, Consents representing the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate action are delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11; provided, however, that if the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting Consents) has requested a Preliminary Consent Report that is pending on such 70th day pursuant to the following Section 11(f), then such Consents shall be valid if Consents representing the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate action are delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11 at such time as such inspectors issue the Final Consent Report relating to the pending Preliminary Consent Report pursuant to the following Section 11(g) or Section 11(h). The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make rules that are not inconsistent with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law as to the validity of Consents and revocations thereof.
(c) Consents may be revoked at any time prior to the earlier of (i) such time as the inspectors of elections issue a Final Consent Report pursuant to the following Section
 
11(g) or Section 11(h) or (ii) seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II by written notice delivered to (A) the Secretary, (B) any Consent Soliciting Shareholder, (C) to a proxy solicitor or other agent designated by the Corporation or any Consent Soliciting Shareholder and/or (D) the inspectors of elections engaged by the Corporation pursuant to the following Section 11(d).
(d) Within three Business Days after a Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, the Corporation shall (i) engage regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of Consents and revocations thereof and (ii) provide notice to each Consent Soliciting Shareholder of the identity of such inspectors and the manner in which such Consent Soliciting Shareholder may deliver Consents and revocations thereof to such inspectors pursuant to the following Section 11(e). Except as provided in Section 6(c)(ii) of this Article II, the cost of retaining inspectors of election shall be borne by the Corporation.
(e) The Corporation, the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and their respective proxy solicitors or other designated agents shall deliver Consents and revocations thereof to the inspectors within two Business Days after receipt. As soon as the inspectors receive Consents and/or revocations thereof, the inspectors shall review the Consents and revocations thereof and shall maintain a count of the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents. The inspectors shall keep such count confidential and shall not reveal the count to any Person; provided, however, that, as soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder, the inspectors shall issue a report (a "Consent Report") to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders stating: (i) the number of shares subject to valid Consents; (ii) the number of shares subject to valid revocations of Consents; (iii) the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents; (iv) the number of shares subject to invalid Consents; (v) the number of shares subject to invalid revocations of Consents; (vi) whether, based on their count, the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents has been obtained to express the corporate action specified in the Consents; and (vii) the latest date the inspectors received Consents and revocations thereof that the inspectors reflected in such report (the "Report Date").
(f) As soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting Consents), notice of which request shall be given to the Corporation and any parties opposing the solicitation of Consents, if any, which request shall state that the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, have a good faith belief that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents has been received in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and these By-Laws, the inspectors shall issue and deliver to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a preliminary Consent Report (the "Preliminary Consent Report"); provided, however, that neither the Corporation nor the Consent Soliciting Shareholders may request a Preliminary Consent Report after the 70 th day after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II. Unless
 
the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall agree to a shorter or longer period, the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall have two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report to review the Consents and revocations thereof and to advise the inspectors and the opposing parties in writing as to whether they intend to challenge the Preliminary Consent Report.
(g) If no written notice of an intention to challenge a Preliminary Consent Report is received within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report by the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and either (i) the date that is two Business Days after such receipt of such Preliminary Consent Report (the "Cut-Off Date") is more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II or (ii) the Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders their final Consent Report (a "Final Consent Report"), which shall contain the information included in the Preliminary Consent Report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of Consents and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent Report Report Date to the time of issuance of the Final Consent Report, if such Consents and revocations thereof are received within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, and a certification as to whether the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained. If the Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number or shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue a Consent Report to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a Preliminary Consent Report in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Section 11(f).
(h) If the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders issue written notice to the inspectors and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, of an intention to challenge a Preliminary Consent Report within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report by the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, then a challenge session shall be scheduled by the inspectors as promptly as practicable, at which the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall have the right to object to the validity of Consents and revocations thereof. A transcript of the challenge session shall be recorded by a certified court reporter. Following completion of the challenge session, if either (i) the date on which the challenge session is completed (the "Completion Date") is more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this
 
Article II or (ii) the Completion Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a Final Consent Report, which shall contain the information included in the Preliminary Consent Report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of the challenge and, if such Consents and revocations thereof are received within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, Consents and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent Report Report Date to the time of issuance of the Final Report, and a certification as to whether the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained. If the Completion Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue a Consent Report to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a Preliminary Consent Report in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Section 11(f).
(j) Simultaneously with the delivery of any Final Consent Report to the Corporation pursuant to the foregoing Section 11(g) or Section 11(4), the inspectors shall deliver all valid and unrevoked Consents to the Corporation, which shall constitute delivery of such Consents to the Corporation for purposes of Section 180.0704 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law and the Articles of Incorporation. A copy of any Final Consent Report shall be included in the book in which the proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded.
(k) As to any Consent, if, prior to the issuance of a Final Consent Report and delivery of Consents to the Corporation, all Consent Soliciting Shareholders notify the Corporation and the inspectors in writing that such Consent Soliciting Shareholders no longer desire to express consent to the corporate actions specified in the Consents, then the Consents shall be deemed abandoned, and the inspectors shall not issue a Final Consent Report or deliver such Consents to the Corporation.
. . If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation, acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of a shareholder. If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation, acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if any of the following apply:
Section 12

(a) The shareholder is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity.
 
(b) The name purports to be that of a personal representative, administrator, executor, guardian or conservator representing the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the Corporation is presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment.
(c) The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the Corporation is presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment.
(d) The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial owner, or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the Corporation of the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder is presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment.
(e) Two or more persons are the shareholders as co-tenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the co-owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all co-owners.
The Corporation may reject a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if the Secretary or other officer or agent of the Corporation who is authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder.
. . The Chairman of the Board or, in his or her absence, the President or, in the President's absence, a Vice President designated by the Board of Directors, shall call any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting to order and shall act as chairman of the meeting, and the Secretary shall act as secretary of all meetings of the shareholders, but, in the absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any other person to act as secretary of the meeting. The Board of Directors may, to the extent not prohibited by law, adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting as it shall deem appropriate.

Section 1
Powers
. .
Section 2
Election and Term
(a) The Board of Directors shall be divided into three groups, which are hereby designated as Group One, Group Two and Group Three. The term of office of the initial Group One Directors shall expire at the next annual meeting of shareholders; the term of office of the initial Group Two Directors shall expire at the second succeeding annual meeting of shareholders; and the term of office of the initial Group Three Directors shall expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. At each annual shareholders meeting held thereafter, Directors to replace those whose terms expire at such annual meeting shall be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting and until their successors are elected and qualify, or until they sooner die, resign or are removed. Acceptance of the office of Director may be expressed orally or in writing, and attendance at a meeting shall constitute such acceptance.
(b) Except as provided in this Section 2, each Director shall be elected by the majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director's election at any meeting of shareholders for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present and the election is not a Contested Election. For purposes of this Section 2, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a Director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "withheld" with respect to that Director's election. Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast with respect to that Director's election. If at the close of the notice periods set forth in Section 5 of Article II, the Chairman of the Board determines that the number of persons properly nominated to serve as Directors of the Corporation exceeds the number of Directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), each Director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast with respect to that Director's election at the meeting at which a quorum is present.
(c) In an election of Directors that is not a Contested Election, any nominee who was an incumbent Director whose term would otherwise have expired at the time of the election if a successor had been elected who receives a number of votes cast "for" his
 
or her election less than the number of votes cast "withheld" with respect to his or her election (a "Majority Against Vote") will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board following certification of the shareholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors will promptly consider the resignation submitted by such director, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept the tendered resignation or to reject it. In considering whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, including, without limitation, the stated reasons why shareholders "withheld" votes for election from such Director, the length of service and qualifications of the Director whose resignation has been tendered and the Director's contributions to the Corporation. The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the meeting of shareholders at which the election occurred. In considering the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board of Directors will consider the factors considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and such additional information and factors the Board of Directors believes to be relevant. Following the Board of Directors' decision, the Corporation will promptly publicly disclose in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the Board of Directors' decision whether to accept the resignation as tendered, including a full explanation of the process by which the decision was reached and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation. Any Director who tenders a resignation pursuant to this provision will not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board of Directors consideration regarding whether or not to accept the tendered resignation. If a majority of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received Majority Against Votes at the same election, then the independent Directors who are on the Board of Directors who did not receive Majority Against Votes or who were not standing for election will appoint a committee of the Board of Directors among themselves for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and will recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject them. This committee of the Board of Directors may, but need not, consist of all of the independent Directors who did not receive Majority Against Votes or who were not standing for election.
(d) If a Director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 2, or if a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent Director whose term would otherwise have expired at the time of the election if a successor had been elected, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 of Article III of these By-Laws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of Article III of these By-Laws.
. . The number of Directors shall be such number as shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors but shall not be less than three nor more than eleven.
Section 3
Number
 
. . Each Director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders in the year in which such Director's term expires and until his successor shall have been elected, or until his prior death, resignation or removal for cause only. A Director may be removed from office for cause only by affirmative vote of eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for the election of such Director, taken at an annual meeting or a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, and any vacancy so created may be filled by the affirmative vote of eighty percent (80%) of such shares. Directors need not be residents of the State of Wisconsin or shareholders of the Corporation.
Section 4

. . Unless otherwise provided by law, the presence of fifty-one percent (51%) of the whole Board of Directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given. At all meetings of Directors, a quorum being present, all matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the majority of the Directors present, except as otherwise required by law. The Board of Directors may hold its meetings at such place or places within or without the State of Wisconsin as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or as shall be specified in the respective notices, or waivers of notice, thereof.

Each such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting and, as may be required, the purposes thereof. Notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given to any Director if he shall sign a written waiver thereof either before or after the time stated therein for such meeting, or if he shall be present at the meeting. Unless limited by law, the Articles of Incorporation, these By-laws or the terms of the notice thereof, any and all business may be transacted at any meeting without the notice thereof having specifically identified the matters to be acted upon.
