This Current Report on Form 8-K relates solely to the 401(k) Savings Plan of Fiserv, Inc. and Its Participating Subsidiaries (the "Plan").
On April 28, 2008, the administrator for the Plan dismissed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("D&T") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Plan. On April 28, 2008, the Plan engaged Wipfli LLP ("Wipfli") as its independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Fiserv, Inc. did not recommend the change in the independent registered public accounting firm for the Plan, but has approved the change.
The reports of D&T on the Plan's financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007 and the subsequent interim period, there have been (i) no disagreements with D&T on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of D&T, would have caused D&T to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports on the financial statements for such years, and (ii) no reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
The Plan has provided a copy of the foregoing statements to D&T and requested that D&T furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") stating whether or not D&T agrees with such statements. A copy of such letter, dated April 29, 2008, is being filed as Exhibit 16 to this Current Report on Form 8K.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007 and the subsequent interim period, the Plan did not consult with Wipfli regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Plan's financial statements, and no written report or oral advice was provided by Wipfli to the Plan that Wipfli concluded was an important factor considered by the Plan in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
