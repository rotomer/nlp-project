Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Trident Investors will make a cash contribution of $205 million to a newly-formed Delaware corporation, Insurance Solutions Holdings, Inc.

The foregoing description of the Stock Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stock Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1, and is incorporated herein by reference. There are representations and warranties contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement which were made by the parties to each other as of specific dates. The assertions embodied in these representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the Stock Purchase Agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating their terms. Moreover, certain representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date because they are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that is different from certain standards generally applicable to shareholders or were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts.

July 2, 2008
Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), a leading provider of information technology services for the financial and insurance industries, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized it to repurchase up to 10 million shares of the company's common stock, approximately 6 percent of its outstanding shares. The company has completed its previous repurchase authorization.
Brookfield, Wis., July 2, 2008
The new authorization was announced in conjunction with the company's agreement to sell a majority stake in its Insurance businesses to Stone Point Capital [see related announcement, "Fiserv Agrees to Sell Majority Interest in its Insurance Business"]. The company expects to receive approximately $510 million in net after-tax proceeds from that sale.
"We continue to view share repurchase as an important element in building shareholder value through capital allocation," said Jeffery Yabuki, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fiserv. "Our strong free cash flow combined with significant proceeds from dispositions in 2008 allows us to meet our debt commitments and to repurchase shares under this new authorization."
Under the new authorization, which does not expire, Fiserv may repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management, subject to its assessment of market conditions and other factors.
