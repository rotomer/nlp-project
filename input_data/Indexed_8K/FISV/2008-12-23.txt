KEESA Amendment
On December 22, 2008, Fiserv, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Amended and Restated Key Executive Employment and Severance Agreement ("Amended KEESA") with each of the Company's named executive officers, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to make changes required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 409A"). To comply with Section 409A, the Amended KEESAs require a six-month delay of post-termination payments and benefits (other than payments to cover employment taxes due on such amounts) in the event that the named executive officer is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control of the Company. The Amended KEESAs contain other provisions designed to comply with Section 409A, including defining when a "Separation from Service" has occurred for purposes of receiving any severance payments or benefits under the Amended KEESA. The Amended KEESAs also clarify the definition of "Accrued Benefits" by creating a separate defined term "Prorated Bonus" for purposes of calculating the named executive officer's severance compensation in connection with a termination without cause, resignation for good reason, death, disability or retirement following a change in control. In addition, the Amended KEESAs clarify how health, life and disability benefits will or may be continued following termination in accordance with Section 409A. The Amended KEESAs do not increase the amounts payable to the named executive officers in connection with a change in control of the Company or a subsequent qualifying termination event as compared to the Key Executive Employment and Severance Agreement previously in effect.
This summary of the Amended KEESAs is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Amended KEESA and to Mr. Yabuki's Amended KEESA which are filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, with this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Amended Employment Agreements
On December 22, 2008, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement ("Amended Employment Agreement") with each of Jeffery W. Yabuki and Thomas W. Warsop III to make changes required by Section 409A of the Code. To comply with Section 409A, the Amended Employment Agreements require a six-month delay in post-termination payments and benefits (other than payments to cover employment taxes due on such amounts) in the event that Mr. Yabuki or Mr. Warsop is considered a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of a qualifying termination. After the six-month delay, Mr. Warsop's Amended Employment Agreement also states that his severance payment will be made in a lump sum instead of 12 monthly installments. Mr. Yabuki's Amended Employment Agreement provides that any excise tax gross-up payment due on a payment or benefit to be received pursuant to his
Amended Employment Agreement or Amended KEESA will be subject to a six-month delay in the event Mr. Yabuki is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of a qualifying termination. However, if prior to the end of such six-month period, Mr. Yabuki is required to remit the excise tax to the Internal Revenue Service, the Company will reimburse Mr. Yabuki for the gross-up payment attributable to the excise tax payment based on his actual rate of taxation. In addition, Mr. Yabuki's Amended Employment Agreement eliminates certain provisions which are no longer applicable due to the passage of time.
This summary of the Amended Employment Agreements of Messrs. Yabuki and Warsop is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended Employment Agreements which are filed as Exhibit 10.3 and Exhibit 10.4, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into as of December 22, 2008, by and between Fiserv, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Company"), and          (hereinafter referred to as the "Executive").
WHEREAS, the Executive is employed by the Company and/or a subsidiary of the Company (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Employer") in a key executive capacity and the Executive's services are valuable to the conduct of the business of the Company;
WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue to attract and retain dedicated and skilled management employees in a period of industry consolidation, consistent with achieving the best possible value for its shareholders in any change in control of the Company;
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that circumstances may arise in which a change in control of the Company occurs, through acquisition or otherwise, thereby causing a potential conflict of interest between the Company's needs for the Executive to remain focused on the Company's business and for the necessary continuity in management prior to and following a change in control, and the Executive's reasonable personal concerns regarding future employment with the Employer and economic protection in the event of loss of employment as a consequence of a change in control;
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive are desirous that any proposal for a change in control or acquisition of the Company will be considered by the Executive objectively and with reference only to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders;
WHEREAS, the Executive will be in a better position to consider the Company's best interests if the Executive is afforded reasonable economic security, as provided in this Agreement, against altered conditions of employment which could result from any such change in control or acquisition;
WHEREAS, the Executive possesses intimate knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company and has acquired certain confidential information and data with respect to the Company; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires to insure, insofar as possible, that it will continue to have the benefit of the Executive's services and to protect its confidential information and goodwill.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree as follows:

provided further, that
(iii) the shareholders of the Company approve a merger, consolidation or share exchange of the Company with any other corporation or approve the issuance of voting securities of the Company in connection with a merger, consolidation or share exchange of the Company (or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company) pursuant to applicable stock exchange requirements, other than (A) a merger, consolidation or share exchange which would result in the voting securities of the

Good Reason
(i) any breach of this Agreement by the Employer, including specifically any breach by the Employer of the agreements contained in Section 3(b), Section 4, Section 5, or Section 6, other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith that the Employer remedies promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
 
(ii) any reduction in the Executive's base salary, percentage of base salary available as incentive compensation or bonus opportunity or benefits, in each case relative to those most favorable to the Executive in effect at any time during the 180-day period prior to the Change in Control of the Company or, to the extent more favorable to the Executive, those in effect at any time during the Employment Period;
(iii) the removal of the Executive from, or any failure to reelect or reappoint the Executive to, any of the positions held with the Employer on the date of the Change in Control of the Company or any other positions with the Employer to which the Executive shall thereafter be elected, appointed or assigned, except in the event that such removal or failure to reelect or reappoint relates to the termination by the Employer of the Executive's employment for Cause or by reason of disability pursuant to Section 12;
(iv) a good faith determination by the Executive that there has been a material adverse change, without the Executive's written consent, in the Executive's working conditions or status with the Employer relative to the most favorable working conditions or status in effect during the 180-day period prior to the Change in Control of the Company, or, to the extent more favorable to the Executive, those in effect at any time during the Employment Period, including but not limited to (A) a significant change in the nature or scope of the Executive's authority, powers, functions, duties or responsibilities, or (B) a significant reduction in the level of support services, staff, secretarial and other assistance, office space and accoutrements, but in each case excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent event not occurring in bad faith that the Employer remedies within ten (10) days after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;

Person
(n) . The term "Prorated Bonus" shall mean an amount equal to the sum of the following with respect to each contingent bonus or incentive compensation award made to the Executive for all uncompleted periods as of the Termination Date: (i) the value of such award, calculated as if the goals with respect to such award had been attained (at the target level, if applicable), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that have elapsed from the first day of the period to which the award relates to the Termination Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the period to which the award relates (without regard to the Termination Date), reduced by (ii) any amounts previously paid with respect to such award or that will be paid (without regard to this Agreement).
Prorated Bonus
(o) . The term "Retirement" means the cessation of service as an employee of the Company and its Affiliates for any reason other than death, disability (as provided in Section 12), or termination for Cause, if at the time of such cessation of service either (1) the Executive is age 60 and his age plus years of service for the Company and its Affiliates is equal to or greater than 70, or (2) the Executive is age 65 or older.
Retirement
(p) . For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Separation from Service" means the Executive's Termination of Employment, or if the Executive continues to provide services following his or her Termination of Employment, such later date as is considered a separation from service from the Company and its 409A Affiliates within the meaning of Code Section 409A. Specifically, if the Executive continues to provide services to the Company or a 409A Affiliate in a capacity other than as an employee, such shift in status is not automatically a Separation from Service.
Separation from Service
(q) . For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive's "Termination of Employment" shall be presumed to occur when the Company and the Executive reasonably anticipate that no further services will be performed by the Executive for the Company and its 409A Affiliates or that the level of bona fide services the Executive will perform as an employee of the Company and its 409A Affiliates will permanently decrease to no more than 20% of the average level of bona fide services performed by the Executive (whether as an employee or independent contractor) for the Company and its 409A Affiliates over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or such lesser period of services). Whether the Executive has experienced a Termination of Employment shall be determined by the Employer in good faith and consistent with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive takes a leave of absence for purposes of military leave, sick leave or other bona fide reason, the Executive will not be deemed to have experienced a Termination of Employment for the first six (6) months of the leave of absence, or if longer, for so long as the Executive's right to reemployment is provided either by statute or by contract, including this Agreement; if the leave of absence is due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or last for a continuous period of not less than six (6) months, where such impairment causes the Executive to be unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, the leave may be extended by the Employer for up to 29 months without causing a Termination of Employment.
Termination of Employment
provided that
 
(r) . Except as otherwise provided in Section 2(b), Section 10(b), and Section 17(a), the term "Termination Date" means (i) if the Executive's Termination of Employment is by the Executive's death, the date of death; (ii) if the Executive's Termination of Employment is by reason of Retirement, the date of such retirement; (iii) if the Executive's Termination of Employment is by reason of disability pursuant to Section 12, the earlier of 30 days after the Notice of Termination is given or one day prior to the end of the Employment Period; (iv) if the Executive's Termination of Employment is by the Executive voluntarily (other than for Good Reason), the date the Notice of Termination is given; and (v) if the Executive's Termination of Employment is by the Employer (other than by reason of disability pursuant to Section 12) or by the Executive for Good Reason, the earlier of 30 days after the Notice of Termination is given or one day prior to the end of the Employment Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Termination Date
(A) If termination is for Cause pursuant to Section 1(g)(iii) and if the Executive has cured the conduct constituting such Cause as described by the Employer in its Notice of Termination within such 30-day or shorter period, then the Executive's employment hereunder shall continue as if the Employer had not delivered its Notice of Termination.
(B) If the Executive shall in good faith give a Notice of Termination for Good Reason and the Employer notifies the Executive that a dispute exists concerning the termination within the 15-day period following receipt thereof, then the Executive may elect to continue his or her employment during such dispute and the Termination Date shall be determined under this paragraph. If the Executive so elects and it is thereafter determined that Good Reason did exist, the Termination Date shall be the earliest of (1) the date on which the dispute is finally determined, either (x) by mutual written agreement of the parties or (y) in accordance with Section 22, (2) the date of the Executive's death or (3) one day prior to the end of the Employment Period. If the Executive so elects and it is thereafter determined that Good Reason did not exist, then the employment of the Executive hereunder shall continue after such determination as if the Executive had not delivered the Notice of Termination asserting Good Reason and there shall be no Termination Date arising out of such Notice. In either case, this Agreement continues, until the Termination Date, if any, as if the Executive had not delivered the Notice of Termination except that, if it is finally determined that Good Reason did exist, the Executive shall in no case be denied the benefits described in Section 9 (including a Termination Payment) based on events occurring after the Executive delivered his Notice of Termination.
(C) Except as provided in Section 1(q)(B), if the party receiving the Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the termination within the appropriate period following receipt thereof and it is finally determined that the reason asserted in such Notice of Termination did not exist, then (1) if such Notice was delivered by the Executive, the Executive will be deemed to have voluntarily terminated his employment and the Termination Date shall
 
be the earlier of the date 15 days after the Notice of Termination is given or one day prior to the end of the Employment Period and (2) if delivered by the Company, the Company will be deemed to have terminated the Executive other than by reason of death, disability or Cause.
2. .
Termination or Cancellation Prior to Change in Control
(a) Subject to Section 2(b), the Employer and the Executive shall each retain the right to terminate the employment of the Executive at any time prior to a Change in Control of the Company. Subject to Section 2(b), in the event the Executive's employment is terminated prior to a Change in Control of the Company, this Agreement shall be terminated and cancelled and of no further force and effect, and any and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall cease.
(b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change in Control of the Company occurs and if the Executive's employment is terminated (other than a termination due to the Executive's death or as a result of the Executive's disability) during the period of 180 days prior to the date on which the Change in Control of the Company occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control of the Company or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change in Control of the Company, then for all purposes of this Agreement such termination of employment shall be deemed a "Covered Termination," "Notice of Termination" shall be deemed to have been given, and the "Employment Period" shall be deemed to have begun on the date of such termination which shall be deemed to be the "Termination Date" and the date of the Change in Control of the Company for purposes of this Agreement.
3. .
Employment Period; Vesting of Certain Benefits
(a) If a Change in Control of the Company occurs when the Executive is employed by the Employer, the Employer will continue thereafter to employ the Executive during the Employment Period, and the Executive will remain in the employ of the Employer in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Any Termination of Employment during the Employment Period, whether by the Company or the Employer, shall be deemed a termination by the Company for purposes of this Agreement.
(b) If a Change in Control of the Company occurs when the Executive is employed by the Employer, (i) the Company shall cause all restrictions on restricted stock awards made to the Executive prior to the Change in Control of the Company to lapse such that the Executive is fully and immediately vested in the Executive's restricted stock upon such a Change in Control of the Company; and (ii) the Company shall cause all stock options granted to the Executive prior to the Change in Control of the Company pursuant to the Company's stock option plan(s) to be fully and immediately vested upon such a Change in Control of the Company.
 
4. . During the Employment Period, the Executive shall, in the same capacities and positions held by the Executive at the time of the Change in Control of the Company or in such other capacities and positions as may be agreed to by the Employer and the Executive in writing, devote the Executive's best efforts and all of the Executive's business time, attention and skill to the business and affairs of the Employer, as such business and affairs now exist and as they may hereafter be conducted; the Executive shall be entitled (a) to serve as director of other corporations and (b) to devote time to personal and financial activities, in each case so long as such activities do not materially affect the Executive's ability to perform the Executive's duties hereunder.
Duties

Compensation
(a) The Executive shall receive, at reasonable intervals (but not less often than monthly) and in accordance with such standard policies as may be in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company, an annual base salary in cash equivalent of not less than twelve times the Executive's highest monthly base salary for the twelve-month period immediately preceding the month in which the Change in Control of the Company occurs or, if higher, an annual base salary at the rate in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company (which base salary shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Executive and subject to any irrevocable deferral election then in effect, include the current receipt by the Executive of any amounts which, prior to the Change in Control of the Company, the Executive had elected to defer, whether such compensation is deferred under Section 401(k) of the Code or otherwise), subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided in Section 6 (such salary amount as adjusted upward from time to time is hereafter referred to as the "Annual Base Salary").
(b) The Executive shall receive fringe benefits at least equal in value to the highest value of such benefits provided for the Executive at any time during the 180-day period immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company or, if more favorable to the Executive, those provided generally at any time during the Employment Period to any executives of the Employer of comparable status and position to the Executive; and shall be reimbursed, at such intervals and in accordance with such standard policies that are most favorable to the Executive that were in effect at any time during the 180-day period immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company, for any and all monies advanced in connection with the Executive's employment for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the Executive on behalf of the Employer, including travel expenses.
(c) The Executive and/or the Executive's family, as the case may be, shall be included, to the extent eligible thereunder (which eligibility shall not be conditioned on the Executive's salary grade or on any other requirement which excludes persons of comparable status to the Executive unless such exclusion was in effect for such plan or an equivalent plan at any time during the 180-day period immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company), in any and all plans providing benefits for the Employer's salaried employees in general, including but not limited to group life insurance, hospitalization, medical, dental, profit sharing and stock bonus plans; , (i) in no event shall the aggregate level of benefits under such plans in which the Executive is included be less than the aggregate level of benefits under plans of the Employer of the type referred to in this Section 5(c) in which the Executive was participating at any time during the 180-day period immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company
provided, that
 
and (ii) in no event shall the aggregate level of benefits under such plans be less than the aggregate level of benefits under plans of the type referred to in this Section 5(c) provided at any time after the Change in Control of the Company to any executive of the Employer of comparable status and position to the Executive.
(d) The Executive shall annually be entitled to not less than the amount of paid vacation and not fewer than the highest number of paid holidays to which the Executive was entitled annually at any time during the 180-day period immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company or such greater amount of paid vacation and number of paid holidays as may be made available annually to other executives of the Employer of comparable status and position to the Executive at any time during the Employment Period.
(e) The Executive shall be included in all plans providing additional benefits to executives of the Employer of comparable status and position to the Executive, including but not limited to deferred compensation, split-dollar life insurance, supplemental retirement, stock option, stock appreciation, stock bonus and similar or comparable plans; , (i) in no event shall the aggregate level of benefits under such plans be less than the highest aggregate level of benefits under plans of the Employer of the type referred to in this Section 5(e) in which the Executive was participating at any time during the 180-day period immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company; (ii) in no event shall the aggregate level of benefits under such plans be less than the aggregate levels of benefits under plans of the type referred to in this Section 5(e) provided at any time after the Change in Control of the Company to any executive of the Employer comparable in status and position to the Executive; and (iii) the Employer's obligation to include the Executive in bonus or incentive compensation plans shall be determined by Section 5(f).
provided, that
(f) To assure that the Executive will have an opportunity to earn incentive compensation after a Change in Control of the Company, the Executive shall be included in a bonus plan of the Employer which shall satisfy the standards described below (such plan, the "Bonus Plan"). Bonuses under the Bonus Plan shall be payable with respect to achieving such financial or other goals reasonably related to the business of the Employer as the Employer shall establish (the "Goals"), all of which Goals shall be attainable, prior to the end of the Employment Period, with approximately the same degree of probability as the most attainable goals under the Employer's bonus plan or plans as in effect at any time during the 180-day period immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company (whether one or more, the "Company Bonus Plan") and in view of the Employer's existing and projected financial and business circumstances applicable at the time. The amount of the bonus (the "Bonus Amount") that the Executive is eligible to earn under the Bonus Plan shall be no less than the amount of the Executive's maximum award provided in such Company Bonus Plan (such bonus amount herein referred to as the "Targeted Bonus"), and in the event the Goals are not achieved such that the entire Targeted Bonus is not payable, the Bonus Plan shall provide for a payment of a Bonus Amount equal to a portion of the Targeted Bonus reasonably related to that portion of the Goals which were achieved. Payment of the Bonus Amount shall not be affected by any circumstance occurring subsequent to the end of the Employment Period, including the Executive's Termination of Employment.
 
6. . During the Employment Period, the Board of Directors of the Company (or an appropriate committee thereof) will consider and appraise, at least annually, the contributions of the Executive to the Company, and in accordance with the Company's practice prior to the Change in Control of the Company, due consideration shall be given to the upward adjustment of the Executive's Annual Base Salary, at least annually, (a) commensurate with increases generally given to other executives of the Company of comparable status and position to the Executive, and (b) as the scope of the Company's operations or the Executive's duties expand.
Annual Compensation Adjustments
7. . If there is a Covered Termination for Cause or due to the Executive's voluntarily terminating his employment other than for Good Reason (any such terminations to be subject to the procedures set forth in Section 13), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive only Accrued Benefits.
Termination For Cause or Without Good Reason
8. . If there is a Covered Termination by the Executive for Good Reason, or by the Company other than by reason of (i) death, (ii) disability pursuant to Section 12, or (iii) Cause (any such terminations to be subject to the procedures set forth in Section 13), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive, and the Company shall promptly pay, Accrued Benefits and, in lieu of further base salary for periods following the Termination Date, as liquidated damages and additional severance pay and in consideration of the covenant of the Executive set forth in Section 14(a), the Termination Payment and the Prorated Bonus.
Termination Giving Rise to a Termination Payment
9. .
Payments Upon Termination
(a) .
Termination Payment
(i) Subject to Section 9(a)(iii), the "Termination Payment" shall be an amount equal to the Annual Cash Compensation times two (2).
(ii) The Termination Payment and the Prorated Bonus shall be paid to the Executive in cash equivalent on the first day of the seventh month following the month in which the Executive's Separation from Service occurs, without interest thereon; if on the date of the Executive's Separation from Service, neither the Company nor any other entity that is considered a "service recipient" with respect to the Executive within the meaning of Code Section 409A has any stock which is publicly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-1(m)) or otherwise, then the Termination Payment and the Prorated Bonus shall be paid to the Executive in cash equivalent within ten (10) business days after the Termination Date, or if the Executive's Termination Date is pursuant to Section 2(b), within ten (10) business days after the date of the Change in Control of the Company (as defined without reference to Section 2(b)). Such lump sum payment shall not be reduced by any present value or similar factor, and the Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of the Termination Payment and Prorated Bonus by securing other employment or otherwise, nor will such Termination Payment and Prorated Bonus be reduced by reason of the Executive securing other employment or for any other reason. The Termination Payment and Prorated Bonus shall be in lieu of, and acceptance by the Executive of the Termination
provided that,
 
Payment and Prorated Bonus shall constitute the Executive's release of any rights of the Executive to, any other cash severance payments under any Company severance policy, practice or agreement.
(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any portion of the Termination Payment or any other payment under this Agreement, or under any other agreement with or plan of the Employer (in the aggregate, "Total Payments"), would constitute an "excess parachute payment," then the Executive shall have the option to have the Total Payments to be made to the Executive reduced such that the value of the aggregate Total Payments that the Executive is entitled to receive shall be One Dollar ($1) less than the maximum amount which the Executive may receive without becoming subject to the tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "excess parachute payment" and "parachute payments" shall have the meanings assigned to them in Section 280G of the Code and such "parachute payments" shall be valued as provided therein. Present value for purposes of this Agreement shall be calculated in accordance with Section 1274(b)(2) of the Code. Within 40 days following a Covered Termination or notice by one party to the other of its belief that there is a payment or benefit due the Executive that will result in an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Code, the Executive and the Company, at the Company's expense, shall obtain the opinion (which need not be unqualified) of nationally recognized tax counsel ("National Tax Counsel") selected by the Company's independent auditors and reasonably acceptable to the Executive (which may be regular outside counsel to the Company), which opinion sets forth (A) the amount of the Base Period Income, (B) the amount and present value of Total Payments, (C) the amount and present value of any excess parachute payments determined without regard to any reduction of Total Payments pursuant to this Section 9(a)(ii) and (D) the net after-tax proceeds to the Executive, taking into account the tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code if (x) the Total Payments were reduced in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 9(a)(iii) or (y) the Total Payments were not so reduced. As used in this Agreement, the term "Base Period Income" means an amount equal to the Executive's "annualized includable compensation for the base period" as defined in Section 280G(d)(1) of the Code. For purposes of such opinion, the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Section 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code, which determination shall be evidenced in a certificate of such auditors addressed to the Company and the Executive. The opinion of National Tax Counsel shall be addressed to the Company and the Executive and shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. If such National Tax Counsel opinion determines that there would be an excess parachute payment, then, at the Executive's sole discretion, the Termination Payment hereunder or any other payment or benefit determined by such counsel to be includable in Total Payments may be reduced or eliminated as specified by the Executive in writing delivered to the Company within thirty days of his receipt of such opinion so that under the bases of calculations set forth in such opinion there will be no excess parachute payment. If such National Tax Counsel so requests in connection with the opinion required by this Section 9(a), the Executive and the Company shall obtain, at the Company's expense, and the National Tax Counsel may rely on, the advice of a firm of recognized executive compensation consultants as to the reasonableness of any item of compensation to be received by the Executive solely with respect to its status under Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
 
(iv) The Company agrees to bear all costs associated with, and to indemnify and hold harmless, the National Tax Counsel of and from any and all claims, damages, and expenses resulting from or relating to its determinations pursuant to this Section 9(a), except for claims, damages or expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such firm.
(b) . If there is a Covered Termination and the Executive is entitled to Accrued Benefits, the Termination Payment and the Prorated Bonus, then the Company shall provide to the Executive the following additional benefits:
Additional Benefits
(i) The Executive shall receive, until the end of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Executive's Separation from Service occurs, at the expense of the Company, outplacement services, on an individualized basis at a level of service commensurate with the Executive's status with the Company immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control of the Company (or, if higher, immediately prior to the Executive's Termination of Employment), provided by a nationally recognized executive placement firm selected by the Company; the cost to the Company of such services shall not exceed 10% of the Executive's Annual Base Salary.
provided that
(ii) Until the earlier of the end of the Employment Period or such time as the Executive has obtained new employment and is covered by benefits which in the aggregate are at least equal in value to the following benefits:
(A) The Executive shall continue to be covered, at the expense of the Company, by the same or equivalent hospitalization, medical and dental coverage as was required hereunder with respect to the Executive immediately prior to the date the Notice of Termination is given. If, following the end of the COBRA continuation period, such hospitalization, medical or dental coverage is provided under a health plan that is subject to Section 105(h) of the Code, then benefits payable under such health plan shall comply with the requirements of Treasury regulation section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) and, if necessary, the Company shall amend such health plan to comply therewith. If, following the end of the COBRA continuation period, the Company's health plan does not permit continued coverage by Executive and his covered dependents, then the Company may satisfy its obligations hereunder by purchasing an individual insurance policy on Executive's and his covered dependents' behalf or enrolling Executive and his covered dependents in a state-sponsored high risk health pool if individual insurance is not able to be obtained, all at the Company's expense.
(B) If the Executive elects to convert his group life insurance to an individual policy, then the Company shall pay the Executive's premiums for such conversion policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive's Termination Payment is delayed for six (6) months following his Separation from Service, then during the first six (6) months following
 
the Executive's Separation from Service, the Executive shall pay the conversion premiums and after the end of such six (6) month period, the Company shall make a cash equivalent payment to the Executive equal to the aggregate premiums paid by the Executive for such coverage, without interest thereon.
If the Executive is entitled to the Termination Payment pursuant to Section 2(b), then within ten (10) days following the Change in Control of the Company (determined without regard to Section 2(b)), the Company shall reimburse the Executive for any COBRA premiums the Executive paid for his hospitalization, medical and dental coverage under COBRA from the Executive's Termination Date through the date of the Change in Control of the Company (determined without regard to Section 2(b)).
(iii) The Company shall reimburse the Executive for up to $15,000 in the aggregate of fees and expenses of consultants and/or legal or accounting advisors engaged by the Executive to advise the Executive as to matters relating to the computation of benefits due and payable under this Section 9.
10. .
Death
(a) Except as provided in Section 10(b), in the event of a Covered Termination due to the Executive's death, the Executive's estate, heirs and beneficiaries shall receive all the Executive's Accrued Benefits through the Termination Date and, no later than 90 days after the Executive's death, the Prorated Bonus.
(b) In the event the Executive dies after a Notice of Termination is given (i) by the Company or (ii) by the Executive for Good Reason, the Executive's estate, heirs and beneficiaries shall be entitled to the benefits described in Section 10(a) and, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to such Termination Payment as the Executive would have been entitled to had the Executive lived, except that the Termination Payment shall be paid within 90 days following the date of the Executive's death. For purposes of this Section 10(b), the Termination Date shall be the earlier of 30 days following the giving of the Notice of Termination, subject to extension pursuant to Section 1(m), or one day prior to the end of the Employment Period.
11. . If, during the Employment Period, the Executive and the Employer shall execute an agreement providing for the early retirement of the Executive from the Employer, or the Executive shall otherwise give notice that he is voluntarily choosing to retire early from the Employer, the Executive shall receive Accrued Benefits through the Termination Date; if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Executive for Good Reason or by the Company other than by reason of death, disability or Cause and the Executive also, in connection with such termination, elects voluntary early retirement, then the Executive shall also be entitled to receive a Termination Payment and the Prorated Bonus pursuant to Section 8.
Retirement
provided that
12. . If, during the Employment Period, as a result of the Executive's disability due to physical or mental illness or injury (regardless of whether such illness or injury is job-related), the Executive shall have been absent from the
Termination for Disability
 
Executive's duties hereunder on a full-time basis for a period of six (6) consecutive months and, within 30 days after the Company notifies the Executive in writing that it intends to terminate the Executive's employment (which notice shall not constitute the Notice of Termination contemplated below), the Executive shall not have returned to the performance of the Executive's duties hereunder on a full-time basis, the Company may terminate the Executive's employment for purposes of this Agreement pursuant to a Notice of Termination given in accordance with Section 13. If the Executive's employment is terminated on account of the Executive's disability in accordance with this Section, the Executive shall receive Accrued Benefits through the Termination Date and, no later than 90 days after the Executive's Separation from Service, the Prorated Bonus, and shall remain eligible for all benefits provided by any long term disability programs of the Employer in effect at the time of such termination.
13. . Any Covered Termination by the Company or the Executive (other than a termination of the Executive's employment that is a Covered Termination by virtue of Section 2(b)) shall be communicated by a written notice of termination ("Notice of Termination") to the Executive, if such Notice is given by the Company, and to the Company, if such Notice is given by the Executive, all in accordance with the following procedures and those set forth in Section 24:
Termination Notice and Procedure
(a) If such termination is for disability, Cause or Good Reason, the Notice of Termination shall indicate in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances alleged to provide a basis for such termination.
(b) Any Notice of Termination by the Company shall have been approved, prior to the giving thereof to the Executive, by a resolution duly adopted by a majority of the directors of the Company (or any successor corporation) then in office.
(c) If the Notice is given by the Executive for Good Reason, the Executive may cease performing his duties hereunder on or after the date 15 days after the delivery of Notice of Termination and shall in any event cease employment on the Termination Date. If the Notice is given by the Company, then the Executive may cease performing his duties hereunder on the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination, subject to the Executive's rights hereunder.
(d) The Executive shall have 30 days, or such longer period as the Company may determine to be appropriate, to cure any conduct or act, if curable, alleged to provide grounds for termination of the Executive's employment for Cause under this Agreement pursuant to Section 1(g)(iii).
(e) The recipient of any Notice of Termination shall personally deliver or mail in accordance with Section 24 written notice of any dispute relating to such Notice of Termination to the party giving such Notice within 15 days after receipt thereof; if the Executive's conduct or act alleged to provide grounds for termination by the Company for Cause is curable, then such period shall be 30 days. After the expiration of such period, the contents of the Notice of Termination shall become final and not subject to dispute.
provided, however, that

Further Obligations of the Executive
(a) . The Executive agrees that, in the event of any Covered Termination where the Executive is entitled to Accrued Benefits and the Termination Payment, the Executive shall not, for a period expiring six (6) months after the Termination Date, without the prior written approval of the Company's Board of Directors, participate in the management of, be employed by or own any business enterprise at a location within the United States that engages in substantial competition with the Company or its subsidiaries, where such enterprise's revenues from any competitive activities amount to 10% or more of such enterprise's net revenues and sales for its most recently completed fiscal year; nothing in this Section 14(a) shall prohibit the Executive from owning stock or other securities of a competitor amounting to less than five percent of the outstanding capital stock of such competitor.
Competition
provided, however, that
(b) . During and following the Executive's employment by the Company, the Executive shall hold in confidence and not directly or indirectly disclose or use or copy or make lists of any confidential information or proprietary data of the Company (including that of the Employer), except to the extent authorized in writing by the Board of Directors of the Company or required by any court or administrative agency, other than to an employee of the Company or a person to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance by the Executive of duties as an executive of the Company. Confidential information shall not include any information known generally to the public or any information of a type not otherwise considered confidential by persons engaged in the same business or a business similar to that of the Company. All records, files, documents and materials, or copies thereof, relating to the business of the Company which the Executive shall prepare, or use, or come into contact with, shall be and remain the sole property of the Company and shall be promptly returned to the Company upon termination of employment with the Company.
Confidentiality
(c) . The Executive agrees that, in the event of any Covered Termination where the Executive is entitled to Accrued Benefits, the Termination Payment and the Prorated Bonus, the Executive shall not, for a period expiring two years after the Termination Date, without the prior written approval of the Company's Board of Directors, hire or solicit for employment any person who is or was employed by the Company during the then immediately preceding 12 months, other than pursuant to a general published solicitation of employment.
No Solicitation
15. . If, after a Change in Control of the Company, (a) a dispute arises with respect to the enforcement of the Executive's rights under this Agreement or (b) any legal or arbitration proceeding shall be brought to enforce or interpret any provision contained herein or to recover damages for breach hereof, in either case so long as the Executive is not acting in bad faith, then the Company shall reimburse the Executive for any reasonable attorneys' fees and necessary costs and disbursements incurred as a result of the dispute, legal or arbitration proceeding ("Expenses"), and prejudgment interest on any money judgment or arbitration award obtained by the Executive calculated at the rate of interest announced by The Bank of New York, from time to time at its prime or base lending rate from the date that payments to him or her should have been made under this Agreement. Within ten (10) days after the Executive's written request therefor (but in no event later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such Expense is incurred), the Company shall reimburse the Executive, or such other person or entity as the Executive may designate in writing to the Company, the Executive's reasonable Expenses.
Expenses and Interest
 
16. . The Company's obligation during and after the Employment Period to pay the Executive the amounts and to make the benefit and other arrangements provided herein shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company may have against him or anyone else. Except as provided in Section 15, all amounts payable by the Company hereunder shall be paid without notice or demand. Each and every payment made hereunder by the Company shall be final, and the Company will not seek to recover all or any part of such payment from the Executive, or from whomsoever may be entitled thereto, for any reason whatsoever.
Payment Obligations Absolute
17. .
Successors
(a) If the Company sells, assigns or transfers all or substantially all of its business and assets to any Person or if the Company merges into or consolidates or otherwise combines (where the Company does not survive such combination) with any Person (any such event, a "Sale of Business"), then the Company shall assign all of its right, title and interest in this Agreement as of the date of such event to such Person, and the Company shall cause such Person, by written agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform from and after the date of such assignment all of the terms, conditions and provisions imposed by this Agreement upon the Company. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effective date of such Sale of Business shall be a breach of this Agreement constituting "Good Reason" hereunder, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing the date upon which such Sale of Business becomes effective shall be deemed the Termination Date. In case of such assignment by the Company and of assumption and agreement by such Person, as used in this Agreement, "Company" shall thereafter mean such Person which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 17 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law, and this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, such Person. The Executive shall, in his or her discretion, be entitled to proceed against any or all of such Persons, any Person which theretofore was such a successor to the Company and the Company (as so defined) in any action to enforce any rights of the Executive hereunder. Except as provided in this Section 17(a), this Agreement shall not be assignable by the Company. This Agreement shall not be terminated by the voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Company.
(b) This Agreement and all rights of the Executive shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs and beneficiaries. All amounts payable to the Executive under Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15 if the Executive had lived shall be paid, in the event of the Executive's death, to the Executive's estate, heirs and representatives; the foregoing shall not be construed to modify any terms of any benefit plan of the Employer, as such terms are in effect on the date of the Change in Control of the Company, that expressly govern benefits under such plan in the event of the Executive's death.
provided, however, that
18. . The provisions of this Agreement shall be regarded as divisible, and if any of said provisions or any part hereof are declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity and enforceability of the remainder of such provisions or parts hereof and the applicability thereof shall not be affected thereby.
Severability
 
19. . This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and the Executive hereby waives all rights under, any prior or other agreement or understanding between the parties with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended or modified at any time except by written instrument executed by the Company and the Executive.
Contents of Agreement; Waiver of Rights; Amendment
20. . The Company shall be entitled to withhold from amounts to be paid to the Executive hereunder any federal, state or local withholding or other taxes or charges which it is from time to time required to withhold; the amount so withheld shall not exceed the minimum amount required to be withheld by law unless otherwise elected by the Executive in writing. In addition, if prior to the date of payment of the Termination Payment or Prorated Bonus hereunder, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Sections 3101, 3121(a) and 3121(v)(2) of the Code, where applicable, becomes due with respect to any payment or benefit to be provided hereunder, the Company may provide for an immediate payment of the amount needed to pay the Executive's portion of such tax (plus an amount equal to the taxes that will be due on such amount) and the Executive's Termination Payment or Prorated Bonus shall be reduced accordingly. The Company shall be entitled to rely on an opinion of the National Tax Counsel if any question as to the amount or requirement of any such withholding shall arise.
Withholding
provided that
21. . No party shall be considered as being responsible for the drafting of this Agreement for the purpose of applying any rule construing ambiguities against the drafter or otherwise. No draft of this Agreement shall be taken into account in construing this Agreement. Any provision of this Agreement which requires an agreement in writing shall be deemed to require that the writing in question be signed by the Executive and an authorized representative of the Company.
Certain Rules of Construction
22. . This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin, without reference to conflict of law principles thereof. Any dispute arising out of this Agreement shall, at the Executive's election, be determined by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect (in which case both parties shall be bound by the arbitration award) or by litigation. Whether the dispute is to be settled by arbitration or litigation, the venue for the arbitration or litigation shall be Milwaukee, Wisconsin or, at the Executive's election, if the Executive is not then residing or working in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin metropolitan area, in the judicial district encompassing the city in which the Executive resides; , if the Executive is not then residing in the United States, the election of the Executive with respect to such venue shall be either Milwaukee, Wisconsin or in the judicial district encompassing that city in the United States among the thirty cities having the largest population (as determined by the most recent United States Census data available at the Termination Date) which is closest to the Executive's residence. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction in each trial court in the selected venue having subject matter jurisdiction notwithstanding their residence or situs, and each party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided hereunder for the giving of notices.

Additional Section 409A Provisions
(a) If, after the date of a Change in Control of the Company, any payment amount or the value of any benefit under this Agreement is required to be included in the Executive's income prior to the date such amount is actually paid or the benefit provided as a result of the failure of this Agreement (or any other arrangement that is required to be aggregated with this Agreement under Code Section 409A) to comply with Code Section 409A, then the Executive shall receive a distribution, in a lump sum, within 90 days after the date it is finally determined that the Agreement (or such other arrangement that is required to be aggregated with this Agreement) fails to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; such distribution shall equal the amount required to be included in the Executive's income as a result of such failure and shall reduce the amount of payments or benefits otherwise due hereunder.
(b) The Company and the Executive intend the terms of this Agreement to be in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. The Company does not guarantee the tax treatment or tax consequences associated with any payment or benefit, including but not limited to consequences related to Section 409A of the Code. To the maximum extent permissible, any ambiguous terms of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner that avoids a violation of Section 409A of the Code.
(c) If the Executive believes he is entitled to a payment or benefit pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that was not timely paid or provided, and such payment or benefit is considered deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Executive acknowledges that to avoid an additional tax on such payment or benefit pursuant to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, the Executive must make a reasonable, good faith effort to collect such payment or benefit after the latest date upon which the payment could have been timely made or benefit timely provided without violating Section 409A of the Code, and if not paid or provided, must take further enforcement measures after such latest date.
no later than 90 days

Exhibit 10.2
THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into as of the 22nd day of December, 2008, by and between Fiserv, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Company"), and Jeffery W. Yabuki (hereinafter referred to as the "Executive").
WHEREAS, the Executive is employed by the Company and/or a subsidiary of the Company (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Employer") in a key executive capacity and the Executive's services are valuable to the conduct of the business of the Company;
WHEREAS, the Company desires to continue to attract and retain dedicated and skilled management employees in a period of industry consolidation, consistent with achieving the best possible value for its shareholders in any change in control of the Company;
WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that circumstances may arise in which a change in control of the Company occurs, through acquisition or otherwise, thereby causing a potential conflict of interest between the Company's needs for the Executive to remain focused on the Company's business and for the necessary continuity in management prior to and following a change in control, and the Executive's reasonable personal concerns regarding future employment with the Employer and economic protection in the event of loss of employment as a consequence of a change in control;
WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive are desirous that any proposal for a change in control or acquisition of the Company will be considered by the Executive objectively and with reference only to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders;
WHEREAS, the Executive will be in a better position to consider the Company's best interests if the Executive is afforded reasonable economic security, as provided in this Agreement, against altered conditions of employment which could result from any such change in control or acquisition;
WHEREAS, the Executive possesses intimate knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company and has acquired certain confidential information and data with respect to the Company; and
WHEREAS, the Company desires to insure, insofar as possible, that it will continue to have the benefit of the Executive's services and to protect its confidential information and goodwill.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto mutually covenant and agree as follows:

If the Executive so elects and it is thereafter determined that Good Reason did not exist, then the employment of the Executive hereunder shall continue after such determination as if the Executive had not delivered the Notice of Termination asserting Good Reason and there shall be no Termination Date arising out of such Notice. In either case, this Agreement continues, until the Termination Date, if any, as if the Executive had not delivered the Notice of Termination except that, if it is finally determined that Good Reason did exist, the Executive shall in no case be denied the benefits described in Section 9 (including a Termination Payment) based on events occurring after the Executive delivered his Notice of Termination.
(C) Except as provided in Section 1(q)(B), if the party receiving the Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the termination within the appropriate period following receipt thereof and it is finally determined that the reason asserted in such Notice of Termination did not exist, then (1) if such Notice was delivered by the Executive, the Executive will be deemed to have voluntarily terminated his employment and the Termination Date shall
 
be the earlier of the date 15 days after the Notice of Termination is given or one day prior to the end of the Employment Period and (2) if delivered by the Company, the Company will be deemed to have terminated the Executive other than by reason of death, disability or Cause.

Within 40 days following a Covered Termination or notice by one party to the other of its belief that there is a payment or benefit due the Executive that will result in an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Code, the Executive and the Company, at the Company's expense, shall obtain the opinion (which need not be unqualified) of nationally recognized tax counsel ("National Tax Counsel") selected by the Company's independent auditors and reasonably acceptable to the Executive (which may be regular outside counsel to the Company), which opinion sets forth (A) the amount of the Base Period Income, (B) the amount and present value of Total Payments, (C) the amount and present value of any excess parachute payments determined without regard to any reduction of Total Payments pursuant to this Section 9(a)(ii) and (D) the net after-tax proceeds to the Executive, taking into account the tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code if (x) the Total Payments were reduced in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 9(a)(iii) or (y) the Total Payments were not so reduced. As used in this Agreement, the term "Base Period Income" means an amount equal to the Executive's "annualized includable compensation for the base period" as defined in Section 280G(d)(1) of the Code. For purposes of such opinion, the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Section 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code, which determination shall be evidenced in a certificate of such auditors addressed to the Company and the Executive. The opinion of National Tax Counsel shall be addressed to the Company and the Executive and shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. If such National Tax Counsel opinion determines that there would be an excess parachute payment, then, at the Executive's sole discretion, the Termination Payment hereunder or any other payment or benefit determined by such counsel to be includable in Total Payments may be reduced or eliminated as specified by the Executive in writing delivered to the Company within thirty days of his receipt of such opinion so that under the bases of calculations set forth in such opinion there will be no excess parachute payment. If such National Tax Counsel so requests in connection with the opinion required by this Section 9(a), the Executive and the Company shall obtain, at the Company's expense, and the National Tax Counsel may rely on, the advice of a firm of recognized executive compensation consultants as to the reasonableness of any item of compensation to be received by the Executive solely with respect to its status under Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
 
(iv) The Company agrees to bear all costs associated with, and to indemnify and hold harmless, the National Tax Counsel of and from any and all claims, damages, and expenses resulting from or relating to its determinations pursuant to this Section 9(a), except for claims, damages or expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such firm.
(b) . If there is a Covered Termination and the Executive is entitled to Accrued Benefits, the Termination Payment and the Prorated Bonus, then the Company shall provide to the Executive the following additional benefits:
Additional Benefits
(i) The Executive shall receive, until the end of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Executive's Separation from Service occurs, at the expense of the Company, outplacement services, on an individualized basis at a level of service commensurate with the Executive's status with the Company immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control of the Company (or, if higher, immediately prior to the Executive's Termination of Employment), provided by a nationally recognized executive placement firm selected by the Company; the cost to the Company of such services shall not exceed 10% of the Executive's Annual Base Salary.
provided that
(ii) Until the earlier of the end of the Employment Period or such time as the Executive has obtained new employment and is covered by benefits which in the aggregate are at least equal in value to the following benefits:
(A) The Executive shall continue to be covered, at the expense of the Company, by the same or equivalent hospitalization, medical and dental coverage as was required hereunder with respect to the Executive immediately prior to the date the Notice of Termination is given. If, following the end of the COBRA continuation period, such hospitalization, medical or dental coverage is provided under a health plan that is subject to Section 105(h) of the Code, then benefits payable under such health plan shall comply with the requirements of Treasury regulation section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) and, if necessary, the Company shall amend such health plan to comply therewith. If, following the end of the COBRA continuation period, the Company's health plan does not permit continued coverage by Executive and his covered dependents, then the Company may satisfy its obligations hereunder by purchasing an individual insurance policy on Executive's and his covered dependents' behalf or enrolling Executive and his covered dependents in a state-sponsored high risk health pool if individual insurance is not able to be obtained, all at the Company's expense.
(B) If the Executive elects to convert his group life insurance to an individual policy, then the Company shall pay the Executive's premiums for such conversion policies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive's Termination Payment is delayed for six (6) months following his Separation from Service, then during the first six (6) months following
 
the Executive's Separation from Service, the Executive shall pay the conversion premiums and after the end of such six (6) month period, the Company shall make a cash equivalent payment to the Executive equal to the aggregate premiums paid by the Executive for such coverage, without interest thereon.
If the Executive is entitled to the Termination Payment pursuant to Section 2(b), then within ten (10) days following the Change in Control of the Company (determined without regard to Section 2(b)), the Company shall reimburse the Executive for any COBRA premiums the Executive paid for his hospitalization, medical and dental coverage under COBRA from the Executive's Termination Date through the date of the Change in Control of the Company (determined without regard to Section 2(b)).
(iii) The Company shall reimburse the Executive for up to $15,000 in the aggregate of fees and expenses of consultants and/or legal or accounting advisors engaged by the Executive to advise the Executive as to matters relating to the computation of benefits due and payable under this Section 9.
10. .
Death
(a) Except as provided in Section 10(b), in the event of a Covered Termination due to the Executive's death, the Executive's estate, heirs and beneficiaries shall receive all the Executive's Accrued Benefits through the Termination Date and, no later than 90 days after the Executive's death, the Prorated Bonus.
(b) In the event the Executive dies after a Notice of Termination is given (i) by the Company or (ii) by the Executive for Good Reason, the Executive's estate, heirs and beneficiaries shall be entitled to the benefits described in Section 10(a) and, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to such Termination Payment as the Executive would have been entitled to had the Executive lived, except that the Termination Payment shall be paid within 90 days following the date of the Executive's death. For purposes of this Section 10(b), the Termination Date shall be the earlier of 30 days following the giving of the Notice of Termination, subject to extension pursuant to Section 1(m), or one day prior to the end of the Employment Period.
11. . If, during the Employment Period, the Executive and the Employer shall execute an agreement providing for the early retirement of the Executive from the Employer, or the Executive shall otherwise give notice that he is voluntarily choosing to retire early from the Employer, the Executive shall receive Accrued Benefits through the Termination Date; if the Executive's employment is terminated by the Executive for Good Reason or by the Company other than by reason of death, disability or Cause and the Executive also, in connection with such termination, elects voluntary early retirement, then the Executive shall also be entitled to receive a Termination Payment and the Prorated Bonus pursuant to Section 8.
Retirement
provided that
12. . If, during the Employment Period, as a result of the Executive's disability due to physical or mental illness or injury (regardless of whether such illness or injury is job-related), the Executive shall have been absent from the
Termination for Disability
 
Executive's duties hereunder on a full-time basis for a period of six (6) consecutive months and, within 30 days after the Company notifies the Executive in writing that it intends to terminate the Executive's employment (which notice shall not constitute the Notice of Termination contemplated below), the Executive shall not have returned to the performance of the Executive's duties hereunder on a full-time basis, the Company may terminate the Executive's employment for purposes of this Agreement pursuant to a Notice of Termination given in accordance with Section 13. If the Executive's employment is terminated on account of the Executive's disability in accordance with this Section, the Executive shall receive Accrued Benefits through the Termination Date and, no later than 90 days after the Executive's Separation from Service, the Prorated Bonus, and shall remain eligible for all benefits provided by any long term disability programs of the Employer in effect at the time of such termination.
13. . Any Covered Termination by the Company or the Executive (other than a termination of the Executive's employment that is a Covered Termination by virtue of Section 2(b)) shall be communicated by a written notice of termination ("Notice of Termination") to the Executive, if such Notice is given by the Company, and to the Company, if such Notice is given by the Executive, all in accordance with the following procedures and those set forth in Section 24:
Termination Notice and Procedure
(a) If such termination is for disability, Cause or Good Reason, the Notice of Termination shall indicate in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances alleged to provide a basis for such termination.
(b) Any Notice of Termination by the Company shall have been approved, prior to the giving thereof to the Executive, by a resolution duly adopted by a majority of the directors of the Company (or any successor corporation) then in office.
(c) If the Notice is given by the Executive for Good Reason, the Executive may cease performing his duties hereunder on or after the date 15 days after the delivery of Notice of Termination and shall in any event cease employment on the Termination Date. If the Notice is given by the Company, then the Executive may cease performing his duties hereunder on the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination, subject to the Executive's rights hereunder.
(d) The Executive shall have 30 days, or such longer period as the Company may determine to be appropriate, to cure any conduct or act, if curable, alleged to provide grounds for termination of the Executive's employment for Cause under this Agreement pursuant to Section 1(g)(iii).
(e) The recipient of any Notice of Termination shall personally deliver or mail in accordance with Section 24 written notice of any dispute relating to such Notice of Termination to the party giving such Notice within 15 days after receipt thereof; if the Executive's conduct or act alleged to provide grounds for termination by the Company for Cause is curable, then such period shall be 30 days. After the expiration of such period, the contents of the Notice of Termination shall become final and not subject to dispute.
provided, however, that

Competition
provided, however, that
(b) . During and following the Executive's employment by the Company, the Executive shall hold in confidence and not directly or indirectly disclose or use or copy or make lists of any confidential information or proprietary data of the Company (including that of the Employer), except to the extent authorized in writing by the Board of Directors of the Company or required by any court or administrative agency, other than to an employee of the Company or a person to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance by the Executive of duties as an executive of the Company. Confidential information shall not include any information known generally to the public or any information of a type not otherwise considered confidential by persons engaged in the same business or a business similar to that of the Company. All records, files, documents and materials, or copies thereof, relating to the business of the Company which the Executive shall prepare, or use, or come into contact with, shall be and remain the sole property of the Company and shall be promptly returned to the Company upon termination of employment with the Company.
Confidentiality
(c) . The Executive agrees that, in the event of any Covered Termination where the Executive is entitled to Accrued Benefits, the Termination Payment and the Prorated Bonus, the Executive shall not, for a period expiring two years after the Termination Date, without the prior written approval of the Company's Board of Directors, hire or solicit for employment any person who is or was employed by the Company during the then immediately preceding 12 months, other than pursuant to a general published solicitation of employment.
No Solicitation
15. . If, after a Change in Control of the Company, (a) a dispute arises with respect to the enforcement of the Executive's rights under this Agreement or (b) any legal or arbitration proceeding shall be brought to enforce or interpret any provision contained herein or to recover damages for breach hereof, in either case so long as the Executive is not acting in bad faith, then the Company shall reimburse the Executive for any reasonable attorneys' fees and necessary costs and disbursements incurred as a result of the dispute, legal or arbitration proceeding ("Expenses"), and prejudgment interest on any money judgment or arbitration award obtained by the Executive calculated at the rate of interest announced by The Bank of New York, from time to time at its prime or base lending rate from the date that payments to him or her should have been made under this Agreement. Within ten (10) days after the Executive's written request therefor (but in no event later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such Expense is incurred), the Company shall reimburse the Executive, or such other person or entity as the Executive may designate in writing to the Company, the Executive's reasonable Expenses.
Expenses and Interest
 
16. . The Company's obligation during and after the Employment Period to pay the Executive the amounts and to make the benefit and other arrangements provided herein shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company may have against him or anyone else. Except as provided in Section 15, all amounts payable by the Company hereunder shall be paid without notice or demand. Each and every payment made hereunder by the Company shall be final, and the Company will not seek to recover all or any part of such payment from the Executive, or from whomsoever may be entitled thereto, for any reason whatsoever.
Payment Obligations Absolute
17. .
Successors
(a) If the Company sells, assigns or transfers all or substantially all of its business and assets to any Person or if the Company merges into or consolidates or otherwise combines (where the Company does not survive such combination) with any Person (any such event, a "Sale of Business"), then the Company shall assign all of its right, title and interest in this Agreement as of the date of such event to such Person, and the Company shall cause such Person, by written agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform from and after the date of such assignment all of the terms, conditions and provisions imposed by this Agreement upon the Company. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effective date of such Sale of Business shall be a breach of this Agreement constituting "Good Reason" hereunder, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing the date upon which such Sale of Business becomes effective shall be deemed the Termination Date. In case of such assignment by the Company and of assumption and agreement by such Person, as used in this Agreement, "Company" shall thereafter mean such Person which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 17 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law, and this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, such Person. The Executive shall, in his or her discretion, be entitled to proceed against any or all of such Persons, any Person which theretofore was such a successor to the Company and the Company (as so defined) in any action to enforce any rights of the Executive hereunder. Except as provided in this Section 17(a), this Agreement shall not be assignable by the Company. This Agreement shall not be terminated by the voluntary or involuntary dissolution of the Company.
(b) This Agreement and all rights of the Executive shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs and beneficiaries. All amounts payable to the Executive under Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15 if the Executive had lived shall be paid, in the event of the Executive's death, to the Executive's estate, heirs and representatives; the foregoing shall not be construed to modify any terms of any benefit plan of the Employer, as such terms are in effect on the date of the Change in Control of the Company, that expressly govern benefits under such plan in the event of the Executive's death.
provided, however, that
18. . The provisions of this Agreement shall be regarded as divisible, and if any of said provisions or any part hereof are declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity and enforceability of the remainder of such provisions or parts hereof and the applicability thereof shall not be affected thereby.
Severability
 
19. . This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and the Executive hereby waives all rights under, any prior or other agreement or understanding between the parties with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended or modified at any time except by written instrument executed by the Company and the Executive.
Contents of Agreement; Waiver of Rights; Amendment
20. . The Company shall be entitled to withhold from amounts to be paid to the Executive hereunder any federal, state or local withholding or other taxes or charges which it is from time to time required to withhold; the amount so withheld shall not exceed the minimum amount required to be withheld by law unless otherwise elected by the Executive in writing. In addition, if prior to the date of payment of the Termination Payment or Prorated Bonus hereunder, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Sections 3101, 3121(a) and 3121(v)(2) of the Code, where applicable, becomes due with respect to any payment or benefit to be provided hereunder, the Company may provide for an immediate payment of the amount needed to pay the Executive's portion of such tax (plus an amount equal to the taxes that will be due on such amount) and the Executive's Termination Payment or Prorated Bonus shall be reduced accordingly. The Company shall be entitled to rely on an opinion of the National Tax Counsel if any question as to the amount or requirement of any such withholding shall arise.
Withholding
provided that
21. . No party shall be considered as being responsible for the drafting of this Agreement for the purpose of applying any rule construing ambiguities against the drafter or otherwise. No draft of this Agreement shall be taken into account in construing this Agreement. Any provision of this Agreement which requires an agreement in writing shall be deemed to require that the writing in question be signed by the Executive and an authorized representative of the Company.
Certain Rules of Construction
22. . This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin, without reference to conflict of law principles thereof. Any dispute arising out of this Agreement shall, at the Executive's election, be determined by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect (in which case both parties shall be bound by the arbitration award) or by litigation. Whether the dispute is to be settled by arbitration or litigation, the venue for the arbitration or litigation shall be Milwaukee, Wisconsin or, at the Executive's election, if the Executive is not then residing or working in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin metropolitan area, in the judicial district encompassing the city in which the Executive resides; , if the Executive is not then residing in the United States, the election of the Executive with respect to such venue shall be either Milwaukee, Wisconsin or in the judicial district encompassing that city in the United States among the thirty cities having the largest population (as determined by the most recent United States Census data available at the Termination Date) which is closest to the Executive's residence. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction in each trial court in the selected venue having subject matter jurisdiction notwithstanding their residence or situs, and each party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided hereunder for the giving of notices.

23. .
Additional Section 409A Provisions
(a) If, after the date of a Change in Control of the Company, any payment amount or the value of any benefit under this Agreement is required to be included in the Executive's income prior to the date such amount is actually paid or the benefit provided as a result of the failure of this Agreement (or any other arrangement that is required to be aggregated with this Agreement under Code Section 409A) to comply with Code Section 409A, then the Executive shall receive a distribution, in a lump sum, within 90 days after the date it is finally determined that the Agreement (or such other arrangement that is required to be aggregated with this Agreement) fails to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; such distribution shall equal the amount required to be included in the Executive's income as a result of such failure and shall reduce the amount of payments or benefits otherwise due hereunder.
(b) The Company and the Executive intend the terms of this Agreement to be in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. The Company does not guarantee the tax treatment or tax consequences associated with any payment or benefit, including but not limited to consequences related to Section 409A of the Code. To the maximum extent permissible, any ambiguous terms of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner that avoids a violation of Section 409A of the Code.
(c) If the Executive believes he is entitled to a payment or benefit pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that was not timely paid or provided, and such payment or benefit is considered deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Executive acknowledges that to avoid an additional tax on such payment or benefit pursuant to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, the Executive must make a reasonable, good faith effort to collect such payment or benefit after the latest date upon which the payment could have been timely made or benefit timely provided without violating Section 409A of the Code, and if not paid or provided, must take further enforcement measures after such latest date.
no later than 90 days
within 180 days

Agreement, subject to the non-duplication and other provisions of said Paragraph 5.1. In addition, in the event of a Covered Termination by the Executive for Good Reason or by the Company for reasons other than death, disability or Cause, such that the Executive is entitled to Accrued Benefits and the Termination Payment under this Agreement, then, the provisions of hereof shall not apply and the Executive shall be entitled to a gross-up payment pursuant to the excise tax gross-up provisions set forth in Paragraph 5.2 of the Employment Agreement.

Exhibit 10.3
This Amended and Restated Employment Agreement made and entered into this 22nd day of December, 2008 (the "Effective Date") by and between Fiserv, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"), and Jeffery W. Yabuki (the "Executive").
WHEREAS, the Executive and the Company entered into an employment agreement on November 7, 2005; and
WHEREAS, the Executive and the Company desire to amend and restate the employment agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code) and to eliminate certain historic provisions that are no longer applicable.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Term of Employment
1.1 The Executive shall commence employment with the Company on December 1, 2005, or such earlier date mutually agreed upon by the Executive and the Company ("Employment Date").
1.2 Commencing on the Employment Date, the Company agrees to employ the Executive, and the Executive agrees to accept such continued employment and serve the Company, in such capacities, with such duties and authority, for such period, at such level of compensation and with such benefits, and upon such other terms and subject to such other conditions, as are hereinafter set forth. The term of Executive's employment shall commence on the Employment Date, and end on December 31, 2009, subject to earlier termination or further renewal as provided in this Agreement (the "Term of Employment").
1.3 . Executive's Term of Employment shall automatically renew for subsequent one (1) year periods, subject to the terms of this Agreement, unless either party gives written notice 90 days or more prior to the expiration of the then existing Term of Employment of Executive's or the Company's decision not to renew. A decision by the Company not to renew other than as a result of Executive's death or Disability (as defined below), and other than in circumstances which would give rise to a termination for Cause (as defined below), shall be treated as a Termination by the Company without Cause and so governed by Paragraph 6.3.5 below. A decision by the Executive not to renew, other than for Good Reason (as defined below), shall be treated as a Voluntary Resignation, and so governed by the provisions of Paragraph 6.3.4 below.
Renewal
 
2. .
Capacities, Duties and Authority
2.1 During the Term of Employment, the Executive shall serve as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). The Executive shall report directly to the Board, and shall direct and manage the affairs of the Company with such duties, functions and responsibilities as contemplated by the Company's by-laws and as the Board shall designate, provided that such duties, functions and responsibilities are commensurate with the Executive's positions of President and Chief Executive Officer.
2.2 The Executive shall serve the Company faithfully, conscientiously and to the best of the Executive's ability and shall promote the interests and reputation of the Company. Unless prevented by sickness or Disability or during a period of vacation or other approved leave of absence, the Executive shall devote substantially all of the Executive's time, attention, knowledge, energy and skills, during normal working hours, and at such other times as the Executive's duties may reasonably require, to the duties of the Executive's employment, provided, however, that it shall not be a breach of this Agreement for the Executive to manage his own private financial investments or to serve on civic or charitable boards, to continue to serve on the corporate boards on which Executive serves as of the Effective Date, or to be a member of the board of directors of other companies which do not compete with the Company, so long as such directorships have been expressly disclosed to, and approved by, the Board, and provided, further, that all such activities do not materially interfere with the Executive's performance of his duties hereunder, cause harm or concern to the Company's operations, profitability or reputation, or otherwise violate this Agreement.
2.3 The Executive represents and warrants that he is not a party to, or otherwise bound by, any agreement, covenant or other restriction that would in any way conflict with or limit his ability to perform his duties hereunder.
3. .
Compensation
3.1 The Executive shall be paid a base salary at the annual rate of $840,000.00, payable semi-monthly and otherwise in accordance with the regular payroll practices of the Company. At least annually, during the Term of Employment, the Company's Compensation Committee shall consider and appraise the contributions of the Executive to the Company, at such time as the contributions of other senior executives of the Company and adjustments to base compensation are considered or made, and due consideration shall be given to the upward adjustment of the Executive's annual base salary, which evaluation and adjustment to base compensation shall be done at such time as the salaries of the other senior executives of the Company are evaluated. During the Term of Employment, Executive's base salary shall not be decreased.

3.3 . The Executive received or shall receive from the Company equity and long-term grants as follows:
Equity and Long-Term Grants
3.3.1 On the Employment Date, the Executive received from the Company: (i) a grant of 145,000 stock options, which will expire ten (10) years after the grant date and will vest over a five (5) year period, twenty percent (20%) on each anniversary of the grant date; (ii) a 45,000 share restricted stock grant with three (3) year cliff vesting and performance-based vesting based on specified earnings per share targets for 2006; (iii) a grant of 7,849 shares of restricted stock with three (3) year cliff vesting and performance-based vesting based on specified earnings per share targets for 2006; and (iv) a grant of 225,000 stock options, which will expire ten (10) years after the date of grant and will vest over a three (3) year period, one third (1/3) on each anniversary of the grant date.

The grants set forth in Paragraph 3.3.1 were awarded to Executive in substantial part to compensate the Executive in lieu of compensation the Executive had to forego due to his resignation from his prior employer.
3.3.3 Commencing in 2006, Executive shall be eligible for and shall receive grants of options and/or restricted stock and/or other equity and long-term awards under the Company's long-term incentive compensation program, which are commensurate with his position and are made at such times and on such terms as grants and awards are made to the Company's senior executive officers generally; provided, that with respect to grants and awards, if any, to be made in 2006, there shall be taken into consideration the 145,000 stock options granted to Executive pursuant to Paragraph 3.3.1.(i) above.
3.4 The Executive shall be entitled to take annual vacation without loss or diminution of compensation, not exceeding four (4) weeks, such vacation to be taken at such time or times, and as a whole or in increments, as the Executive shall elect, consistent with the reasonable needs of the Company's business and such vacation policies as may be established by the Board. The Executive shall further be entitled to the number of paid holidays, and leaves for illness or temporary disability in accordance with the policies of the Company for its senior executives, as the Company may amend or terminate such policies from time to time in its sole discretion.
4. .
Employee Benefit Programs
4.1 During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in and shall have the benefit of all the Company's group medical, dental and vision plans and programs, group life and disability insurance plans, the Company's 401(k) plan, and other employee benefit plans and standard benefits as are or may be generally made available to senior executives of the Company.
 
4.2 Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Section 4 shall be construed to require the Company to establish, maintain or continue any compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement.

5. .
Change in Control of the Company
5.1 Simultaneous with his execution of this Agreement, Executive will execute a Double Trigger Key Executive Employment and Severance Agreement substantially in the form provided to the Executive prior to the date hereof (the "Double Trigger KEESA"). In the event of a "Change in Control of the Company," as defined under the Double Trigger KEESA, during the Term of Employment, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits of the Double Trigger KEESA, provided that if the benefits under the Double Trigger KEESA are duplicative of benefits provided under this Agreement, the Executive shall receive only the most favorable benefits (determined on a benefit-by-benefit basis) under the Double Trigger KEESA and this Agreement; and provided, further, that in the event that after such Change in Control the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment with the Company for Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled to a gross up payment determined as set forth in Paragraph 5.2 below.
5.2 .
Excise Tax Gross-Up
5.2.1 In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the "Contract Payments") or of any other plan, arrangement or agreement of the Company or its subsidiaries ("Other Payments" and, together with the Contract Payments, the "Payments") would be subject to the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") as determined as provided below, the Company shall pay to the Executive, at the time specified in Paragraph 5.2.3, an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of the Excise Tax on Payments and any federal, state, local income and employment tax and the Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, and any interest, penalties or additions to tax payable by the Executive with respect thereto, shall be equal to the total present value (using the applicable federal rate as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code in such calculation) of the Payments at the time such Payments are to be made.
5.2.2 For purposes of determining whether any of the Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amounts of such Excise Tax, (1) the total amount of the Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280(G)(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, except to the extent that, in the opinion of independent counsel selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive ("Independent Counsel"), a Payment (in whole or in part) does not constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, or such "excess parachute payments" (in whole or in part) are not subject to the Excise Tax, (2) the amount of the Payments that shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser of (A) the total
 
amount of the Payments or (B) the amount of "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code (after applying clause (1) hereof), and (3) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by Independent Counsel in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rates of federal income taxation applicable to the individual in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made (which, for this purpose, shall include any additional income tax imposed under Section 409A of the Code with respect to the amount of the Payments or Gross-Up Payment subject to such additional income tax) and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates of taxation applicable to individuals as are in effect in the state and locality of the Executive's residence in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes that can be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes, taking into account any limitations applicable to individuals subject to federal income tax at the highest marginal rates.
5.2.3 The Company shall pay the Executive (or pay on Executive's behalf to the Internal Revenue Service) the Gross-Up Payment provided for in Paragraph 5.2.1, if any, at such time as the Executive is required to remit the Excise Tax to the Internal Revenue Service or such Excise Tax is required to be withheld under applicable law (but based on Executive's actual rate of taxation).
5.2.4 If it is established pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service proceeding or if it is the opinion of Independent Counsel that the Excise Tax is less than the amount taken into account under Paragraph 5.2.2 hereof, the Executive shall repay to the Company within thirty (30) days of the Executive's receipt of notice of such final determination or opinion the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and any federal, state, local income and employment tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax or any federal, state, local income and employment tax deduction) plus any interest received by the Executive on the amount of such repayment. If it is established pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service proceeding or if it is the opinion of Independent Counsel that the Excise Tax exceeds the amount taken into account hereunder (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess within thirty (30) days of the Company's receipt of notice of such final determination or opinion. In the event of any change in, or further interpretation of, Sections 280G or 4999 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the Executive shall be entitled, by written notice to the Company, to request an opinion of Independent Counsel regarding the application of such change to any of the foregoing, and the Company shall use its best efforts to cause such opinion to be rendered as promptly as practicable.

Termination Notice and Procedure
(a) if such termination is for Disability, Cause or Good Reason, the Notice of Termination shall indicate in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances alleged to provide a basis for such termination.

6.3 .

7. .
Acknowledgements; Confidential Information; Competitive Activities; Non Solicitation
7.1 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
7.1.1 The Company is in the business of providing information management solutions to the financial industry-servicing clients in the United States, and throughout the world.
7.1.2 Since the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively and individually referred to in this Section 7 as the "Fiserv Group Companies") would suffer irreparable harm if the Executive left the Company's employ and solicited the business and/or employees of the Fiserv Group Companies, or otherwise interfered with business relationships of the Fiserv Group Companies, it is reasonable to protect the Fiserv Group Companies against such activities by the Executive for a limited period of time after the Executive leaves the Company.
7.1.3 The covenants contained in Paragraphs 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 below are reasonably necessary for the protection of the Fiserv Group Companies and are reasonably limited with respect to the activities they prohibit, their duration, their geographical scope and their effect on the Executive and the public. The purpose and effect of the covenants simply are to protect the Fiserv Group Companies for a limited period of time from unfair competition by the Executive.
7.2 For the purposes of this Agreement, all confidential or proprietary information concerning the business and affairs of the Fiserv Group Companies, including, without limitation, all trade secrets, know how and other information generally retained on a confidential basis by the Fiserv Group Companies concerning their designs, products, methods, know-how, techniques, systems, engineering data, software codes and specifications, formulae, processes, inventions and discoveries, business strategies, sales, marketing and business plans, acquisition prospects and targets, capital expenditure forecasts or plans, investor initiatives, incentive plans, targets or MBOs, business assessments or evaluations, HR assessments or plans, litigation strategies, approaches or theories and settlement plans with regard thereto, organization plans, tax strategies, financial models, public financial disclosure discussions, concerns, approaches or related issues, international market assessments and strategies, pricing, product plans and the identities of, and the nature of the Fiserv Group Companies' dealings with, their suppliers and customers, whether or not such information shall, in whole or in part, be subject to or capable of being protected by patent, copyright or trademark laws, shall constitute "Confidential Information." The Executive acknowledges that he has had and, will from time to time have access to and has obtained and will in the future obtain knowledge of certain Confidential Information, and that improper use or revelation thereof by the Executive, during or after the termination of his employment by the Company, could cause serious injury to the business of the Fiserv Group Companies. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, unless otherwise required by law, he will forever keep secret and inviolate all Confidential Information which shall have come or shall hereafter come into his possession, and that he will not use the same for his own private
 
benefit, or directly or indirectly for the benefit of others, and that he will not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person. If the Executive is legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, he shall provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such legal requirement, so that the Fiserv Group Companies may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Paragraph. In any event, the Executive may furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Executive is advised by legal counsel is required, and he shall exercise his best efforts to obtain an order or assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information as is disclosed. Notwithstanding anything contained herein which may be to the contrary, the term "Confidential Information" does not include any information which at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to and known by the public, other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Executive.
7.3 In addition to the acknowledgments by the Executive set forth in Paragraph 7.1 above, the Executive acknowledges that the services provided by him for the Company are a significant factor in the creation of valuable, special and unique assets which are expected to provide the Fiserv Group Companies with a competitive advantage. Accordingly, the Executive agrees as follows:
7.3.1 Commencing on the Effective Date, and thereafter for a period ending twelve (12) months following Executive's date of termination, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, on his behalf or on behalf of any other individual, association or entity, as agent or otherwise:
(a) contact any of the clients of any of the Fiserv Group Companies for whom Executive directly performed any services or had any direct business contact for the purpose of soliciting business or inducing such client to acquire any product or service that at anytime during the term of this Agreement is provided or under development by the Fiserv Group Companies from any entity other than the Fiserv Group Companies;
(b) contact any of the clients or prospective clients of any of the Fiserv Group Companies whose identity or other client specific information the Executive discovered or gained access to as a result of his access to the Fiserv Group Companies' Confidential Information for the purpose of soliciting or inducing any of such clients or prospective clients to acquire any product or service that at any time during the term of this Agreement is provided or under development by any of the Fiserv Group Companies from any entity other than the Fiserv Group Companies;
(c) use the Fiserv Group Companies' Confidential Information to solicit, influence or encourage any clients or potential clients of any of the Fiserv Group Companies to divert or direct their business to the Executive or any other person, association or entity by or with whom the Executive is employed, associated, engaged as agent or otherwise affiliated; or
 
(d) encourage, induce or entice any employee of any of the Fiserv Group Companies with access to or possession of Confidential Information of the Fiserv Group Companies to leave the employment of the Fiserv Group Companies.
7.3.2 Commencing on the Effective Date, and for a period ending twelve (12) months following Executive's date of termination, without the prior written approval of the Company's Board of Directors, the Executive shall not participate in the management of, be employed by or own any business enterprise at a location within the United States that engages in substantial competition with the Company or any of its subsidiaries in the business described in Paragraph 7.1.1 above, where such enterprise's revenues from any competitive activities amount to 10% or more of such enterprise's net revenues and sales for its most recently completed fiscal year; provided, however, that nothing in this Paragraph shall prohibit the Executive from owning stock or other securities of a competitor amounting to less than five percent of the outstanding capital stock of such competitor.
7.4 The Executive acknowledges and agrees as follows:
7.4.1 The Executive agrees to promptly disclose to the Company any and all discoveries, developments, inventions, products, services, processes, formulas, and improvements thereof ("Inventions"), whether or not patentable, relating to the products, services, commercial or other endeavors of the Fiserv Group Companies, which the Executive may invent, discover, develop or learn in connection with Executive's employment. The Executive agrees that such inventions are the exclusive and absolute property of the Company and that the Company will be the sole and absolute owner of all intellectual property rights, including patent and any and all other rights in connection therewith. The Executive agrees to give all reasonable assistance in the preparation and/or execution of any papers the Company may request to reflect such interest and to secure patent or other protection for such Inventions.
7.4.2 The Executive understands that in the course of employment, the Executive may prepare writings, drawings, diagrams, designs, specifications, manuals, instructions and other materials, and computer code and programs ("Works"). Such Works are "works made for hire" under United States copyright law and the Company shall be the owner of the Executive's entire right of authorship in such Works. If such Works are deemed by operation of law not to be "works made for hire," the Executive hereby assigns to the Company the Executive's entire right of authorship, including copyright ownership in such Works and agrees to execute any document deemed necessary by the Company in connection therewith.
7.5 In the event of a judicial determination that the Executive has breached his obligations under Paragraphs 7.2, 7.3, or 7.4, in addition to any damages or other relief otherwise available to the Fiserv Group Companies, the Executive shall be obligated to reimburse the Company for any payments to the Executive under Paragraph 6.3.5(b)(i) and (iii). In addition, following a judicial determination, the prevailing party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the judicial proceeding seeking to enforce the provisions of Section 7 hereof.
7.6 For the purposes of this Agreement, the period of restriction of confidentiality or proprietary information and competition is intended to limit disclosure and competition by the Executive to the maximum extent permitted by law. If it shall be
 
finally determined by any court of competent jurisdiction ruling on this Agreement that the scope or duration of any limitation contained in this Agreement is too extensive to be legally enforceable, then the parties hereby agree that the provisions hereof shall be construed to be confined to such scope or duration (not greater than that provided for herein) as shall be legally enforceable, and the Executive hereby consents to the enforcement of such limitations as so modified.
7.7 The Executive acknowledges that any violation by him of the provisions of this Section 7 would cause serious and irreparable damage to the Fiserv Group Companies. He further acknowledges that it might not be possible to measure such damage in money. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Executive of the provisions of this Section, the Fiserv Group Companies may seek, in addition to any other rights or remedies, including money damages or specific performance, an injunction or restraining order, without the need to post any bond or other security, prohibiting the Executive from doing or continuing to do any acts constituting such breach or threatened breach.
8. .
Reimbursement of Business Expenses
During the Term of Employment, subject to and in accordance with the Company's policies with regard to such matters applicable to the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive is authorized to incur reasonable business expenses in carrying out his duties and responsibilities under the Agreement, and the Company shall promptly reimburse him for all such properly documented business expenses incurred in accordance with the Company's travel and business expense reimbursement policy applicable to the President and Chief Executive Officer in connection with carrying out the business of the Company.
9. .
Directors and Officers Liability Coverage, Indemnification
Executive shall be entitled to coverage under such directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained from time to time by the Company for the benefit of its directors and officers. The Company shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Wisconsin, from and against all costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), and shall, consistent with the laws of the State of Wisconsin, provide for the reimbursement of expenses, incurred or sustained in connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which the Executive or his legal representatives may be made a party by reason of the Executive's being or having been a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its affiliates or employee benefit plans. Such reimbursement shall be made promptly (but in no event later than the end of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred) following Executive's written request to the Company for reimbursement. The provisions of this Section 9 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Executive seeking indemnification may have under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors, or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.
 
10. .
Miscellaneous
10.1 This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin without reference to principles of conflict of laws. Any legal suit, action or proceeding against any party hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be instituted in a federal or state court in the State of Wisconsin, and each party hereto waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding and each party hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding.
10.2 Upon the Effective Date, this Agreement and the Double Trigger KEESA shall incorporate the complete understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all other prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, between the Executive and the Company or any predecessor thereof, with respect to such subject matter. No provision hereof may be modified or waived except by a written instrument duly executed by the Executive and the Company.
10.3 It is intended that any amounts payable under this Agreement and the Company's and Executive's exercise of authority or discretion hereunder shall comply with Section 409A of the Code (including the Treasury regulations and other published guidance relating thereto) so as not to subject Executive to the payment of any interest or additional tax imposed under Section 409A of the Code. In furtherance of this intent, to the extent that any Treasury regulations, guidance or changes to Section 409A after the date of this Agreement would result in the Executive becoming subject to interest and additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, the Company and Executive agree to amend this Agreement in order to bring this Agreement into compliance with Code Section 409A.
10.4 The Company shall be eligible to deduct and withhold from all compensation payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement all amounts required to be deducted and withheld therefrom pursuant to any present or future law, regulation or ordinance of the United States of America or any state or local jurisdiction therein or any foreign taxing jurisdiction. In addition, if prior to the date of payment of the Termination Payment or other deferred compensation payments or benefits hereunder, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Sections 3101, 3121(a) and 3121(v)(2) of the Code, where applicable, becomes due with respect to any payment or benefit to be provided hereunder, the Company may provide for an immediate payment of the amount needed to pay the Executive's portion of such tax (plus an amount equal to the taxes that will be due on such amount) and the Executive's Termination Payment shall be reduced accordingly.
10.5 Section headings are included in this Agreement for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of the text hereof.
10.6 Notices given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and, except as otherwise provided by Paragraph 6.2 of this Agreement, shall be deemed given when actually received by the Executive or actually received by the Company's Secretary or any officer of the Company other than the Executive.

5. During the Employment Term, Employee shall devote his full business time, best efforts and business judgment, faithfully, conscientiously and to the best of his ability to the advancement of the interests of the Company and to the discharge of the responsibilities and offices held by him. Employee shall not engage in any other business activity, whether or not pursued for
pecuniary advantage, except as may be approved in advance by the Company, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit or limit Employee from participating in civic, charitable or other not-for-profit activities or to manage personal passive investments, provided that such activities do not materially interfere with Employee's services required under this Agreement and do not violate the Code of Conduct or other corporate policies of Fiserv. Employee hereby acknowledges that he has read Fiserv's Code of Conduct in effect as of the date hereof, attached hereto as Exhibit A, and agrees that he will comply with such Code of Conduct and other Fiserv corporate policies regarding activities in the workplace, as they may be amended from time to time, in all material respects.
6. For all services to be rendered by Employee in any capacity during the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Employee and shall provide or cause to be provided to him the following:
(a) An annual base salary at a minimum rate of $350,000 per year, commencing on his first day of employment, which is expected to be January 2, 2007, payable in accordance with the normal payroll practices and schedule of the Company. Beginning in February 2008 and thereafter, the Employee's direct supervisor ("Direct Supervisor") will determine Employee's annual base salary, it being understood by Employee that adjustments to annual base salary will be for unusual events and will not typically be made each year. To that end, Employee's Direct Supervisor will review annually the performance of Employee. The term "annual base salary" shall not include any payment or other benefit that is denominated as or is in the nature of a bonus, incentive payment, commission, profit-sharing payment, retirement or pension accrual, insurance benefit, other fringe benefit or expense allowance, whether or not taxable to Employee as income.
(b) In addition to the salary provided above, as of the date of commencement of employment and thereafter, Employee shall be entitled to participate in the Management Bonus Plan or other incentive compensation program, as offered by the Company from time to time for senior executives of the Company. For the calendar year 2007, Employee will have a target bonus of 100% of annual base salary ($350,000) with an opportunity to achieve a maximum bonus of 200% of annual base salary ($700,000), to be paid no later than March 15, 2008, according to the Company's usual practice, except that in 2007 only Employee shall receive a draw ("Draw") against such target bonus in the amount of $12,500 per month, payable on the date of the last salary check of each month. If the Company terminates Employee for cause, as defined in Section 7(c), or Employee voluntarily ceases his employment with the Company on or before the date of payment of any incentive compensation hereunder in March 2008, Employee shall not be entitled to any portion of any payment under the Management Bonus Plan or other incentive compensation program and shall be obligated to pay back all Draws paid by the Company in 2007. For clarity, if Employee does not achieve a bonus in excess of the aggregate amount of Draws paid by the Company in 2007 in respect of such bonus, Employee shall not be obligated to refund any amounts paid in connection with such Draws, except in the circumstances set forth in the previous sentence where the Employee is not employed by the Company on the date of payment of any incentive compensation hereunder in March 2008.
 
(c) The Company shall pay to Employee a one-time bonus in the amount of $450,000. Such bonus will be payable not later than March 31, 2007, but shall be repaid in full by Employee if Employee shall be terminated for cause, as defined in Section 7(c), or shall voluntarily terminate his employment with the Company, in either case prior to March 31, 2008.
(d) The Employee shall receive equity in the Company (each a "") as follows:

For the calendar year 2007, Employee will have a target range of one to two times annual base salary, to be issued or granted no later than March 15, 2008, according to the Company's usual practice. If Employee shall not be employed by the Company on the date of grant of any options or restricted stock hereunder, Employee shall not be entitled to any portion of any such options or restricted stock award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, all awards of options or restricted stock are subject to the approval of the Company's Board of Directors or its designated committee.

Such confidential information is understood to include, without limitation, products, technology, intellectual property, customer lists, prospect lists and price lists, or any part of such items, and any information relating to Company's method and technique used in servicing its customers.
9.
(a) For purposes of this Section 9, the following definitions apply:
(i) "" means any person, association or entity: (1) for which Employee has directly performed services, (2) for which Employee has supervised others in performing services, or (3) about which Employee has special knowledge as a result of his employment with the Company, during all or any part of the 24-month period ending on the date of the termination of his employment with the Company.
Customer
(ii) "" means any product or service which is sold in competition with, or is being developed and which will compete with, a product or service developed, manufactured, or sold by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, "Competing Products or Services" are limited to products and/or services for which Employee participated in the development, planning, testing, sale, marketing or evaluation of on behalf of the Company in or during any part of the last 24 months of his employment with the Company, or for which Employee supervised one or more Company employees, units, divisions or departments in doing so.
Competing Product or Service
 
(iii) "" means material, non-public information about a person, association or entity that Employee learned as a result of his employment with the Company and/or the Company's client development or marketing efforts during all or any part of the last 24 months of his employment with the Company.
Special Knowledge
(b) Employee agrees that the Company's customer contacts and relations are established and maintained at great expense. Employee further agrees that, as an employee of the Company, he or she will have unique and extensive exposure to and contact with the Company's customers and employees, and that he or she will have had the opportunity to establish unique relationships that would enable him to compete unfairly against the Company. Moreover, Employee acknowledges that he or she will have had unique and extensive knowledge of the Company's trade secret and confidential information, and that such information, if used by him or others, would allow him or others to compete unfairly against the Company. Therefore, in consideration of the compensation and benefits paid to him pursuant to this Agreement, Employee agrees that, for a period of 12 months after the date of the termination of his employment, Employee will not, either on his own behalf of on behalf of any other person, association or entity:
(i) Contact any Customer for the purpose of soliciting or inducing such client to purchase a Competing Product or Service;
(ii) Solicit an employee of the Company to terminate his employment with the Company;
(iii) Become financially interested in, be employed by or have any connection with, directly or indirectly, either individually or as owner, partner, agent, employee, consultant, creditor or otherwise, except for the account of or on behalf of the Company, or its affiliates, in any business or activity listed on Exhibit C, or any affiliate, successor or assign of such business or activity or any other business enterprise that engages in substantial competition with the Company or any of its subsidiaries in the business of providing management solutions to the financial industry; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Employee from owning publicly traded stock or other securities of a competitor amounting to less than one percent of such outstanding class of securities of such competitor; or
(iv) Become an owner, partner, director or officer of a company that develops, sells or markets a Competing Product or Service.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Section 9:
(i) Shall not bar Employee from all employment. Employee warrants and agrees that there are ample employment opportunities that he or she could fill following his employment with the Company, in his field of experience, without violating this Agreement;
(ii) Shall not bar Employee from performing clerical, menial or manual labor;
 
(iii) Subject to Section 9(b)(iii), including the proviso thereof, shall not prohibit Employee from investing as a passive investor in the capital stock or other securities of a publicly traded corporation listed on a national security exchange.
10. Employee acknowledges and agrees that compliance with this Agreement is necessary to protect the Company, and that a breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Company for which there will be no adequate remedy at law. Employee hereby agrees that in the event of any such breach of this Agreement, the Company, and its successors and assigns, shall be entitled to injunctive relief and to such other and further relief as is proper under the circumstances. Employee further agrees that, in the event of his breach of this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to recover the value of any amounts previously paid or payable to Employee pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof and of any Stock Program. Employee understands and agrees that the losses incurred by the Company as a result of such breach of this Agreement would be difficult or impossible to calculate, as they are based on, among other things, the value of the knowledge and information gained by the Employee at the expense of the Company, but that the actual value exceeds the amounts paid or payable to Employee pursuant to Section 6(b) and any Stock Program. Accordingly, the amount paid or payable to Employee pursuant to Section 6(b) and any Stock Program herein represents the Employee's agreement to pay and the Company's agreement to accept as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, such amount for any such Employee breach. Employee and the Company hereby agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of any Court of competent jurisdiction in any disputes that arise under this Agreement.
(a) The Company shall be eligible to deduct and withhold from all compensation payable to the Employee pursuant to this Agreement all amounts required to be deducted and withheld therefrom pursuant to any present or future law, regulation or ordinance of the United States of America or any state or local jurisdiction therein or any foreign taxing jurisdiction. In addition, if prior to the date of payment of the amount due under Section 7(f)(i) or other deferred compensation payments or benefits hereunder, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax imposed under Sections 3101, 3121(a) and 3121(v)(2) of the Code, where applicable, becomes due with respect to any payment or benefit to be provided hereunder, the Company may provide for an immediate payment of the amount needed to pay the Employee's portion of such tax (plus an amount equal to the taxes that will be due on such amount) and the Employee's payment or benefits shall be reduced accordingly.
11. Employee agrees that the terms of this Agreement shall survive the termination of his employment with the Company.
12. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws in the State of New York.
13. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.
 
14. THE EMPLOYEE HAS READ THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREES THAT THE CONSIDERATION PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY IS FAIR AND REASONABLE AND FURTHER AGREES THAT GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY OF ITS CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, THE POST-EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS ON THE EMPLOYEE'S ACTIVITIES ARE LIKEWISE FAIR AND REASONABLE.
15. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared illegal or unenforceable by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each remaining provision of this Agreement shall be valid and be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
16. No term or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived, nor shall thereby create any estoppel against the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement, except by written instrument of the party charged with such waiver or estoppel. No such written waiver shall be deemed a continuing waiver unless specifically stated therein, and each such waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition for the future or as to any act other than that specifically waived.
17. No term or provision or the duration of this Agreement shall be altered, varied or contradicted except by a writing to that effect, executed by authorized officers of the Company and Fiserv and by Employee, and in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have hereunto set their hands.
