Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For Immediate Release
 
 
 Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), the leading global provider of financial services technology solutions, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2009. These financial results reflect the disposition of a 51% interest in Fiserv's insurance operations ("Fiserv Insurance") in July of 2008.
Brookfield, Wis., April 30, 2009
Total GAAP revenue was $1.04 billion for the first quarter of 2009 compared with $1.31 billion in 2008. Total adjusted revenue decreased 3 percent to $989 million for the first quarter of 2009 compared with $1.02 billion in 2008 due primarily to declines in the home equity processing business.
GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2009 were $0.65 compared with $0.60 for the first quarter of 2008. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter including discontinued operations were $0.66 compared with $1.99 for the first quarter of 2008, which included $1.39 from discontinued operations due primarily to gains on disposition.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 10 percent to $0.88 for the quarter compared with $0.80 in 2008. Adjusted internal revenue declined by 4 percent in the first quarter.
Adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2008 to 27.9 percent. The increase in operating margin was primarily from growth in higher-margin revenue, favorable changes in the company's business mix and operating efficiency.
"Our results showcase the strength of our business model as we continue to deliver highly valued products and services across the financial services market," said Jeffery Yabuki, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fiserv. "In spite of the expected revenue weakness in the quarter, we managed the business to optimize margins and grew adjusted earnings per share ten percent. In addition, we took proactive steps to increase our investments in several key areas that should enhance market differentiation and boost growth. We are pleased with our start to the year."

Outlook for 2009
Fiserv continues to expect full-year 2009 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to be within a range of $3.61 to $3.75, which represents growth of 10 to 14 percent compared with $3.29 in 2008. The company expects 2009 adjusted internal revenue growth to be in a range of 0 to 4 percent. The adjusted earnings per share outlook excludes the impact of extraordinary gains or charges, merger and integration costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
"We are on track to achieve our full-year targets in a watershed year for the financial services industry ," said Yabuki.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We supplement our reporting of total revenues, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share information determined in accordance with GAAP by using "adjusted revenues," "adjusted operating income," "adjusted income from continuing operations," "adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations," "adjusted operating margin," "free cash flow," and "adjusted internal revenue growth" in this earnings release. Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or unusual revenue or expense items, and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenues and expenses, enhance our shareholders' ability to evaluate our performance because such items do not reflect how we manage our operations. Therefore, we exclude these items from GAAP revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share to calculate these non-GAAP
 
 
measures. We also exclude the financial results of Fiserv Insurance from "adjusted revenues," "adjusted operating income" and "adjusted operating margin" because we sold a majority interest in our Insurance segment in 2008 and, accordingly, believe that these results reflect the performance of our remaining primary operations.
Examples of non-cash or unusual items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, severance costs and merger and integration expenses. We exclude these items to more clearly focus on the factors we believe are pertinent to the management of our operations. We regularly report our adjusted results to our chief executive officer, who uses this information to allocate resources to our various businesses.
Free cash flow and adjusted internal revenue growth are described in detail on pages 9 and 11. Adjusted internal revenue growth percentage is a non-GAAP financial measure that the company believes is useful to investors because it presents internal revenue growth excluding postage reimbursements in the company's output solutions business and the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment. We believe this supplemental information enhances our shareholders' ability to evaluate and understand our core business performance.
These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenues, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Free cash flow has been adjusted for payments totaling $10 million and $5 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to after-tax merger and severance costs. Management believes it is appropriate to exclude these payments from the calculation of free cash flow because they may not be indicative of the future free cash flow of the company.
