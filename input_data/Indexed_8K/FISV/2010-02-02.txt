 Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), the leading global provider of financial services technology solutions, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009.
Brookfield, Wis., February 2, 2010
Total GAAP revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.06 billion compared with $1.04 billion in 2008. Total adjusted revenue increased 2 percent to $1.01 billion in the quarter compared with $984 million in 2008. Total GAAP revenue for the year was $4.08 billion compared with $4.59 billion in 2008. Total adjusted revenue for the year decreased 1 percent to $3.87 billion compared with $3.89 billion in 2008.
GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $0.83 compared with $0.50 in 2008. Total GAAP earnings per share, including discontinued operations, were $0.76 for the fourth quarter compared with $0.39 in 2008. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.04 for the year compared with $2.20 in 2008. Total GAAP earnings per share, including discontinued operations, were $3.06 for the year compared with $3.49 in 2008.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter increased 6 percent to $0.94 compared with $0.89 in 2008.

Outlook for 2010
Fiserv expects 2010 adjusted internal revenue growth to be in a range of 1 to 3 percent. The company expects its 2010 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $3.96 to $4.07, which represents growth of 8 to 11 percent compared with the $3.66 earned in 2009. The adjusted earnings per share outlook excludes the impact of extraordinary gains or charges, merger and integration costs, and the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
"The strong finish to 2009 is another proof point that our strategy is working. Although we believe the environment in 2010 will remain tough, we expect to grow revenue, earnings and free cash flow while continuing to invest in solutions that will help our clients to be even more successful," said Yabuki.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We supplement our reporting of total revenues, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share information determined in accordance with GAAP by using "adjusted revenues," "adjusted operating income," "adjusted income from continuing operations," "adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations," "adjusted operating margin," "free cash flow" and "adjusted internal revenue growth" in this earnings release. Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or unusual revenue or expense items, and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenues and expenses, enhance our shareholders' ability to evaluate our performance because such items do not reflect how we manage our operations. Therefore, we exclude these items from GAAP revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share to calculate these non-GAAP measures. We also exclude the financial results of Fiserv Insurance from "adjusted revenues," "adjusted operating income" and "adjusted operating margin" because we sold a majority interest in our Insurance segment in 2008 and, accordingly, believe that these adjusted results reflect the performance of our remaining primary operations.
Examples of non-cash or unusual items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, severance costs, merger and integration expenses and non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions. We exclude these items to more clearly focus on the factors we believe are pertinent to the management of our operations. We regularly report our adjusted results to our chief executive officer, who uses this information to allocate resources to our various businesses.
Free cash flow and adjusted internal revenue growth are described in detail on pages 10 and 12. Adjusted internal revenue growth percentage is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors because it presents internal revenue growth excluding postage reimbursements in our output solutions business and deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. We believe this supplemental information enhances our shareholders' ability to evaluate and understand our core business performance.
 
 
These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenues, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures reflect management's judgment of particular items and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

The factors that may affect the company's results include, among others: the impact on the company's business of the current state of the economy, including the risk of reduction in revenue resulting from decreased spending on the products and services that the company offers or from the elimination of existing or potential clients due to consolidation or financial failures in the financial services industry; changes in client demand for the company's products or services; pricing or other actions by competitors; the impact of the company's Fiserv 2.0 initiatives; the company's ability to comply with government regulations, including privacy regulations; and other factors included in the company's filings with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Free cash flow has been adjusted for payments totaling $16 million and $35 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to after-tax merger and severance costs and for the net change in settlement assets and obligations in 2009. Management believes it is appropriate to exclude these items from the calculation of free cash flow because they may not be indicative of the future free cash flow of the company. See pages 4 and 5 for disclosures related to the use of non-GAAP financial information.
