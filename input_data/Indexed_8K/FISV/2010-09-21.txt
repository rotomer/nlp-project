On September 21, 2010, Fiserv, Inc. (the "Company") completed the sale of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes") and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes," and together with the 2015 Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes are guaranteed by certain of the Company's wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") and were issued under an Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of November 20, 2007, among the Company, the guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a Fifth Supplemental Indenture, among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, establishing the terms and providing for the issuance of the 2015 Notes (the "2015 Notes Supplemental Indenture"), and by a Sixth Supplemental Indenture, among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, establishing the terms and providing for the issuance of the 2020 Notes (the "2020 Notes Supplemental Indenture").
The 2015 Notes Supplemental Indenture and form of the 2015 Note, which is included therein, provide, among other things, that the 2015 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.125% per year (payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2011), and will mature on October 1, 2015. The 2020 Notes Supplemental Indenture and form of the 2020 Note, which is included therein, provide, among other things, that the 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.625% per year (payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2011), and will mature on October 1, 2020. The interest rate payable on each of the 2015 Notes and the 2020 Notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if a debt rating agency downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to such series of notes.
The Company may redeem the Notes at any time prior to maturity at a "make-whole" redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company is required to offer to repurchase the Notes for cash at a price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event.
All payments with respect to the Notes, including principal and interest, will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantors. The Company expects that the Notes will also be guaranteed in the future by certain subsidiaries under certain circumstances. If a Guarantor is released from its guarantees with respect to the Company's Credit Agreement, as amended November 9, 2007, among the Company and the financial institutions parties thereto, the Loan Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2007, among the Company and the financial institutions parties thereto and any other debt of the Company of an amount in excess of 10% of the Company's net worth, then such Guarantor will be released from its guarantee of the Notes upon notice by the Company to the Trustee.
The Indenture, the 2015 Notes Supplemental Indenture and the 2020 Notes Supplemental Indenture contain customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of the Notes, then the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding Notes of that series may declare the Notes of that series to be due and payable immediately. In addition, in the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately.
The descriptions of the 2015 Notes Supplemental Indenture and the 2020 Notes Supplemental Indenture set forth above are qualified by reference to the 2015 Notes Supplemental Indenture and the 2020 Notes Supplemental Indenture filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.

(1) On September 21, 2010, the Company shall issue and deliver to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall authenticate, the Initial Notes substantially in the form set forth in Section 3.2 below, in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture, and with such letters, numbers, or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or Depositary therefor or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers executing such Notes, as evidenced by their execution of such Notes.

The aggregate principal amount of Initial Notes Outstanding at any time may not exceed $300,000,000, except for Notes issued, authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes of the Series pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture and except for any Notes which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered. The Company may without the consent of the Holders, issue Additional Notes hereunder on the same terms and conditions (and having the same guarantors) and with the same CUSIP numbers as the Initial Notes, provided that if any Additional Notes are issued at a price that causes such Additional Notes to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations of the United States Department of Treasury thereunder (the "Code"), such Additional Notes shall not have the same CUSIP number as the Initial Notes.
(3) The Notes shall be issued only in fully registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
(1) Interest on the Notes will accrue at the per annum rate of 3.125%, subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.2(7) (the per annum rate at which the Notes shall bear interest at any time, the "Note Interest Rate"), and will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
(2) The Company shall pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year (each, an ","), commencing April 1, 2011.
Interest Payment Date
(3) Interest shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders of the Notes on the Regular Record Date.
(4) Amounts due on the Maturity Date or earlier Redemption Date or Change of Control Payment Date for the Notes will be payable, at the corporate trust office of the Trustee at 60 Livingston Avenue, Mail Code EP-MN W2ZW, St. Paul, Minnesota 55107-2292 or the office maintained from time to time by the Trustee in The City of New York. The Company may make payment of interest on an Interest Payment Date in respect of Notes in certificated form by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled to the payment as it appears in the Security Register or by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located in the United States. The Company shall make payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of Notes in book-entry form to DTC (as defined below) in immediately available funds, while disbursement of such payments to owners of beneficial interests in Notes in book-entry form will be made in accordance with the procedures of DTC and its participants in effect from time to time.
 
(5) Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall impose any service charge for any transfer or exchange of a Note. However, the Company may ask Holders of the Notes to pay any taxes or other governmental charges in connection with a transfer or exchange of Notes.
(6) If any Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Change of Control Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Company will make the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest on the next such Business Day as if it were made on the date payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after that Interest Payment Date, the Maturity Date or earlier Redemption Date or Change of Control Payment Date, as the case may be, to the next such Business Day.
(7) The Note Interest Rate will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody's (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) or S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes, as set forth in this Section 1.2(7).
(i) If the ratings from Moody's or S&P (or, in either case if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to the Notes (each, a "", and collectively, the "") is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table with respect to that Rating Agency, the Note Interest Rate will increase from 3.125% by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
Rating Agency
Rating Agencies
 
 
(ii) If at any time the Note Interest Rate has been adjusted upward as a result of a decrease in a rating by a Rating Agency and that Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating with respect to the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the Note Interest Rate will be decreased such that the interest rate per annum equals 3.125% plus the percentage set forth opposite the rating in effect immediately following the increase in the table above; that if Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "Baa3" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "BBB-" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the Note Interest Rate will be decreased to 3.125%.
provided
 
(iii) No adjustment in the Note Interest Rate shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the Notes, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Notes from another nationally recognized statistical rating organization, to the extent one exists, and if another nationally recognized statistical rating organization rates the Notes (such organization, as certified by a Board Resolution, a ""), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the Note Interest Rate pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating for the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's and S&P in such table and (c) the Note Interest Rate will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate per annum equals 3.125% plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above). For so long as (i) only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, any increase or decrease in the Note Interest Rate necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by that Rating Agency shall be twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above and (ii) no Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the Note Interest Rate will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 5.125%.
Substitute Rating Agency
(iv) Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency, shall be made independent of (and in addition to) any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the Note Interest Rate be reduced below 3.125% or (2) the Note Interest Rate exceed 5.125%.
(v) Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
(vi) The Note Interest Rate will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any Rating Agency) if the Notes become rated "A3" (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency) and "A-" (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if only rated by one Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.

1. . This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its "3.125% Senior Notes due 2015" (herein called the ""), issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 20, 2007, as supplemented by that certain Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 21, 2010 (the "" and herein with the Indenture, collectively, the ""), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The aggregate principal amount of Initial Notes Outstanding at any time may not exceed $300,000,000 in aggregate principal amount, except for, or in lieu of, other Notes of the Series pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture and except for any Notes which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered. Additional Notes of the same series of Securities as the Notes may be issued in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.1(2) of the Supplemental Indenture.

All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. In the event of a conflict between this Note and the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern.
2. . The Note Interest Rate will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody's (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) or S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes, as set forth below.
Interest Rate Adjustment
If the ratings from Moody's or S&P (or, in either case if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to the Notes (each, a "", and collectively, the "") is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table with respect to that Rating Agency, the Note Interest Rate will increase from 3.125% by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
Rating Agency
Rating Agencies
 
 
 
If at any time the Note Interest Rate has been adjusted upward as a result of a decrease in a rating by a Rating Agency and that Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating with respect to the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the Note Interest Rate will be decreased such that the interest rate per annum equals 3.125% plus the percentage set forth opposite the rating in effect immediately following the increase in the table above; provided that if Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "Baa3" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "BBB-" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the Note Interest Rate will be decreased to 3.125%.
No adjustment in the Note Interest Rate shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the Notes, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Notes from another nationally recognized statistical rating organization, to the extent one exists, and if another nationally recognized statistical rating organization rates the Notes (such organization, as certified by a Board Resolution, a ""), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the Note Interest Rate pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating for the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's and S&P in such table and (c) the Note Interest Rate will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate per annum equals 3.125% plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above). For so long as (i) only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, any increase or decrease in the Note Interest Rate necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by that Rating Agency shall be twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above and (ii) no Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the Note Interest Rate will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 5.125%.
Substitute Rating Agency
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency, shall be made independent of (and in addition to) any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the Note Interest Rate be reduced below 3.125% or (2) the Note Interest Rate exceed 5.125%.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
The Note Interest Rate will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any Rating Agency) if the Notes become rated "A3" (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency) and "A-" (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if only rated by one Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.
 
3. . At any time prior to the Maturity Date, the Company may at its option redeem all or a part of the Notes upon not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior notice, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of any Notes being redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of unpaid interest accrued thereon to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year of twelve 30 day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, unpaid interest on the Notes to be redeemed, accrued to the Redemption Date.
Optional Redemption

5. .

Change of Control Triggering Event
6. . If this Note is a Global Security, then, in the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Note, including an exchange, transfer, redemption, repurchase or conversion of this Note in part only, the Trustee, as custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the Applicable Procedures.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note. Certain modifications or amendments to the Indenture require the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected.
Amendment, Supplement and Waiver
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair (without the consent of the Holder hereof) the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

Failure to give notice by mailing in the manner herein provided to the Holder of any Notes designated for redemption as a whole or in part, or any defect in the notice to any such Holder, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Notes or portion thereof.
 
All notices of redemption shall state:
(i) the Redemption Date;
(ii) the Redemption Price;
(iii) the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed;
(iv) if less than all of the Outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the portions of the principal amounts) of the particular Notes to be redeemed;
(v) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Note to be redeemed and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date;
(vi) the place or places where such Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price;
(vii) the CUSIP numbers of such Notes, if any (or any other numbers used by the Depositary to identify such Notes); and
(viii) that, unless the Company defaults in paying the Redemption Price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes called for redemption on the Redemption Date.
Notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed shall be given by the Company or, on Company Request, by the Trustee at the expense of the Company.
(4) On or before any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003 of the Indenture) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all the Notes which are to be redeemed on that date.
(5) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Notes so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price) such Notes shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Note for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Note shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price; provided, however, that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Notes registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms.
If any Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal thereof shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate borne by the Note.
 
(6) Any Note which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at an office or agency in accordance with the notice of redemption (with, if the Company or the Trustee shall so require, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or other appropriate person), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Note, without service charge, a new Note or Notes of any authorized denominations as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Note so surrendered.

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to engage in sale and leaseback transactions except for Permitted Sale-Leaseback Transactions.
 
(1) Upon the occurrence of any Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder of Notes shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") on the terms set forth herein at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of purchase (the "").

provided
(4) The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all the Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer or (ii) prior to the occurrence of the related Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company has given written notice of a redemption as provided under Section 5.1 unless the Company has failed to pay the Redemption Price on the Redemption Date.
 
If, after the date of the Supplemental Indenture, any Subsidiary of the Company that is not then a Guarantor guarantees, becomes a borrower or guarantor under, or grants any Lien to secure any obligations pursuant to, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility, any refinancing or replacement thereof or any other indebtedness for borrowed money (including capital leases) having an aggregate principal amount outstanding in excess of 10% of the Company's Net Worth as of the end of the Company's most recent quarter for which financial statements are available (such Net Worth to be measured at the time of the incurrence of each such guarantee or borrowing or the granting of such Lien), then in any such case such Subsidiary will become a Guarantor by executing a supplemental indenture and delivering it to the Trustee within twenty Business Days of the date on which it guaranteed or incurred such Indebtedness or granted such Lien, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the preceding, any Guarantee by a Guarantor that was issued pursuant to this paragraph solely as a result of its guarantee or incurrence of, or granting of a Lien in respect of, any such indebtedness shall be automatically and unconditionally released upon the release or discharge of the guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Subsidiary's Guarantee (or upon such Subsidiary ceasing to be a borrower or the release of Liens granted by such Subsidiary, as the case may be), except a discharge or release as a result of payment under such guarantee, or of the refinancing or replacement of any such indebtedness that is guaranteed or incurred by such Guarantor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no SPE shall guarantee the Notes and no Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to guarantee the Notes unless it becomes a guarantor under, or grants any Lien to secure any obligations pursuant to such Revolving Credit Facility or Term Loan Facility, or any refinancing or replacement thereof.
 
Section 901 of the Indenture shall, with respect to the Notes, be replaced in its entirety with the following:
"Without the consent of any Holders of the Notes, the Company and the Guarantors, when authorized by a Board Resolution, together with the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may modify and amend the Indenture, this Supplemental Indenture and the terms of the Notes to:

(2) add to the covenants of the Company or the Guarantors for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or the Guarantors under this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes;
(3) add any additional Events of Default;
(4) secure the Notes;
(5) provide for a successor Trustee with respect to the Notes and add or change any of the provisions of the Indenture or the Supplemental Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts thereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 611 of the Indenture;
(6) add or release a Guarantor as required or permitted by this Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture;
 
(7) cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; or
(8) make any other amendment or supplement to this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes, as long as that amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of any Notes in any material respect (to be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel).
No amendment to this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes made solely to conform this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes to the Description of the Notes and Description of Debt Securities contained in the Company's prospectus supplement and prospectus, each dated September 14, 2010 and relating to the Notes, shall be deemed to adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the Notes."
 
The first paragraph, including clauses (1) through (5) thereof, of Section 902 of the Indenture shall, with respect to the Notes, be replaced with the following:
"With the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, the Guarantors and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for purpose adding any provisions to or changing an any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture or the Notes or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby:
(1) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, any Note;
(3) reduce the principal of, or rate of interest on, any Note;
(4) reduce any amount payable upon the redemption or purchase at the option of the Holder of any Note;

(7) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Guarantee, the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture; or
 
(8) reduce the percentage in principal amount of Outstanding Notes the consent of whose Holders is required for modification or amendment of the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for waiver of compliance with provisions of the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or waiver of defaults, in each case, with respect to or in respect of provisions hereof and thereof that cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby."
The second paragraph of Section 902 of the Indenture shall, with respect to the Notes, add the following as the last sentence thereto:
"In addition, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes waive compliance with the Company's covenants described under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this Supplemental Indenture."
 
Section 801 of the Indenture shall, with respect to the Notes be replaced with the following:
"The Company shall not in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, consolidate or merge with or into any other Person, permit any other Person to consolidate with or merge into the Company or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person, unless:
(1) the Company is the surviving entity or, the Person formed by such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or the Person to which all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company are conveyed, transferred or leased, as the case may be, shall be an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and shall expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on the Outstanding Notes and the performance and observance of every covenant of this Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or observed;
(2) immediately after giving effect to any such transaction and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as a result of such transaction as having been incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company at the time of such transaction, there shall not be any Event of Default or event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default;
(3) if, as a result of any such transaction, the properties or assets of the Company would become subject to a Lien which would not be permitted under Section 6.1 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company or such successor Person, as the case may be, shall take those steps that are necessary to secure all the Outstanding Notes equally and ratably with Indebtedness secured by that Lien; and
 
(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the consummation of the particular consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease under this Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture have been complied with."
 
Section 802 shall, with respect to the Notes, be replaced with the following:
"Upon any consolidation or merger by the Company with or into any other Person or any conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company to any other Person in accordance with Section 8.1, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or merger or to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person has been named as the Company herein, and thereafter, except in the case of a lease to another Person, the predecessor Person shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under the Indenture, this Supplemental Indenture and the Notes (to the extent the Company was the predecessor Person)."
Article 15 of the Indenture shall not be applicable to the Notes.
 
(1) For value received, each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally, fully, unconditionally and absolutely guarantees (each a "Guarantee") to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes or the obligations of the Company or any other Guarantor to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder, that (a) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be duly and punctually paid in full when due, whether at maturity, upon redemption, by acceleration or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest, if any, on the Notes and all other obligations of the Company or the Guarantor to the Holders of or the Trustee under this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes hereunder (including fees, expenses or others) (collectively, the "Obligations") will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture and the Notes; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. If the Company shall fail to pay when due, or to perform, any Obligations, for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be obligated to pay, or to perform or cause the performance of, the same promptly. An Event of Default under this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes shall entitle the Holders of the Notes to accelerate the Obligations of the Guarantor hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the Obligations of the Company.
 
(2) Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes, this Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions of this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes, any release of any other Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same, whether or not a Guarantee is affixed to any particular Note, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor.
(3) Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of the Notes and the Trustee, on the other hand, (a) the maturity of the Obligations may be accelerated as provided in Section 502 of the Indenture and Article IV of this Supplemental Indenture for the purposes of the Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations, and (b) in the event of any acceleration of such Obligations as provided in Section 502 of the Indenture and Article IV of this Supplemental Indenture, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for the purposes of its Guarantee.
 
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its Guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.
 
Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes to the security, if any, held for payment of the Obligations.
 
Subject to Section 9.10 of this Supplemental Indenture, the obligations of each of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes, any other guarantee or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations).
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Company or any other Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Company, other than final payment in full in cash of the Obligations. Each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of each of the Guarantors against the Company or any security.
 
Subject to Section 9.10 of this Supplemental Indenture, each of the Guarantors further agrees that its Guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company.
 
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right of each of the Guarantors by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each of the Guarantors hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Holders in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligations, and thereupon the Holders shall, assign (except to the extent that such assignment would render a Guarantor a "creditor" of the Company within the meaning of Section 547 of Title 11 of the United States Code as now in effect or hereafter amended or any comparable provision of any successor statute) the amount of the Obligations owed to it and paid by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guarantee to such Guarantor, such assignment to be to the extent the Obligations in question were discharged by such Guarantor, or make such other disposition thereof as such Guarantor shall direct (all without recourse to the Holders, and without any representation or warranty by the Holders). If (a) a Guarantor shall make payment to the Holders of all or any part of the Obligations and (b) all the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Supplemental Indenture shall be paid in full, the Trustee will, at such Guarantor's request, execute and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the Obligations resulting from such payment by such Guarantor.
pro rata
 
Each of the Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Company's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each of the Guarantors assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes will have no duty to advise the Guarantors of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Holders, as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against the Company, arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise, shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations to the Trustee; , , that any right of subrogation that such Guarantor may have pursuant to this Supplemental Indenture is subject to Section 9.7 hereof.
provided
however
 
(1) A Guarantor shall, upon the occurrence of any of the following events, be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all obligations under this Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee without any action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, that such Guarantor would not, immediately after such release and discharge, be required to become a Guarantor pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof if such Guarantor had incurred its then-existing guarantees, indebtedness for borrowed money (including capital leases) and Liens at the time of such release and discharge:
provided
(i) upon notice by the Company to the Trustee, at any time such Guarantor is not a borrower or guarantor under, and has not granted any then-existing Lien to secure any obligations pursuant to, the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility, any refinancing or replacement thereof (including as a result of any release from such obligations in connection with (x) a Guarantor ceasing to be a "material subsidiary" as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility, any refinancing or replacement thereof or (y) any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock or assets of a Guarantor), and all other indebtedness for borrowed money (including capital leases) having an aggregate principal amount outstanding in excess of 10% of the Company's Net Worth and is released or discharged from each guarantee and Lien granted by such Guarantor with respect to all such indebtedness (other than obligations arising under the Indenture and any Securities issued thereunder) except where resulting from a discharge or release as a result of payment under such guarantee; or
(ii) upon the occurrence of the circumstances described in the penultimate sentence of Section 6.4 hereof, of which the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee.
(2) A Guarantor shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all obligations under this Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee without any action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder upon any Covenant Defeasance or Defeasance with respect to the Notes, subject to reinstatement pursuant to Section 1306 of the Indenture.
(3) The Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release upon receipt of a request of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate certifying as to the compliance with this Section. Any Guarantor not so released will remain liable for the full amount of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes provided in this Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee.
 
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance hereof each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee by such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Title 11 of the United States Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Holders and such Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount which, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor, and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of, any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under this Supplemental Indenture, will result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting such fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor in a amount based on the net assets of each Guarantor, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect in the United States of America as of the date hereof.
pro rata
 
Neither the Trustee, any Holder nor any other Person shall have any obligation to enforce or exhaust any rights or remedies or take any other steps under any security for the Obligations or against the Company or any other Person or any Property of the Company or any other Person before the Trustee, such Holder or such other Person is entitled to demand payment and performance by any or all Guarantors of their liabilities and obligations under their Guarantee.
 
(1) To further evidence the Guarantee set forth in this Article IX, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Guarantee substantially in the form of Section 3.5 hereof shall be endorsed on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and executed by either manual or facsimile signature of an officer, manager or member, as applicable, of each Guarantor.

The Company may without the consent of the Holders, issue Additional Notes hereunder on the same terms and conditions (and having the same guarantors) and with the same CUSIP numbers as the Initial Notes, provided that if any Additional Notes are issued at a price that causes such Additional Notes to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations of the United States Department of Treasury thereunder (the "Code"), such Additional Notes shall not have the same CUSIP number as the Initial Notes.
(3) The Notes shall be issued only in fully registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
(1) Interest on the Notes will accrue at the per annum rate of 4.625%, subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.2(7) (the per annum rate at which the Notes shall bear interest at any time, the "Note Interest Rate"), and will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
(2) The Company shall pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year (each, an ","), commencing April 1, 2011.

(3) Interest shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date to the registered Holders of the Notes on the Regular Record Date.
(4) Amounts due on the Maturity Date or earlier Redemption Date or Change of Control Payment Date for the Notes will be payable, at the corporate trust office of the Trustee at 60 Livingston Avenue, Mail Code EP-MN W2ZW, St. Paul, Minnesota 55107-2292 or the office maintained from time to time by the Trustee in The City of New York. The Company may make payment of interest on an Interest Payment Date in respect of Notes in certificated form by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled to the payment as it appears in the Security Register or by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located in the United States. The Company shall make payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of Notes in book-entry form to DTC (as defined below) in immediately available funds, while disbursement of such payments to owners of beneficial interests in Notes in book-entry form will be made in accordance with the procedures of DTC and its participants in effect from time to time.
 
(5) Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall impose any service charge for any transfer or exchange of a Note. However, the Company may ask Holders of the Notes to pay any taxes or other governmental charges in connection with a transfer or exchange of Notes.
(6) If any Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Change of Control Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Company will make the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest on the next such Business Day as if it were made on the date payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after that Interest Payment Date, the Maturity Date or earlier Redemption Date or Change of Control Payment Date, as the case may be, to the next such Business Day.
(7) The Note Interest Rate will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody's (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) or S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes, as set forth in this Section 1.2(7).
(i) If the ratings from Moody's or S&P (or, in either case if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to the Notes (each, a "", and collectively, the "") is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table with respect to that Rating Agency, the Note Interest Rate will increase from 4.625% by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:

Rating Agencies
 
 
(ii) If at any time the Note Interest Rate has been adjusted upward as a result of a decrease in a rating by a Rating Agency and that Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating with respect to the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the Note Interest Rate will be decreased such that the interest rate per annum equals 4.625% plus the percentage set forth opposite the rating in effect immediately following the increase in the table above; that if Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "Baa3" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "BBB-" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the Note Interest Rate will be decreased to 4.625%.
provided
 
(iii) No adjustment in the Note Interest Rate shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the Notes, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Notes from another nationally recognized statistical rating organization, to the extent one exists, and if another nationally recognized statistical rating organization rates the Notes (such organization, as certified by a Board Resolution, a ""), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the Note Interest Rate pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating for the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's and S&P in such table and (c) the Note Interest Rate will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate per annum equals 4.625% plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above). For so long as (i) only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, any increase or decrease in the Note Interest Rate necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by that Rating Agency shall be twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above and (ii) no Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the Note Interest Rate will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 6.625%.
Substitute Rating Agency
(iv) Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency, shall be made independent of (and in addition to) any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the Note Interest Rate be reduced below 4.625% or (2) the Note Interest Rate exceed 6.625%.
(v) Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
(vi) The Note Interest Rate will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any Rating Agency) if the Notes become rated "A3" (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency) and "A-" (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if only rated by one Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the day that is 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day). Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Company, notice of which shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 10 days prior to the Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.

1. . This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its "4.625% Senior Notes due 2020" (herein called the ""), issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 20, 2007, as supplemented by that certain Sixth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 21, 2010 (the "" and herein with the Indenture, collectively, the ""), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The aggregate principal amount of Initial Notes Outstanding at any time may not exceed $450,000,000 in aggregate principal amount, except for, or in lieu of, other Notes of the Series pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture and except for any Notes which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered. Additional Notes of the same series of Securities as the Notes may be issued in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.1(2) of the Supplemental Indenture.
Indenture
Notes
Supplemental Indenture
Indenture
Trustee
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. In the event of a conflict between this Note and the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern.
2. . The Note Interest Rate will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody's (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) or S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Notes, as set forth below.
Interest Rate Adjustment
If the ratings from Moody's or S&P (or, in either case if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to the Notes (each, a "", and collectively, the "") is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table with respect to that Rating Agency, the Note Interest Rate will increase from 4.625% by the percentage set forth opposite that rating:
Rating Agency
Rating Agencies
 
 
 
If at any time the Note Interest Rate has been adjusted upward as a result of a decrease in a rating by a Rating Agency and that Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating with respect to the Notes to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the Note Interest Rate will be decreased such that the interest rate per annum equals 4.625% plus the percentage set forth opposite the rating in effect immediately following the increase in the table above; provided that if Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "Baa3" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher and S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency subsequently increases its rating of the Notes to "BBB-" (or its equivalent if with respect to any Substitute Rating Agency) or higher, the Note Interest Rate will be decreased to 4.625%.
No adjustment in the Note Interest Rate shall be made solely as a result of a Rating Agency ceasing to provide a rating. If at any time less than two Rating Agencies provide a rating of the Notes, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Notes from another nationally recognized statistical rating organization, to the extent one exists, and if another nationally recognized statistical rating organization rates the Notes (such organization, as certified by a Board Resolution, a ""), for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the Note Interest Rate pursuant to the table above (a) such Substitute Rating Agency will be substituted for the last Rating Agency to provide a rating for the Notes but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative ratings scale used by such Substitute Rating Agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the table above with respect to such Substitute Rating Agency, such ratings shall be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's and S&P in such table and (c) the Note Interest Rate will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate per annum equals 4.625% plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute Rating Agency in the table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above). For so long as (i) only one Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, any increase or decrease in the Note Interest Rate necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by that Rating Agency shall be twice the applicable percentage set forth in the table above and (ii) no Rating Agency provides a rating of the Notes, the Note Interest Rate will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 6.625%.
Substitute Rating Agency
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or any Substitute Rating Agency, shall be made independent of (and in addition to) any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (1) the Note Interest Rate be reduced below 4.625% or (2) the Note Interest Rate exceed 6.625%.
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
The Note Interest Rate will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any Rating Agency) if the Notes become rated "A3" (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody's (or any Substitute Rating Agency) and "A-" (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if only rated by one Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook.
 
3. . At any time prior to the Maturity Date, the Company may at its option redeem all or a part of the Notes upon not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior notice, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of any Notes being redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of unpaid interest accrued thereon to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year of twelve 30 day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points, plus, in each case, unpaid interest on the Notes to be redeemed, accrued to the Redemption Date.
Optional Redemption
4. . Except as provided in Sections 5 below, the Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Mandatory Redemption
5. . In the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Holders may require the Company to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.3 of the Supplemental Indenture, upon providing to the Company or any Paying Agent the completed Purchase Notice in the form on the reverse hereof or otherwise in accordance with the Applicable Procedures of the Depositary.
Change of Control Triggering Event
6. . If this Note is a Global Security, then, in the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Note, including an exchange, transfer, redemption, repurchase or conversion of this Note in part only, the Trustee, as custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the Applicable Procedures.

Defaults and Remedies
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, and, among other things, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Note for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or premium, if any, or interest hereon, on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note. Certain modifications or amendments to the Indenture require the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected.
Amendment, Supplement and Waiver
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair (without the consent of the Holder hereof) the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of any authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Note or Notes to be exchanged, at such office or agency of the Company. The Trustee upon such surrender by the Holder will issue the new Notes in the requested denominations. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

(1) The election of the Company to redeem any Notes shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the Notes, the Company shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be acceptable to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Notes selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

(iv) if less than all of the Outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the portions of the principal amounts) of the particular Notes to be redeemed;
(v) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Note to be redeemed and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date;
(vi) the place or places where such Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price;
(vii) the CUSIP numbers of such Notes, if any (or any other numbers used by the Depositary to identify such Notes); and
(viii) that, unless the Company defaults in paying the Redemption Price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes called for redemption on the Redemption Date.

(5) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Notes so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price) such Notes shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Note for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Note shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price; provided, however, that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Notes registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms.
If any Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal thereof shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate borne by the Note.
 
(6) Any Note which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at an office or agency in accordance with the notice of redemption (with, if the Company or the Trustee shall so require, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or other appropriate person), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Note, without service charge, a new Note or Notes of any authorized denominations as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Note so surrendered.

(1) Upon the occurrence of any Change of Control Triggering Event, each Holder of Notes shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer") on the terms set forth herein at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of purchase (the "").

(ii) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this Section 6.3 and that all Notes validly tendered will be accepted for payment;

provided
(4) The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with this Section 6.3, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Section 6.3 by virtue of such conflicts.
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all the Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer or (ii) prior to the occurrence of the related Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company has given written notice of a redemption as provided under Section 5.1 unless the Company has failed to pay the Redemption Price on the Redemption Date.
 
If, after the date of the Supplemental Indenture, any Subsidiary of the Company that is not then a Guarantor guarantees, becomes a borrower or guarantor under, or grants any Lien to secure any obligations pursuant to, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility, any refinancing or replacement thereof or any other indebtedness for borrowed money (including capital leases) having an aggregate principal amount outstanding in excess of 10% of the Company's Net Worth as of the end of the Company's most recent quarter for which financial statements are available (such Net Worth to be measured at the time of the incurrence of each such guarantee or borrowing or the granting of such Lien), then in any such case such Subsidiary will become a Guarantor by executing a supplemental indenture and delivering it to the Trustee within twenty Business Days of the date on which it guaranteed or incurred such Indebtedness or granted such Lien, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the preceding, any Guarantee by a Guarantor that was issued pursuant to this paragraph solely as a result of its guarantee or incurrence of, or granting of a Lien in respect of, any such indebtedness shall be automatically and unconditionally released upon the release or discharge of the guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Subsidiary's Guarantee (or upon such Subsidiary ceasing to be a borrower or the release of Liens granted by such Subsidiary, as the case may be), except a discharge or release as a result of payment under such guarantee, or of the refinancing or replacement of any such indebtedness that is guaranteed or incurred by such Guarantor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no SPE shall guarantee the Notes and no Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to guarantee the Notes unless it becomes a guarantor under, or grants any Lien to secure any obligations pursuant to such Revolving Credit Facility or Term Loan Facility, or any refinancing or replacement thereof.
 
Section 901 of the Indenture shall, with respect to the Notes, be replaced in its entirety with the following:
"Without the consent of any Holders of the Notes, the Company and the Guarantors, when authorized by a Board Resolution, together with the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may modify and amend the Indenture, this Supplemental Indenture and the terms of the Notes to:

(2) add to the covenants of the Company or the Guarantors for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or the Guarantors under this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes;
(3) add any additional Events of Default;
(4) secure the Notes;
(5) provide for a successor Trustee with respect to the Notes and add or change any of the provisions of the Indenture or the Supplemental Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts thereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 611 of the Indenture;
(6) add or release a Guarantor as required or permitted by this Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture;
 
(7) cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; or
(8) make any other amendment or supplement to this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes, as long as that amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of any Notes in any material respect (to be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel).
No amendment to this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes made solely to conform this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes to the Description of the Notes and Description of Debt Securities contained in the Company's prospectus supplement and prospectus, each dated September 14, 2010 and relating to the Notes, shall be deemed to adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the Notes."
 
The first paragraph, including clauses (1) through (5) thereof, of Section 902 of the Indenture shall, with respect to the Notes, be replaced with the following:
"With the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, the Guarantors and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for purpose adding any provisions to or changing an any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture or the Notes or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby:
(1) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, any Note;
(3) reduce the principal of, or rate of interest on, any Note;
(4) reduce any amount payable upon the redemption or purchase at the option of the Holder of any Note;

(6) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on, or with respect to, any Note on or after the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date;
(7) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Guarantee, the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture; or
 
(8) reduce the percentage in principal amount of Outstanding Notes the consent of whose Holders is required for modification or amendment of the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for waiver of compliance with provisions of the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or waiver of defaults, in each case, with respect to or in respect of provisions hereof and thereof that cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby."
The second paragraph of Section 902 of the Indenture shall, with respect to the Notes, add the following as the last sentence thereto:
"In addition, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may, on behalf of the Holders of all Notes waive compliance with the Company's covenants described under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this Supplemental Indenture."
 
Section 801 of the Indenture shall, with respect to the Notes be replaced with the following:
"The Company shall not in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, consolidate or merge with or into any other Person, permit any other Person to consolidate with or merge into the Company or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person, unless:
(1) the Company is the surviving entity or, the Person formed by such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or the Person to which all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company are conveyed, transferred or leased, as the case may be, shall be an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and shall expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on the Outstanding Notes and the performance and observance of every covenant of this Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or observed;
(2) immediately after giving effect to any such transaction and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as a result of such transaction as having been incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company at the time of such transaction, there shall not be any Event of Default or event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default;
(3) if, as a result of any such transaction, the properties or assets of the Company would become subject to a Lien which would not be permitted under Section 6.1 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company or such successor Person, as the case may be, shall take those steps that are necessary to secure all the Outstanding Notes equally and ratably with Indebtedness secured by that Lien; and
 
(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the consummation of the particular consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease under this Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture have been complied with."
 
Section 802 shall, with respect to the Notes, be replaced with the following:
"Upon any consolidation or merger by the Company with or into any other Person or any conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company to any other Person in accordance with Section 8.1, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or merger or to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person has been named as the Company herein, and thereafter, except in the case of a lease to another Person, the predecessor Person shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under the Indenture, this Supplemental Indenture and the Notes (to the extent the Company was the predecessor Person)."
Article 15 of the Indenture shall not be applicable to the Notes.
 
(1) For value received, each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally, fully, unconditionally and absolutely guarantees (each a "Guarantee") to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes or the obligations of the Company or any other Guarantor to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder, that (a) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be duly and punctually paid in full when due, whether at maturity, upon redemption, by acceleration or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest, if any, on the Notes and all other obligations of the Company or the Guarantor to the Holders of or the Trustee under this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes hereunder (including fees, expenses or others) (collectively, the "Obligations") will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture and the Notes; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. If the Company shall fail to pay when due, or to perform, any Obligations, for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be obligated to pay, or to perform or cause the performance of, the same promptly. An Event of Default under this Supplemental Indenture or the Notes shall entitle the Holders of the Notes to accelerate the Obligations of the Guarantor hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the Obligations of the Company.
 
(2) Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes, this Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions of this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes, any release of any other Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same, whether or not a Guarantee is affixed to any particular Note, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor.
(3) Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of the Notes and the Trustee, on the other hand, (a) the maturity of the Obligations may be accelerated as provided in Section 502 of the Indenture and Article IV of this Supplemental Indenture for the purposes of the Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Obligations, and (b) in the event of any acceleration of such Obligations as provided in Section 502 of the Indenture and Article IV of this Supplemental Indenture, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantor for the purposes of its Guarantee.
 
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its Guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.
 
Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes to the security, if any, held for payment of the Obligations.
 
Subject to Section 9.10 of this Supplemental Indenture, the obligations of each of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes, any other guarantee or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations).
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Company or any other Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Company, other than final payment in full in cash of the Obligations. Each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of each of the Guarantors against the Company or any security.
 
Subject to Section 9.10 of this Supplemental Indenture, each of the Guarantors further agrees that its Guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company.
 
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right of each of the Guarantors by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each of the Guarantors hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee or any Holder of the Notes, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Holders in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligations, and thereupon the Holders shall, assign (except to the extent that such assignment would render a Guarantor a "creditor" of the Company within the meaning of Section 547 of Title 11 of the United States Code as now in effect or hereafter amended or any comparable provision of any successor statute) the amount of the Obligations owed to it and paid by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guarantee to such Guarantor, such assignment to be to the extent the Obligations in question were discharged by such Guarantor, or make such other disposition thereof as such Guarantor shall direct (all without recourse to the Holders, and without any representation or warranty by the Holders). If (a) a Guarantor shall make payment to the Holders of all or any part of the Obligations and (b) all the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Supplemental Indenture shall be paid in full, the Trustee will, at such Guarantor's request, execute and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the Obligations resulting from such payment by such Guarantor.
pro rata
 
Each of the Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Company's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each of the Guarantors assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes will have no duty to advise the Guarantors of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Holders, as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against the Company, arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise, shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations to the Trustee; , , that any right of subrogation that such Guarantor may have pursuant to this Supplemental Indenture is subject to Section 9.7 hereof.
provided
however
 
(1) A Guarantor shall, upon the occurrence of any of the following events, be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all obligations under this Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee without any action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, that such Guarantor would not, immediately after such release and discharge, be required to become a Guarantor pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof if such Guarantor had incurred its then-existing guarantees, indebtedness for borrowed money (including capital leases) and Liens at the time of such release and discharge:
provided
(i) upon notice by the Company to the Trustee, at any time such Guarantor is not a borrower or guarantor under, and has not granted any then-existing Lien to secure any obligations pursuant to, the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility, any refinancing or replacement thereof (including as a result of any release from such obligations in connection with (x) a Guarantor ceasing to be a "material subsidiary" as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility, any refinancing or replacement thereof or (y) any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock or assets of a Guarantor), and all other indebtedness for borrowed money (including capital leases) having an aggregate principal amount outstanding in excess of 10% of the Company's Net Worth and is released or discharged from each guarantee and Lien granted by such Guarantor with respect to all such indebtedness (other than obligations arising under the Indenture and any Securities issued thereunder) except where resulting from a discharge or release as a result of payment under such guarantee; or
(ii) upon the occurrence of the circumstances described in the penultimate sentence of Section 6.4 hereof, of which the Company shall promptly notify the Trustee.
(2) A Guarantor shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all obligations under this Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee without any action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder upon any Covenant Defeasance or Defeasance with respect to the Notes, subject to reinstatement pursuant to Section 1306 of the Indenture.
(3) The Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release upon receipt of a request of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate certifying as to the compliance with this Section. Any Guarantor not so released will remain liable for the full amount of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes provided in this Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee.
 
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance hereof each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee by such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Title 11 of the United States Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Holders and such Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Supplemental Indenture and its Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount which, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor, and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of, any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under this Supplemental Indenture, will result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting such fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor in a amount based on the net assets of each Guarantor, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect in the United States of America as of the date hereof.
pro rata
 
Neither the Trustee, any Holder nor any other Person shall have any obligation to enforce or exhaust any rights or remedies or take any other steps under any security for the Obligations or against the Company or any other Person or any Property of the Company or any other Person before the Trustee, such Holder or such other Person is entitled to demand payment and performance by any or all Guarantors of their liabilities and obligations under their Guarantee.
 
(1) To further evidence the Guarantee set forth in this Article IX, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Guarantee substantially in the form of Section 3.5 hereof shall be endorsed on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and executed by either manual or facsimile signature of an officer, manager or member, as applicable, of each Guarantor.
(2) Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in this Article IX shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Guarantee.
(3) If an officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on this Supplemental Indenture or a Guarantee no longer holds that office or is no longer a manager or member, as applicable, at the time the Trustee authenticates such Guarantee or at any time thereafter, such Guarantor's Guarantee of such Note shall be valid nevertheless.
 
(4) The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of any Guarantee set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of each Guarantor.
 
Unless otherwise released and discharged from its obligations in accordance with this Supplemental Indenture, upon any consolidation or merger by any Guarantor with or into any other Person, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or merger shall sign a supplemental indenture and guarantee and succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Guarantor under this Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person has been named as a Guarantor herein, and thereafter the predecessor Person shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under the Indenture, this Supplemental Indenture and the Notes (to the extent the Guarantor was the predecessor Person).
 
The provisions of Article Thirteen of the Indenture shall be applicable to the Notes. For purposes of the foregoing, the phrase "and any covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(19)" appearing in the first sentence of Section 1303 of the Indenture, and words of like import appearing throughout the Indenture in furtherance of the application of the provisions of Article Thirteen of the Indenture to the Notes, shall be deemed to refer explicitly to the provisions of Articles VI (exclusive of Section 6.3 thereof to which the provisions of Article Thirteen of the Indenture shall not apply) and VIII of this Supplemental Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed all as of the day and year first above written.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Interactive Technologies, Inc., a New Jersey Corporation (the ""), solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain Indenture, dated as of November 20, 2007 (the ""), by and among Fiserv, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the ""), the Guarantor, the other guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the ""), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.125% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "") and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "," and collectively, with the 2015 Notes, the ""). The Notes are guaranteed (the "") by certain subsidiaries of the Company, including the Guarantor, and have been issued under the Indenture, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture, among the Company, the Guarantor, the other guarantors named therein and the Trustee, establishing the terms and providing for the issuance of the 2015 Notes and the Guaranty (the ""), and by a supplemental indenture, among the Company, the Guarantor, the other guarantors named therein and the Trustee, establishing the terms and providing for the issuance of the 2020 Notes and the Guaranty (the "" and together with the 2015 Supplemental Indenture, the ""). In connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, the Company prepared a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-169358) (the ""), including the prospectus constituting a part thereof, dated September 14, 2010, and the supplement to the prospectus, dated September 14, 2010 (collectively, the ""), filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""). In our capacity as counsel to the Guarantor, we have been asked to render the opinion set forth in this letter and, in connection therewith, we have reviewed the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures, including their exhibits and schedules, and each of the following documents:
Guarantor
Indenture
Company
Trustee
2015 Notes
2020 Notes
Notes
Guaranty
2015 Supplemental Indenture
2020 Supplemental Indenture

In addition, we have examined such other agreements and documents and such records of the Guarantor that we have considered appropriate including, without limitation, minutes and resolutions, verified copies of official records of various state and governmental authorities with respect to the organization of the Guarantor, and such laws, regulations, court decisions and proceedings that we deemed necessary or appropriate. We have also made such other inquiries and examinations as we deemed appropriate in order to render this opinion.
We have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies. We have also assumed, without verification, the legal capacity of each individual who has executed documents or instruments in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
We have also assumed, without verification (i) that the parties to the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures, other than the Guarantor, have the power and authority to enter into and perform the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures, (ii) the due authorization, execution and delivery by parties other than the Guarantor of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures, and (iii) that the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each such other party, enforceable against such other party in accordance with their terms, subject to the same qualifications to which the enforceability of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures against the Guarantor are subject.
We have relied as to factual matters on the representations and warranties contained in the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures. We have not, except as specifically identified in this opinion letter, undertaken any independent investigation, review or research in connection with any matters addressed herein, and any limited inquiry undertaken by us during the preparation of this opinion should not be regarded as such an investigation, review or research.
Members of our Firm are admitted to the Bar in the State of New Jersey and we express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New Jersey and the federal laws of the United States.
The opinions set forth herein are subject to the following additional assumptions, qualifications and limitations:
(a) We express no opinion as to the effect on the enforceability of rights and remedies created by the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium, bulk sales, fraudulent transfer, receivership, and similar laws from time to time in effect of general application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors or secured parties. We express no opinion as to the enforceability of cumulative remedies to the extent such cumulative remedies purport to or would have the effect of compensating the party entitled to the benefits thereof in amounts in excess of the actual loss suffered by such party or would violate applicable laws concerning election of remedies.
 
(b) We have assumed and relied upon, without independent investigation: (i) that the parties to the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures are in full compliance with the terms of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures and that such parties will perform all of their obligations thereunder; and (ii) that any action taken by any party to the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures in connection with the performance or enforcement of the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures will be lawful, commercially reasonable and taken in good faith and that such party will seek to enforce its rights only in circumstances and in a manner in which it is equitable and commercially reasonable to do so and otherwise in accordance with applicable law.
(c) We have assumed that the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures expresses the entire agreement with respect to the subject matter thereof and that no other agreements or dealings among the parties thereto affect the validity or enforceability of the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures.
(d) We have assumed that consideration exists to support the Guaranty made by the Guarantor.
(e) Our opinion is subject to limitations imposed by general principles of equity upon the specific enforceability of any of the remedies, covenants or other provisions of the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures and the availability of injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, and the application of general principles of equity including, without limitation, the concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in proceedings at law or in equity). The use of the term "enforceable" shall not imply any opinion as to the availability of equitable remedies, including without limitation the remedies of specific performance or injunctive relief, nor is any opinion regarding those remedies intended to be expressed herein.
(f) Certain rights, remedies, stipulations, waivers and other provisions contained in the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures may be unenforceable, rendered ineffective or limited by applicable laws, judicial decisions, constitutional requirements or principles of equity governing such provisions; however, such laws, judicial decisions, constitutional requirements and principles of equity do not render the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures invalid as a whole, and there exist in the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures or pursuant to applicable law legally adequate remedies for a practical realization of the principal benefits purported to be provided by the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures, subject to the economic consequences of any delay which may result from applicable laws, rules, judicial decisions or constitutional requirements.
(g) Under certain circumstances, the provision that a failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy will not impair or waive such right or remedy may be unenforceable to the extent that an oral agreement has been effected or a course of dealing has occurred modifying such provision. We express no opinion as to the validity or enforceability of provisions of the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures precluding oral waivers or modifications of provisions of the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures, or relating to waivers of equitable rights or defenses, or precluding the assertion of certain claims or defenses or from obtaining certain rights or remedies, or relating to waivers that are prohibited under or are contrary to the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect on the date hereof in the State of New Jersey (the "").
UCC
 
(h) No opinion is expressed as to the enforceability of any provisions of the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures which (1) relate to service of process; (2) relate to subrogation, severability or the exercise of private power of sale; (3) relate to waiver of the right to a jury; (4) purport to restrict venue or jurisdiction; (5) purport to establish evidentiary standards; (6) relate to or provide for waivers of remedies (or the delay or omission of enforcement thereof), disclaimers, liability limitations with respect to third parties, releases of legal or equitable rights, discharge of defenses or liquidated damages; (7) purport to permit a lender to increase the rate of interest or to collect a late charge in the event of delinquency or default; (8) purport to grant to a lender a power or a warrant of attorney to confess judgment for indebtedness; (9) permit a lender to sell or dispose of any collateral securing the loans made pursuant to the Indenture or the Supplemental Indentures otherwise than in compliance with the UCC and other applicable laws; (10) purport to require that waivers must be in writing; (11) relate to partial foreclosure; (12) relate to or provide for choice of governing laws, which choice may be qualified by judicial decisions; (13) purport to entitle a lender to exercise self-help remedies or to take possession of collateral in any manner other than peaceably and by reason of the peaceable surrender of such possession by the party in possession of such collateral or by reason of appropriate judicial proceedings; (14) purport to entitle a lender to the appointment of a receiver as a matter of right; (15) purport to be waivers of the obligations of good faith, fair dealing, diligence, mitigation of damages or commercial reasonableness; (16) purport to assign to a lender the rights of any person or entity in connection with the bankruptcy of another; or (17) purport to entitle a party to attorneys' fees.
(i) Our opinion is based upon and relies upon the current status of the laws of the State of New Jersey and the applicable federal laws to the extent specifically set forth herein and in all respects is subject to and may be limited by future legislation and case law.
(j) We express no opinion whatsoever as to status of title to or a party's interest in any property described as collateral, or the due recordation or filing of any document, or the priority of any liens.
(k) No opinion is expressed herein with respect to (1) federal securities laws and regulations administered by the SEC, state "Blue Sky" laws and regulations, and laws and regulations relating to commodity (and other) futures and indices and other similar instruments; (2) pension and employee benefit laws and regulations (, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended); (3) federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws and regulations; (4) federal and state tax laws and regulations; (5) federal and state racketeering laws and regulations (, RICO); (6) federal and state health and safety laws and regulations ( OSHA); (7) federal and state labor laws and regulations; (8) other federal and state statutes of general application to the extent they provide for criminal prosecution ( mail fraud and wire fraud statutes); (9) federal and state laws, regulations and policies concerning (a) national and local emergency, (b) possible judicial deference to acts of sovereign states and (c) criminal forfeiture laws; (10) federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations or permits or licenses that may be used thereunder; (11) federal, state and local securities, land use and subdivision laws and regulations (including without limitation, any applicable building or zoning laws, ordinances or regulations); and (12) the statutes and ordinances, administrative decisions and the rules and regulations of counties, towns, municipalities and special political subdivisions (whether created or enabled through legislative action at the federal, state or regional level), and judicial decisions to the extent that they deal with any of the foregoing.

(l) We express no opinion as to any matter not specifically included in the following numbered paragraph.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that:
1. Assuming that each of the 2015 Supplemental Indenture and the 2020 Supplemental Indenture (i) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (ii) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represent the valid and binding obligations of, the Trustee, and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that the Guaranty issued by the Guarantor, when such Guaranty is delivered in the manner and for the consideration contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will be validly issued and will constitute the valid, legal and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in this opinion letter, including, without limitation, (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other similar laws of general application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and (ii) general principles of equity, regardless of whether applied in a proceeding in equity or at law.
This opinion is rendered as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to advise you of any changes in the foregoing subsequent to the delivery of this opinion letter.

In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are "experts" within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act or within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act.
