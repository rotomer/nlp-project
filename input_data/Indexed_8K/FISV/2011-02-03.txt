For Immediate Release
 
 Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), the leading global provider of financial services technology solutions, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010.
Brookfield, Wis., February 3, 2011
GAAP revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $1.08 billion compared with $1.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. Adjusted revenue increased 2 percent to $1.03 billion in the fourth quarter compared with $1.01 billion in 2009. For the full year, GAAP revenue was $4.13 billion compared with $4.08 billion in 2009, and adjusted revenue increased 1 percent from $3.87 billion in 2009 to $3.93 billion in 2010.
GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.80, which includes a loss from early debt extinguishment of $0.11 per share, compared with $0.83 in 2009. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year was $3.34 compared with $3.04 in 2009.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We supplement our reporting of revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share information determined in accordance with GAAP by using "adjusted revenue," "adjusted operating income," "adjusted income from continuing operations," "adjusted earnings per share," "adjusted operating margin," "free cash flow" and "adjusted internal revenue growth" in this earnings release. Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other revenue or expense items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses enhance our shareholders' ability to evaluate our performance because such items do not reflect how we manage our operations. Therefore, we exclude these items from GAAP revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share to calculate these non-GAAP measures.
Examples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, severance costs, merger and integration expenses and non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions. We exclude these items to more clearly focus on the factors we believe are pertinent to the management of our operations, and we use this information to allocate resources to our various businesses.
Free cash flow and adjusted internal revenue growth are non-GAAP financial measures and are described on pages 10 and 12. We believe free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for strategic capital decisions. Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, as adjusted for other items as listed on page 10. We believe adjusted internal revenue growth percentage is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding acquired revenue, postage reimbursements in our Output Solutions business and deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. We believe this supplemental information enhances our shareholders' ability to evaluate and understand our core business performance.
These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures reflect management's judgment of particular items and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
