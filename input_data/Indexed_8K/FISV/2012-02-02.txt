Press Release
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We supplement our reporting of revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share information determined in accordance with GAAP by using "adjusted revenue," "adjusted operating income," "adjusted income from continuing operations," "adjusted earnings per share," "adjusted operating margin," "free cash flow" and "adjusted internal revenue growth" in this earnings release. Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other expenses and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses enhance our shareholders' ability to evaluate our performance because such items do not reflect how we manage our operations. Therefore, we exclude these items from GAAP revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share to calculate these non-GAAP measures.
Examples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, severance costs, charges associated with early debt extinguishment, merger costs, certain integration expenses related to acquisitions and certain costs associated with the achievement of the company's operational effectiveness objectives. We exclude these items to more clearly focus on the factors we believe are pertinent to the management of our operations, and we use this information to allocate resources to our various businesses.
Free cash flow and adjusted internal revenue growth are non-GAAP financial measures and are described on page 12. We believe free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for strategic capital decisions. We believe adjusted internal revenue growth is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding all acquired revenue and postage reimbursements in our Output Solutions business. We believe this supplemental information enhances our shareholders' ability to evaluate and understand our core business performance.
These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, income from continuing operations and earnings per share or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures reflect management's judgment of particular items and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding anticipated adjusted earnings per share, adjusted revenue growth and adjusted internal revenue growth. Statements can generally be identified as forward-looking because they include words such as "believes," "anticipates," "expects," "could," "should" or words of similar meaning. Statements that describe the company's future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. The factors that may affect the company's results include, among others: the impact on the company's business of the current state of the economy, including the risk of reduction in revenue resulting from decreased spending on the products and services that the company offers or from the elimination of existing or potential clients due to consolidation or financial failures in the financial services industry; legislative and regulatory actions in the United States, including the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related regulations, and internationally; the company's ability to successfully integrate recent acquisitions into the company's operations; changes in client demand for the company's products or services; pricing or other actions by competitors; the impact of the company's strategic initiatives; the company's ability to comply with government regulations, including privacy regulations; and other factors included in the company's filings with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and in other documents that the company files with the SEC.
