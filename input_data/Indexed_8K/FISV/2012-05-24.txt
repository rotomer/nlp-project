On May 23, 2012, Fiserv, Inc. ("Fiserv") filed Articles of Amendment to its Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Amendment") as well as Restated Articles of Incorporation reflecting the Amendment with the State of Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions after Fiserv's shareholders approved the Amendment. The Amendment eliminates the classified structure of Fiserv's board of directors and provides for an annual election of directors as set forth below. The Amendment provides that directors who have been elected to three-year terms prior to the annual meeting of shareholders held in 2013 will complete those terms. Beginning with the annual meeting of shareholders held in 2013, and at all annual meetings thereafter, directors whose terms are expiring will be subject to election for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting. As a result, directors whose terms expire in 2013, 2014 and 2015 will first be elected for one-year terms beginning in those respective years. Beginning with the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders, the entire board of directors will be elected annually. A copy of the Amendment as well as Fiserv's Restated Articles of Incorporation reflecting the Amendment are filed as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein.
Fiserv's board of directors has approved an amendment to Fiserv's by-laws that conforms provisions relating to the election of directors to those set forth in the Amendment. The amendment to Fiserv's by-laws did not require any shareholder action and became effective at the same time as the Amendment. A copy of the amendment to the by-laws as well as Fiserv's by-laws as amended and restated are filed as Exhibits 3.3 and 3.4, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 3.2
Pursuant to Section 180.1007 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, these Restated Articles of Incorporation of Fiserv, Inc. shall supersede and take the place of the existing Restated Articles of Incorporation and any amendments thereto:
The name of the corporation is Fiserv, Inc.
The Corporation is incorporated under the provisions of Chapter 180 of the Wisconsin Statutes.
The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 475,000,000 shares, of which 450,000,000 shares shall be designated Common Stock, having a par value of $.01 per share; and 25,000,000 shares shall be designated as Preferred Stock, having no par value per share. Authority is hereby vested in the Board of Directors from time to time to issue the Preferred Stock as Preferred Stock in one or more series of any number of shares and, in connection with the creation of such series, to fix, by resolution providing for the use of shares thereof, the voting rights, if any; the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of such series in respect to the rate of dividend, the price, the terms and conditions of redemption; the amounts payable upon such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation; sinking fund provisions for the redemption or purchase of such series of shares; and, if the shares of any series are issued with the privilege of conversation, the terms and conditions on which such series of shares may be converted. In addition to the foregoing, to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by Wisconsin law, in connection with each issue thereof, the Board of Directors may at its discretion assign to any series of the Preferred Stock such other terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations, rights and privileges as it may deem appropriate. The aggregate number of preferred shares issued and not cancelled of any and all preferred series shall not exceed the total number of shares of Preferred Stock hereinabove authorized. Each series of Preferred Stock shall be distinctively designated by letter or descriptive words or both.
Section 1. . There is designated a series of Preferred Stock titled as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock," no par value per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), and the authorized number of shares constituting the Series A Preferred Stock shall be 3,000,000. Such number of authorized shares may be increased or decreased, from time to time, by resolution of the Board, provided, however, that no such decrease shall reduce the number of authorized shares of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, plus the number of such shares then reserved for issuance upon the exercise of any outstanding options, warrants or rights or the exercise of any conversion or exchange privilege contained in any outstanding security issued by the Corporation.

Section 2. .
Dividends and Distributions
(A) Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any other series of Preferred Stock (or shares of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation) ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of Common Stock and of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available therefor, such dividends, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock. In the event the Company shall at any time after February 23, 1998 (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) The Board shall declare, out of funds legally available therefor, a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock, as provided in paragraph (A) of the Section 2, immediately after it has declared a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock).
Section 3. . In addition to any other voting rights required by applicable law, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
(A) Each share of the Series A Preferred stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation. The multiple of 100 (the "Voting Multiple") set forth in the preceding sentence shall be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided in this paragraph (A). In the event that the Corporation shall at any time after the effective date of this Resolution of the Board ("Resolution") (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then, in each case, the Voting Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the number of votes per share to which the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled shall be the Voting Multiple in effect immediately prior to such even multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B) Except as otherwise provided in the Resolution, in any other resolution establishing another series of Preferred Stock (or any series of any other class of capital stock of the Corporation) or by applicable law, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of the Common Stock and the holders of any class of capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation.
(C) Except as otherwise provided in the Resolution or by applicable law, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent provided in paragraph (B) of the Section 3 for the taking of any corporate action.

(iii) Redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of any class of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation) to the Series A Preferred Stock, except that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of such junior stock in exchange for other shares of any class of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior (both as to dividends and upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or
(iv) Purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock or any shares of any class of capital stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation) with the Series A Preferred Stock, or redeem any shares of such parity stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication to the holders of all such shares upon such terms and conditions as the Board, after taking into consideration the respective annual dividend rates and the other relative powers, preferences and rights of the respective series and classes of such shares, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective holders of shares of all such series and classes.
 
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of any class of capital stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.

In the case of any Demand Special Meeting, such meeting shall be held at such date and time as may be designated by whichever of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President shall have called such meeting upon a demand in accordance with this Section 3; provided, however, that the date of any Demand Special Meeting shall be not more than seventy days after the Meeting Record Date (as defined in Section 6(a) of this Article II); and provided further that in the event that the directors, Chairman of the Board or President then in office fail(s) to designate a date and time for a Demand Special Meeting within ten days after the date that valid written demands for such meeting by the holders of record as of the Demand Record Date of shares representing at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the Demand Special Meeting, calculated as if the Demand Record Date were the record date for the Demand Special Meeting, are delivered to the Corporation (the "Delivery Date"), then such meeting shall be held at 10:00 A.M., local time, on the 100th day after the Delivery Date or, if such 100th day is not a Business Day, on the first preceding Business Day. In fixing a meeting date for any Special Meeting or Demand Special Meeting, the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President may consider such factors as it, he or she deems relevant within the good faith exercise of its, his or her business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the action proposed to be taken, the facts and circumstances surrounding any demand for such meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President to call an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting for the conduct of related business.
 
(f) The Corporation may engage regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as an agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any purported written demand or demands for a Demand Special Meeting received by the Secretary. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no purported demand shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Corporation until the earlier of (i) five Business Days following receipt by the Secretary of such purported demand and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid demands received by the Secretary represent at least 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the Demand Special Meeting, calculated as if the Demand Record Date were the record date for the Demand Special Meeting. Nothing contained in this Section 3(f) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the President or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any demand, whether during or after such five Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto).

In the case of any proposed nomination for election or re-election as a director, the Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
For purposes of these By-Laws, the term "Share Information" shall mean (1) the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned, directly or indirectly, of record and/or beneficially by a shareholder, any beneficial owner on whose behalf the shareholder is acting and any of their respective Affiliates, (2) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument') directly or indirectly owned beneficially by such shareholder, any such beneficial owner and any of their respective Affiliates, and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation, (3) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which such shareholder has a right to vote any shares of any security of the Corporation, (4) any short interest in any security of the Corporation (for purposes of this By-Law a Person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such Person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (5) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by such shareholder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (6) any proportionate interest in shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which such shareholder or beneficial owner is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (7) any performance-related fees (other than asset-based fee) that such shareholder, any such beneficial owner and any of their respective affiliates are entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of such Person's immediate family sharing the same household.
 
(iii) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of the foregoing Section 5(a)(ii) to the contrary, if the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation at least forty-five days prior to the Anniversary Date, then a shareholder's notice required by this Section 5 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
(b) . Only such business shall be conducted at a Special Meeting as shall have been described in the Corporation's notice of meeting sent to shareholders pursuant to the foregoing Section 4. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a Special Meeting at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such Special Meeting, by any shareholder of the Corporation who (A) is a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 5(b) and until and at the time of such Special Meeting, (B) is entitled to vote with respect to such nominations at the meeting under the Articles of Incorporation and (C) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 5(b) as to such nomination. In the event the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President calls a Special Meeting for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any shareholder permitted to nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence who desires to nominate persons for election to such position(s) at such a Special Meeting as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting shall cause a written notice described in Section 5(a)(ii) of this Article II (as if the nomination related to an Annual Meeting) to be received by the Secretary at the principal offices of the Corporation not earlier than ninety days prior to such Special Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (I) the 60th day prior to such Special Meeting and (II) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of such Special Meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of a Special Meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
Special Meetings
(c) .
General
(i) Only persons who are nominated by the Board of Directors or in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5 shall be eligible to be elected as directors at an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting. Only such business shall be conducted at an Annual Meeting or a Special Meeting, other than a Demand Special Meeting, as shall have been brought before such meeting by the Board of Directors or in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5. Only such business shall be conducted at a Demand Special Meeting as shall have been set forth in the statement of purpose of the demands received by the Corporation in accordance with Section 3 of this Article II or as shall have been brought before the Demand Special Meeting as determined by the Board of Directors. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power

Section 6
Fixing of Record Date
(a) The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date not less than ten days and not more than seventy days prior to the date of an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"). In the case of any Demand Special Meeting, (i) the Meeting Record Date shall be not later than the 30th day after the Delivery Date and (ii) if the Board of Directors fails to fix the Meeting Record Date within thirty days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on such 30th day shall be the Meeting Record Date. The shareholders of record on the Meeting Record Date shall be the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting, Special Meeting or Demand Special Meeting. When a determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at the Annual Meeting, Special Meeting or Demand Special Meeting has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall be applied to any adjournment thereof unless the Board of Directors fixes a new Meeting Record Date and except as otherwise required by law. A new Meeting Record Date must be set if a meeting is adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty days after the date fixed for the original meeting.
(b) The Board of Directors may also fix in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to take any other action or determining shareholders for any other purpose other than those set forth in Section 3(a) of this Article II and the foregoing Section 6(a). Such record date shall not be more than seventy days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If the Board of Directors does not fix a record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive a share dividend or distribution (other than a distribution involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the Corporation's shares), then the close of business on the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors is adopted declaring the dividend or distribution shall be the record date.
 
(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date to determine the shareholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting (the "Consent Record Date"). The Consent Record Date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and such date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the Consent Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any shareholder or shareholders of record who are seeking to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation by hand or by certified registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a Consent Record Date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such a valid request is received and verified, adopt a resolution fixing the Consent Record Date and shall make a public announcement of such Consent Record Date. If no Consent Record Date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten days after the date on which such a request is received and verified by the Secretary, then the Consent Record Date shall be the 10th day after the first date on which a valid written request to set a Consent Record Date is received and verified by the Secretary. To be valid, such written request shall comply with each of the following:
(i) Such written request shall be signed by one or more shareholders of record and by the beneficial owners or owners, if any, on whose behalf the shareholder or shareholders are acting, shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and shall set forth: (A) the name and address, as they appear on this Corporation's books, of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner who seeks to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting; (B) the Share Information; (C) a representation that each such shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the Corporation entitled to vote under the Articles of Incorporation at a meeting of shareholders with respect to each matter for which such shareholder is seeking to have shareholders express consent to corporate action in a writing without a meeting; (D) any other information relating to such shareholder and any such beneficial owner that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (E) the manner in which each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner intend to comply with Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act in seeking to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting; (F) in the case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to elect or re-elect a director by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, (1) the name and residence address of the person or persons each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director,
 
(2) a description of all agreements, arrangements or understandings between each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and each person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director and any other Person or Persons (naming such Person or Persons) pursuant to which such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect such person as a director including without limitation any arrangement or understanding with any Person as to how such person, if elected or re-elected as a director of the Corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question, (3) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and their respective Affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director, and his or her respective Affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including, without limitation, all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 promulgated under Regulation S-K if such shareholder and any such beneficial owner, or any Affiliate or associate thereof or Person acting in concert therewith, were the "registrant" for purposes of such rule and the person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director were a director or executive officer of such registrant, (4) such other information regarding each person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for contested elections of directors, or would be otherwise required to be disclosed, in each case pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (5) the written consent of each such person to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected; (G) in the case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to remove a director by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, (1) the names of the director(s) each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to remove and (2) the reasons of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner for asserting that such director(s) may be removed for cause; and (H) in the case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to authorize or take any other corporate action by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, (1) a brief description of the corporate action desired to be authorized or taken and, if such corporate action includes an amendment to these By-Laws, the language of the proposed amendment, (2) the reasons of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner for authorizing or taking such corporate action, (3) any material interest in such corporate action of each such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and (4) a description of all agreements, arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any such beneficial owner and any other Person or Persons (naming such Person or Persons) in connection with the corporate action desired to be authorized or taken by such shareholder. In the case of any such shareholder and any such beneficial owner seeking to elect or re-elect a director by the shareholders expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Corporation may require any person such shareholder and any such beneficial owner are seeking to elect or re-elect as a director to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such person to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such person.
 
(ii) Such written request shall be accompanied by a written agreement, which may require furnishing of a bond, signed by each Consent Soliciting Shareholder (as defined below) pursuant to which each Consent Soliciting Shareholder, jointly and severally, agrees to pay the Corporation's costs relating to such Consent Soliciting Shareholder seeking to have the shareholders express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, including the costs of preparing and mailing proxy materials for the Corporation's own solicitation, provided that if the Consent Soliciting Shareholder obtains the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents (as defined in Section 11(b) of this Article II) to express the corporate action referred to therein in accordance with these By-Laws, then the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall not be required to pay such costs. For purposes of these By-Laws, "Consent Soliciting Shareholder" shall mean each of the following Persons: (A) if the number of shareholders signing the Consent or Consents is ten or fewer, each Person signing any such Consents; or (B) if the number of shareholders signing the Consent or Consents is more than ten, each Person who either (1) was a Participant in any Solicitation of such consent or consents or (2) at the time of the delivery to the Corporation of the documents described in this Section 6(c) had engaged or intends to engage in any Solicitation of Consents and/or Proxies for expressing consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting (other than a Solicitation of Consents and/or Proxies on behalf of the Corporation).
A "Consent Soliciting Shareholder" shall also mean each Affiliate of a Consent Soliciting Shareholder described in clause (A) or (B) above who is a member of such Consent Soliciting Shareholder's "group" for purposes of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange Act, and any other Affiliate of such a Consent Soliciting Shareholder, if a majority of the directors then in office determine, reasonably and in good faith, that such Affiliate should be required to sign the written notice described in the foregoing Section 6(c)(i) and/or the written agreements described in this Section 6(c)(ii) and the following Section 6(c)(iii) to prevent the purposes of this Section 6(c) and Section 11 of this Article II from being evaded.
(iii) Such written request shall be accompanied by a written agreement signed by each Consent Soliciting Shareholder pursuant to which each Consent Soliciting Shareholder agrees to deliver to any inspectors of election engaged by the Corporation pursuant to Section 11(d) of this Article II within two Business Days after receipt all Consents and revocations thereof received by such Consent Soliciting Shareholder or such Consent Soliciting Shareholder's proxy solicitor or other designated agent in connection with such Consent Soliciting Shareholder seeking to have the shareholders express written consent to corporate action without a meeting.

It shall be the duty of the Secretary or other officer of the Corporation who shall have charge of the stock ledger to prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of the shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each shareholder and the number of shares registered in his name. Such list shall be open to the examination of any shareholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period beginning two Business Days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing to the date of the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall be kept and produced at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and subject to the inspection of any shareholders who may be present. The original or duplicate ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or the books of the Corporation or to vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.

Section 8
Quorum; Postponement; Adjournments
(a) Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to that matter. Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, these By-Laws or in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter by the voting group shall constitute a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, other than for the purpose of objecting to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of the meeting unless a new Meeting Record Date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting.
(b) The Board of Directors acting by resolution may postpone and reschedule any previously scheduled meeting; provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting shall not be postponed beyond the 100th day following the Delivery Date. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum, (i) at any time, upon a resolution by shareholders if the votes cast in favor of such resolution by the holders of shares of each voting group entitled to vote on any matter theretofore properly brought before the meeting exceed the number of votes cast against such resolution by the holders of shares of each such voting group or (ii) at any time prior to the transaction of any business at such meeting, by the President, the Chairman of the Board or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that a Demand Special Meeting adjourned pursuant to clause (ii) must be reconvened on or before the 100th day following the Delivery Date. No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be given except as required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
. . Every shareholder of record who is entitled to vote shall at every meeting of the shareholders be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him on the record date; except, however, that shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the
Section 9
Voting
 
election of directors of such other corporation is held by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor counted for quorum purposes. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting the right of the Corporation to vote its own stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity. If a quorum exists, then action on a matter, other than the election of directors, by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law requires a greater number of affirmative votes. Each director shall be elected as provided in Section 2 of Article III. Unless demanded by a shareholder of the Corporation present in person or by proxy at any meeting of the shareholders and entitled to vote thereat or so directed by the chairman of the meeting or required by law, the vote thereat on any question need not be by written ballot. On a vote by written ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the shareholder voting, or in his name by his proxy, if there be such proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted by him and the number of votes to which each share is entitled.
. . At any meeting, a shareholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. A shareholder entitled to vote at any meeting, or to express consent or dissent in writing to any corporate action without a meeting, may authorize another Person to act for the shareholder by appointing the Person as a proxy. The means by which a shareholder or the shareholder's authorized officer, director, employee, agent or attorney-in-fact may authorize another Person to act for the shareholder by appointing the Person as proxy include:

(a) Appointment of a proxy in writing by signing or causing the shareholder's signature to be affixed to an appointment form by any reasonable means, including, without limitation, by facsimile signature.
(b) Appointment of a proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission of the appointment to the Person who will be appointed as proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent authorized to receive the transmission by the Person who will be appointed as proxy. Every electronic transmission shall contain, or be accompanied by, information that can be used to reasonably determine that the shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic transmission. Any Person charged with determining whether a shareholder transmitted or authorized the transmission of the electronic transmission shall specify the information upon which the determination is made.
An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of election or the officer or agent of the Corporation authorized to tabulate votes. Unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that the proxy is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest, a proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted, either by written notice filed with the Secretary or the secretary of the meeting or by oral notice given by the shareholder to the presiding officer during the meeting. The presence of a shareholder who has made an effective proxy appointment shall not of itself constitute a revocation. A proxy appointment is valid for eleven months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment. The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board and the President each shall have the power and authority to make rules as to the validity and sufficiency of proxies.

Section 11
Action without a Meeting
(a) Any action required to be taken at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting or any action which may be taken at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those shareholders who have not consented in writing.
(b) To be valid, each expression of consent to corporate action in writing (a "Consent") shall be in writing; shall set forth the specific corporate action to be taken (which corporate action or actions shall be limited to the action or actions set forth in the written request to set a Consent Record Date received by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II); shall be signed by one or more Persons who as of the Consent Record Date are shareholders of record (or their duly authorized proxies); shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder (or their duly authorized proxies); shall set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation's books, of each shareholder signing such Consent and the class and number of shares of the Corporation that are owned of record by each such shareholder; in the case of a Person who is not a shareholder of record, shall be accompanied by a proxy or proxies evidencing each such Person's appointment as a proxy for the applicable shareholder of record; and shall be sent to the inspectors of elections engaged by the Corporation pursuant to the following Section 11(d) in accordance with the provisions of the following Section 11(e). Without limiting the foregoing, no Consent shall be valid unless, within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, Consents representing the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate action are delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11; provided, however, that if the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting Consents) has requested a Preliminary Consent Report that is pending on such 70th day pursuant to the following Section 11(f), then such Consents shall be valid if Consents representing the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express such corporate action are delivered to the Corporation pursuant to this Section 11 at such time as such inspectors issue the Final Consent Report relating to the pending Preliminary Consent Report pursuant to the following Section 11(g) or Section 11(h). The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the President shall have the power and authority to make rules that are not inconsistent with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law as to the validity of Consents and revocations thereof.
 
(c) Consents may be revoked at any time prior to the earlier of (i) such time as the inspectors of elections issue a Final Consent Report pursuant to the following Section 11(g) or Section 11(h) or (ii) seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II by written notice delivered to (A) the Secretary, (B) any Consent Soliciting Shareholder, (C) to a proxy solicitor or other agent designated by the Corporation or any Consent Soliciting Shareholder and/or (D) the inspectors of elections engaged by the Corporation pursuant to the following Section 11(d).
(d) Within three Business Days after a Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, the Corporation shall (i) engage regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of Consents and revocations thereof and (ii) provide notice to each Consent Soliciting Shareholder of the identity of such inspectors and the manner in which such Consent Soliciting Shareholder may deliver Consents and revocations thereof to such inspectors pursuant to the following Section 11(e). Except as provided in Section 6(c)(ii) of this Article II, the cost of retaining inspectors of election shall be borne by the Corporation.
(e) The Corporation, the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and their respective proxy solicitors or other designated agents shall deliver Consents and revocations thereof to the inspectors within two Business Days after receipt. As soon as the inspectors receive Consents and/or revocations thereof, the inspectors shall review the Consents and revocations thereof and shall maintain a count of the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents. The inspectors shall keep such count confidential and shall not reveal the count to any Person; provided, however, that, as soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder, the inspectors shall issue a report (a "Consent Report") to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders stating: (i) the number of shares subject to valid Consents; (ii) the number of shares subject to valid revocations of Consents; (iii) the number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents; (iv) the number of shares subject to invalid Consents; (v) the number of shares subject to invalid revocations of Consents; (vi) whether, based on their count, the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents has been obtained to express the corporate action specified in the Consents; and (vii) the latest date the inspectors received Consents and revocations thereof that the inspectors reflected in such report (the "Report Date").
(f) As soon as practicable after a written request therefor by the Corporation or a Consent Soliciting Shareholder (whichever is soliciting Consents), notice of which request shall be given to the Corporation and any parties opposing the solicitation of Consents, if any, which request shall state that the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, have a good faith belief that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents has been received in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and these By-Laws, the inspectors shall issue and deliver to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a preliminary Consent Report (the "Preliminary Consent Report"); provided, however, that neither the Corporation nor the Consent Soliciting
 
Shareholders may request a Preliminary Consent Report after the 70th day after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II. Unless the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall agree to a shorter or longer period, the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall have two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report to review the Consents and revocations thereof and to advise the inspectors and the opposing parties in writing as to whether they intend to challenge the Preliminary Consent Report.
(g) If no written notice of an intention to challenge a Preliminary Consent Report is received within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report by the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and either (i) the date that is two Business Days after such receipt of such Preliminary Consent Report (the "Cut-Off Date") is more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II or (ii) the Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders their final Consent Report (a "Final Consent Report"), which shall contain the information included in the Preliminary Consent Report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of Consents and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent Report Report Date to the time of issuance of the Final Consent Report, if such Consents and revocations thereof are received within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, and a certification as to whether the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained. If the Cut-Off Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number or shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue a Consent Report to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a Preliminary Consent Report in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Section 11(f).
(h) If the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders issue written notice to the inspectors and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, as the case may be, of an intention to challenge a Preliminary Consent Report within two Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Consent Report by the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders, then a challenge session shall be scheduled by the inspectors as promptly as practicable, at which the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders shall have the right to object to the validity of Consents and revocations thereof. A transcript of the challenge session shall be recorded by a certified court reporter. Following completion of the challenge session, if either (i) the date on
 
which the challenge session is completed (the "Completion Date") is more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II or (ii) the Completion Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders a Final Consent Report, which shall contain the information included in the Preliminary Consent Report, plus all changes in the vote totals as a result of the challenge and, if such Consents and revocations thereof are received within seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II, Consents and revocations thereof received after the Preliminary Consent Report Report Date to the time of issuance of the Final Report, and a certification as to whether the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was obtained. If the Completion Date is not more than seventy days after the applicable Consent Record Date fixed pursuant to Section 6(c) of this Article II and the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, then the inspectors shall as promptly as practicable issue a Consent Report to the Corporation and the Consent Soliciting Shareholders and a certification that the requisite number of shares subject to valid and unrevoked Consents to express the corporate action specified in the Consents was not obtained, and the Corporation or the Consent Soliciting Shareholders (whichever is soliciting Consents) shall have the right to request again a Preliminary Consent Report in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Section 11(f).
(j) Simultaneously with the delivery of any Final Consent Report to the Corporation pursuant to the foregoing Section 11(g) or Section 11(4), the inspectors shall deliver all valid and unrevoked Consents to the Corporation, which shall constitute delivery of such Consents to the Corporation for purposes of Section 180.0704 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law and the Articles of Incorporation. A copy of any Final Consent Report shall be included in the book in which the proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded.
(k) As to any Consent, if, prior to the issuance of a Final Consent Report and delivery of Consents to the Corporation, all Consent Soliciting Shareholders notify the Corporation and the inspectors in writing that such Consent Soliciting Shareholders no longer desire to express consent to the corporate actions specified in the Consents, then the Consents shall be deemed abandoned, and the inspectors shall not issue a Final Consent Report or deliver such Consents to the Corporation.
. . If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation, acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of a shareholder. If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation, acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if any of the following apply:
Section 12

(a) The shareholder is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity.
(b) The name purports to be that of a personal representative, administrator, executor, guardian or conservator representing the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the Corporation is presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment.
(c) The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the Corporation is presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment.
(d) The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial owner, or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the Corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the Corporation of the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder is presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment.
(e) Two or more persons are the shareholders as co-tenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the co-owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all co-owners.
The Corporation may reject a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if the Secretary or other officer or agent of the Corporation who is authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder.
. . The Chairman of the Board or, in his or her absence, the President or, in the President's absence, a Vice President designated by the Board of Directors, shall call any Annual Meeting, Special Meeting or Demand Special Meeting to order and shall act as chairman of the meeting, and the Secretary shall act as secretary of all meetings of the shareholders, but, in the absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any other person to act as secretary of the meeting.

Section 1
Powers
. .
Section 2
Election and Term
(a) The Board of Directors shall be elected for terms as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation. Acceptance of the office of Director may be expressed orally or in writing, and attendance at a meeting shall constitute such acceptance.
(b) Except as provided in this Section 2, each Director shall be elected by the majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director's election at any meeting of shareholders for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present and the election is not a Contested Election. For purposes of this Section 2, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a Director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "withheld" with respect to that Director's election. Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast with respect to that Director's election. If at the close of the notice periods set forth in Section 5 of Article II or upon the Corporation's receipt of demands sufficient to require the calling of a Demand Special Meeting under Section 3(c) of Article II, the Chairman of the Board determines that the number of persons properly nominated to serve as Directors of the Corporation exceeds the number of Directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), each Director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast with respect to that Director's election at the meeting at which a quorum is present regardless of whether a Contested Election shall continue to exist as of the date of such meeting.
(c) In an election of Directors that is not a Contested Election, any nominee who was an incumbent Director whose term would otherwise have expired at the time of the election if a successor had been elected who receives a number of votes cast "for" his or her election less than the number of votes cast "withheld" with respect to his or her election (a "Majority Against Vote") will promptly tender his or her resignation to the
 
Chairman of the Board following certification of the shareholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors will promptly consider the resignation submitted by such director, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept the tendered resignation or to reject it. In considering whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, including, without limitation, the stated reasons why shareholders "withheld" votes for election from such Director, the length of service and qualifications of the Director whose resignation has been tendered and the Director's contributions to the Corporation. The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the meeting of shareholders at which the election occurred. In considering the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board of Directors will consider the factors considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and such additional information and factors the Board of Directors believes to be relevant. Following the Board of Directors' decision, the Corporation will promptly publicly disclose in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the Board of Directors' decision whether to accept the resignation as tendered, including a full explanation of the process by which the decision was reached and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation. Any Director who tenders a resignation pursuant to this provision will not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board of Directors consideration regarding whether or not to accept the tendered resignation. If a majority of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received Majority Against Votes at the same election, then the independent Directors who are on the Board of Directors who did not receive Majority Against Votes or who were not standing for election will appoint a committee of the Board of Directors among themselves for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations and will recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject them. This committee of the Board of Directors may, but need not, consist of all of the independent Directors who did not receive Majority Against Votes or who were not standing for election.
(d) If a Director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 2, or if a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent Director whose term would otherwise have expired at the time of the election if a successor had been elected, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 of Article III of these By-Laws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of Article III of these By-Laws.
. . The number of Directors shall be such number as shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors but shall not be less than three nor more than eleven.
Section 3
Number
 
. . Each Director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders in the year in which such Director's term expires and until his successor shall have been elected, or until his prior death, resignation or removal for cause only. A Director may be removed from office for cause only by the shareholders at an annual meeting or a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose if the number of votes cast to remove such Director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove such Director, and any vacancy so created may be filled by the shareholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to filling such vacancy. Directors need not be residents of the State of Wisconsin or shareholders of the Corporation.
Section 4

In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given. At all meetings of Directors, a quorum being present, all matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the majority of the Directors present, except as otherwise required by law. The Board of Directors may hold its meetings at such place or places within or without the State of Wisconsin as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or as shall be specified in the respective notices, or waivers of notice, thereof.

Each such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting and, as may be required, the purposes thereof. Notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given to any Director if he shall sign a written waiver thereof either before or after the time stated therein for such meeting, or if he shall be present at the meeting. Unless limited by law, the Articles of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the terms of the notice thereof, any and all business may be transacted at any meeting without the notice thereof having specifically identified the matters to be acted upon.
