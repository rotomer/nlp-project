Exhibit 99.1 ------------ [LETTERHEAD OF Fifth Third Bank] News Release CONTACT: Stacie Haas (media) FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 513/579-5113 January 31, 2003 Bradley S. Adams (analysts) 513/534-0983 FIFTH THIRD BANCORP ISSUES CLARIFYING STATEMENT REGARDING REGULATORY MATTERS Referring to statements made at the recent Salomon Smith Barney conference by Fifth Third Bancorp President & CEO George A. Schaefer, Jr., recent articles in the press have reported on Fifth Third Bancorp's outlook regarding current regulatory matters. In order to avoid confusion that may be associated with those reports Fifth Third believes it is important to issue a clarifying statement regarding the matter. As noted in Fifth Third's press release reporting fourth quarter earnings issued on January 15, 2003, Fifth Third continues to cooperate with the regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the State of Ohio, Division of Financial Institutions, in their ongoing examination of the Company. As previously stated, based on preliminary discussions with the regulators, Fifth Third believes some form of regulatory action will be taken, but it is unable to predict what that action may be. Based on these preliminary discussions with the Federal Reserve and the State of Ohio, Fifth Third believes that the resulting agreement with the supervisory agencies will be formal and contain commitments to third-party reviews of certain functions as previously discussed. Fifth Third does, however, remain optimistic that the steps taken in conjunction with the ongoing examination will make the organization stronger through the development of new and expanded risk management, audit and infrastructure processes. The full discussion and text of Fifth Third's presentation can be accessed through Fifth Third's website at www.53.com.
