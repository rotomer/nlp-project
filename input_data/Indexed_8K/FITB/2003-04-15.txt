Exhibit 99.1 [LOGO] Fifth Third Bancorp News Release CONTACT: Neal E. Arnold, CFO (Analysts) FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (513) 579-4356 April 15, 2003 Bradley S. Adams, IR (Analysts) (513) 534-0983 Roberta R. Jennings (Media) (513) 579-4153 FIFTH THIRD BANCORP REPORTS NINE PERCENT INCREASE IN FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS Fifth Third Bancorp's 2003 first quarter earnings per diluted share were $.72, an increase of nine percent over $.66 per share for the same period in 2002. First quarter net income totaled $418,819,000, a seven percent increase over first quarter 2002's net income of $389,969,000. First quarter return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 2.05 percent and 19.6 percent, respectively, compared to 2.23 percent and 20.1 percent in 2002's first quarter. Fifth Third continues to maintain its commitment to a strong, flexible balance sheet evidenced by the first quarter 2003 capital ratio of 10.42 percent. "I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work in producing another quarter of solid growth," stated George A. Schaefer, Jr., President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "Financial results were driven by solid revenue and loan growth despite the challenges of a difficult external environment. The lack of a meaningful rebound in business activity, the level of interest rates and the corresponding impact on investment opportunities are continuing to pose significant challenges to the financial services industry. The financial strength of our balance sheet, market share upside and considerable momentum in our individual markets serve to position Fifth Third to continue to deliver positive results in this environment. Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains upbeat as our sales force and affiliate management teams continue to focus on winning customer relationships and cross-selling additional products and services." "As previously disclosed, Fifth Third signed a Written Agreement during the quarter with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Ohio Department of Commerce to address and strengthen risk management processes and internal controls. We are continuing to work very hard and are making excellent progress in these areas. I believe that these efforts, when completed, will result in Fifth Third emerging as an even stronger company." Strong Loan and Deposit Growth, Balance Sheet Trends Loan and lease demand continued to exhibit strong growth with average loans and leases increasing 13 percent on an annualized sequential basis and 15 percent over the same quarter last year. Better than expected middle-market and small business commercial loan originations and continued strength in direct installment lending highlight the first quarter balance sheet growth. Direct installment loan originations remained strong and totaled $1.7 billion in the first quarter, compared to $1.7 billion last quarter and $1.5 billion in the first quarter last year. Installment loan balances
increased by 19 percent over the first quarter of last year and eight percent on an annualized sequential basis. Commercial period-end loan and lease balances increased by over $770 million from last quarter levels, or 13 percent on an annualized basis, and 13 percent over the same quarter last year on the strength of new customer additions. Fifth Third is continuing to devote significant sales and marketing focus on driving high quality originations. Sales momentum in most of our markets and the ability to attract and retain customer relationships resulted in another strong quarter of deposit growth for Fifth Third. Average interest checking balances increased 29 percent and average demand deposit balances grew 13 percent compared to last year's first quarter with average transaction account balances as a whole increasing 23 percent over the same quarter last year. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2002, period-end transaction account balances increased by 11 percent on an annualized basis highlighted by 15 percent annualized growth in demand deposits and 18 percent annualized growth in interest checking balances. Net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased nine percent over the same quarter last year despite a 36 basis point (bp) decrease in the net interest margin due to strong earning asset growth. Sequentially, net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased by four percent on an annualized basis despite a six bp decline in the net interest margin due to strong earning asset growth. Fifth Third increased the taxable securities portfolio and wholesale funding by seven percent and 26 percent on an average basis, respectively, from last quarter in an effort to decrease asset sensitivity and remain within prescribed interest rate risk policy limits given the largely variable and short-term nature of earning assets on the balance sheet. The net interest margin has contracted in recent periods due to the absolute level of interest rates and the impact of new origination volumes at lower market rates of interest. Fifth Third expects margin and net interest income trends in coming periods will be dependent upon the magnitude of loan demand, the overall level of business activity in the Bank's Midwestern footprint and the speed of any interest rate changes. Fifth Third repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of its common stock for a total of approximately $32 million in the first quarter of 2003. As of March 31, 2003, the remaining authority under a previously existing plan as well as a new plan authorized by the Board of Directors in March 2003 was approximately 25 million shares. Other Operating Income Advances 18 Percent Recent strong business line revenue growth trends continued in the first quarter with total other operating income up 18 percent over the same quarter last year. Fifth Third Processing Solutions, our Electronic Payment Processing subsidiary, delivered a 20 percent increase in revenues over the first quarter of last year. Comparisons to prior periods are impacted by the significant seasonal increases in transaction volumes typically seen in the fourth quarter and a slowdown in transaction volume growth rates on the existing customer base reflective of current economic conditions compared to last year's first quarter. Fifth Third Processing Solutions continues to realize strong sales momentum from the addition of new customer relationships in both its Merchant Services and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) businesses. Successful sales of retail and commercial deposit accounts and corporate treasury management products fueled increases in deposit service revenues of 16 percent over the same quarter last year. The first quarter increase was highlighted by a 10 percent increase in retail deposit based revenues and a 24 percent increase in commercial deposit 2
based revenues over the same quarter last year on the strength of improved cross-sell, new customer relationships and the benefit of a lower interest rate environment. Mortgage net service revenue totaled $76.8 million in the first quarter compared to $66.7 million last quarter and $101.7 million in 2002's first quarter. Inclusive of net realized securities gains/losses resulting from sales from a portfolio established to hedge against volatility related to the value of mortgage servicing rights, mortgage net service revenue in the first quarter totaled $77.9 million compared to $67.5 million last quarter and $65.0 million in 2002's first quarter. Mortgage origination totaled $4.3 billion in the first quarter versus $4.3 billion last quarter and $2.5 billion in the first quarter of last year. Fifth Third does not expect the current low-rate environment to continue in the long-term at which time the contribution of mortgage banking to total revenues will decline as originations slow later in 2003. First quarter mortgage net service revenue was comprised of $120.3 million in total mortgage banking fees, plus $8.6 million resulting from the servicing asset and corresponding gain recognized from a $355 million residential mortgage loan sale completed in late March, plus $1.0 million of gains on the sale of balance sheet securities from a portfolio established to hedge against volatility related to the value of mortgage servicing rights, plus $13.7 million of gains and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments and less $65.7 million in net valuation adjustments and amortization on mortgage servicing rights. The sale of balance sheet securities, mark-to-market adjustments and settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments, corresponding valuation adjustments, and the gain related to the loan sale resulted from movements in interest rates and the anticipated level of prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, is $248.6 million at March 31, 2003, compared to $263.5 million last quarter and $492.3 million a year ago. Investment Advisory revenues declined two percent from the same quarter last year and increased 27 percent on an annualized basis from last quarter despite the challenges of a difficult market. Declines in market sensitive service income were mitigated by strong growth in retail brokerage, private banking and annuity and mutual fund sales through the retail banking center network. Fifth Third continues to focus its sales efforts on integrating services across business lines and working closely with retail and commercial team members to take advantage of a diverse and expanding customer base. Fifth Third Investment Advisors, among the largest money managers in the Midwest, has $29 billion in assets under management and $189 billion in assets under care. Other service charges and fees totaled $158.4 million in the first quarter, a 21 percent increase over the first quarter last year and a three percent decline from last quarter. Exclusive of the benefit of a divestiture related gain in the fourth quarter of 2002 discussed below, first quarter growth is largely due to increases across nearly all categories with a slight decrease in consumer loan fees. Compared to the first quarter of last year, commercial banking revenues increased 29 percent, institutional fixed income trading and sales revenues increased 44 percent and cardholder fees increased 10 percent. Other service charges and fees comparisons to prior periods are impacted by a pre-tax gain of approximately $26 million realized from the fourth quarter 2002 sale of the property and casualty insurance agency product line operations representing approximately $26 million in revenue on a full year 2002 basis. 3
Credit Quality Credit quality metrics and trends were relatively mixed in the first quarter with the amount of nonperforming assets and net charge-offs increasing from last quarter and delinquent loans and leases improving. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs remains a small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. Nonperforming assets (NPAs) stand at 65 bp of total loans and leases and other real estate owned at March 31, 2003, compared to the 59 bp posted last quarter with the increase largely attributable to three commercial leases totaling approximately $20 million. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $64.7 million, compared to $49.5 million last quarter and $50.4 million in the first quarter of 2002. The first quarter provision for loan and lease losses totaled $84.8 million, compared to $72.1 million last quarter and $54.9 million in the same quarter last year, resulting in a $20.2 million increase in the credit loss reserve, remaining steady overall at 1.49 percent of total loans and leases outstanding. As a percentage of average loans and leases, first quarter net charge-offs were 56 bp, compared to 49 bp in 2002's first quarter and 43 bp last quarter. Operating Expenses First quarter operating expenses increased 14 percent over the same period last year and eight percent on an annualized basis from last quarter. Comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by implications of growth in all of our markets and increases in spending related to the expansion and improvement of our sales force, growth of the retail banking platform, continuing investment in support personnel, technology and infrastructure to support recent and future growth, increasing insurance and other employee benefit expenses and expenses related to certain third party consultant reviews. Third party consultant reviews of reconciliation activities and process evaluations associated with the March 26, 2003 Written Agreement entered into by Fifth Third Bancorp, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Financial Institutions resulted in approximately $9.5 million in incremental expenses in the first quarter. Fifth Third's first quarter efficiency ratio stands at 44.5 percent compared to 44.1 percent last quarter and 44.1 percent in the first quarter of last year.
