The Securities will be issued under the indenture referenced in Schedule I hereto (the "Indenture"), between Fifth Third and the trustee named in Schedule I (the "Trustee"). 1. Representations and Warranties. Fifth Third represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that: (a) The registration statement (File No. 333-86360) on Form S-3 (the "registration statement"), including a prospectus which, as supplemented, shall be used in connection with the sale of the Securities, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), in the form heretofore delivered to the Representatives. The registration statement, as it may have been amended prior to the date of this Agreement, has become effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). (The registration statement, as amended to the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement"; such prospectus (which shall be in the form in which it has been most recently filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission on or before the date of this Agreement, as the same is proposed to be added to or changed), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act and used in connection with the sale of the Securities, is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus"; and such prospectus supplement is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus Supplement". Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on or before the date of this
Agreement, and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act deemed to be incorporated therein by reference after the date of this Agreement.) (b) The Registration Statement, at the time it became effective, and any amendments thereof filed prior to the date hereof, as of their respective effective dates, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto, as of their respective effective or issue dates, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and no such document, as of such respective dates and, in the case of the Prospectus and any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, as of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), included or will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, provided that Fifth Third makes no representations or warranties as to (i) the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to Fifth Third by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for use in connection with the preparation of the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto. (c) Each of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries has been duly organized, is validly existing in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all power and authority (corporate and other) necessary to own or hold its material properties and to conduct its business substantially in the manner in which it presently conducts such business, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification, except for failures to be so qualified or be in good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (d) Fifth Third is duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). Fifth Third and each of its subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all laws administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and any other federal or state bank regulatory authorities (together with the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, the "Bank Regulatory Authorities") with jurisdiction over Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, except for failures to be so in compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 2
(e) The deposit accounts of each of the bank subsidiaries of Fifth Third are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and no proceedings for the termination or revocation of such insurance are pending or, to the knowledge of Fifth Third, threatened. (f) The Securities have been duly authorized, and, when issued, delivered and paid for pursuant to this Agreement, will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of Fifth Third entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture; the Indenture has been duly authorized and, at the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3 hereof), the Indenture will be duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and will constitute a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the Securities and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus. (g) Fifth Third has all corporate power and authority necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder; the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities by Fifth Third and compliance with the provisions hereof and thereof by Fifth Third will not constitute a breach of or default under, the Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations of Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries, or any material agreement, indenture or other instrument to which Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or, to the best of Fifth Third's knowledge, any law, order, rule, regulation or decree of any court, governmental agency or authority located in the United States having jurisdiction over Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries or any property of Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries, which breach or default would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or on the ability of Fifth Third to perform its obligations hereunder or its obligations under the Indenture or the Securities; and, no consent, authorization or order of, or filing or registration with, any court or governmental agency or authority is required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities by Fifth Third except such as have been made or obtained or will be made or obtained on or before the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3) and except such as may be required under applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws. (h) Neither Fifth Third nor any of its subsidiaries has sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any material loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, except for losses or interferences that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there has not been any material change in the capital stock or long-term debt of Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development that is reasonably likely to result in a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity 3
or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus. (i) Fifth Third has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus, and all of the issued shares of capital stock of Fifth Third have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. (j) Neither Fifth Third nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation or default of (i) any of its Articles of Incorporation, Code of Regulations, By-laws or other constitutive documents, (ii) the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over Fifth Third, its subsidiaries or any of its and its subsidiaries properties, as applicable, except, in the case of clause (ii), for violations or defaults that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (k) Fifth Third has filed all foreign, federal, state and local tax returns that are required to be filed or has requested extensions thereof and has paid all taxes required to be paid by it and any other assessment, fine or penalty levied against it, to the extent that any of the foregoing is due and payable, except for any such assessment, fine or penalty that is currently being contested in good faith. (l) Fifth Third is not subject to any order of the Federal Reserve Board which, as of the date hereof, prohibits the payment of dividends by any of its subsidiaries. (m) Other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the ability of Fifth Third to perform its obligations hereunder or its obligations under the Indenture or the Securities; and, to the best of Fifth Third's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others. (n) Fifth Third is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities, will not be an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). (o) Deloitte & Touche LLP, who have certified certain financial statements of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, are independent public accountants as required by the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. (p) Fifth Third has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act) that (A) are designed to ensure that material information relating to Fifth Third, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is 4
made known to Fifth Third's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the filings made by Fifth Third with the Commission which it may make under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are being prepared, (B) have been evaluated for effectiveness as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing of Fifth Third's most recent Annual Report filed with the Commission and (C) are effective to perform the functions for which they were established. The accountants and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have been advised of (x) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Fifth Third's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a role in the Fifth Third's internal controls; any material weaknesses in internal controls have been identified for the accountants; and since the date of the most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures, there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 2. Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, Fifth Third agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from Fifth Third, at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto, the principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule II hereto. 3. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment for the Securities shall be made at the office, on the date and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and Fifth Third (such date and time of delivery of and payment for the Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of Fifth Third in the manner and type of funds specified in Schedule I. Certificates for the Securities shall be registered in such names and in such denominations as the Representatives may request not less than one full business day in advance of the Closing Date. Fifth Third agrees to have the Securities available for inspection, checking and packaging in New York, New York, on the business day prior to the Closing Date. 4. Offering by Underwriters. It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale as set forth in the Prospectus. 5. Agreements. Fifth Third agrees with the several Underwriters that: (a) Fifth Third will cause the Prospectus to be filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act and will promptly advise the Representatives when the Prospectus has been so filed or transmitted for filing, and, prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities to which such Prospectus relates, also will promptly advise the Representatives (i) when any amendment to the Registration Statement has become effective or any further supplement to the Prospectus has been so filed or transmitted for filing, (ii) of any 5
request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose, and (iv) of the receipt by Fifth Third of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. Fifth Third will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as reasonably possible the withdrawal thereof. For so long as a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, Fifth Third will not file or transmit for filing any amendment to the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus which relates to the Securities unless Fifth Third has furnished you or counsel for the Underwriters a copy for your review prior to filing or transmission for filing. (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in connection with the sale of the Securities to comply with the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, promptly after becoming aware thereof, Fifth Third will notify the Representatives or counsel for the Underwriters and, upon their or its reasonable request, prepare and file or transmit for filing with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, and prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance. (c) Fifth Third will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the end of the 12-month period beginning at the end of the fiscal quarter of Fifth Third during which the filing, or transmission for filing, of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act occurs (except not later than 90 days after the end of such period if such quarter is the last fiscal quarter), an earnings statement (which need not be audited) of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, covering such 12-month period, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act. (d) Fifth Third will use its best efforts to furnish in New York City to each of the Underwriters prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the New York business day next succeeding the date of this Agreement and from time to time, as many copies of the Prospectus, each related preliminary prospectus supplement and all amendments of and supplements to such documents as may be reasonably requested. (e) Fifth Third will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, and will pay the expenses of printing and filing all documents relating to the offering and mailing and delivering such to Underwriters and dealers, any filing fee incident to any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Securities, all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws (including the fees and disbursements of counsel to 6
the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and the preparation of the Blue Sky and legal investment surveys), any taxes payable in connection with the sale and delivery of the Securities by Fifth Third to the Underwriters, and any fees charged for rating the Securities. (f) Fifth Third will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities; provided that Fifth Third shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (g) During the period beginning from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the Closing Date or such longer period as may be agreed to by Fifth Third and set forth in Schedule I hereto relating to the Securities, Fifth Third will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any of its debt securities which mature more than one year after the Closing Date and which are substantially similar to the Securities without the prior written consent of the Representatives. (h) Fifth Third will file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by Fifth Third with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Securities. 6. Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of Fifth Third contained herein as of the date hereof and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of Fifth Third made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by Fifth Third of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions: (a) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted and be pending or have been threatened as of the Closing Date; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with. (b) Fifth Third shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate, dated the Closing Date, of Fifth Third, signed by the principal financial or accounting officer of Fifth Third, to the effect that, to the best of his knowledge after reasonable investigation: (i) The representations and warranties of Fifth Third in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and Fifth Third has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted and are pending or have been threatened as of such date; 7
(iii) Since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects relating thereto of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries consolidated, except as set forth in or contemplated by the Prospectus; and (iv) Since the date of this Agreement, (A) no downgrading has occurred in the rating accorded Fifth Third's unsecured debt securities or preferred stock as described in Section 6(i)(1) and (B) no announcement has been made with respect to any rating accorded Fifth Third's unsecured debt securities or preferred stock as described in Section 6(i)(2). (c) Fifth Third shall have furnished to the Underwriters the opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Paul L. Reynolds, Esq., Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Fifth Third, to the effect that: (i) Each of Fifth Third and Fifth Third Bank has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio, with corporate power and authority under such laws to own its material properties and to conduct its business substantially as described in the Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification, except for failures to be so qualified or be in good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and Fifth Third is duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. (ii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Fifth Third; the Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered; and the Indenture and the Securities conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented. (iii) Fifth Third has all corporate power and authority necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities, and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder; this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Fifth Third; the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture, and the Securities by Fifth Third and compliance with the provisions hereof and thereof by Fifth Third will not constitute a breach of or default under, the Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations of Fifth Third, or any material agreement, indenture or other instrument known to such counsel to which Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, any law, order, rule, regulation or decree of any court, governmental agency or authority located in the United States having jurisdiction over Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries or any property of Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries, which breach or default would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or on the ability of Fifth Third to perform its obligations hereunder or its obligations under the Indenture or the Securities; and no consent, authorization or order of, or filing or registration with, any 8
court or governmental agency is required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture or the Securities by Fifth Third except such as may be required under applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws or as have been duly made or obtained. (iv) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act, and, to the best of the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened under the Act, and each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, any amendments thereof filed prior to the date of this Agreement, as of their respective effective dates, and the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto, as of their respective effective or issue dates, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in any part of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. (v) The statements included in the Prospectus under the heading "Regulatory Considerations" and the statements incorporated by reference in the Prospectus from Fifth Third's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Regulation and Supervision," in each case, insofar as such statements summarize legal matters, agreements, documents or proceedings discussed therein, are accurate and fair summaries of such legal matters, agreements, documents or proceedings. In rendering such opinion or opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of the State of New York, upon the opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, subject to all the limitations and qualifications set forth in such opinion, and (B) as to certain other matters, on certificates of responsible officers of Fifth Third, public officials and others deemed by such counsel to be responsible. (vi) Such counsel shall confirm that, to the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, stockholders' equity or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the ability of Fifth Third to perform its obligations hereunder or its obligations under the Indenture or the Securities; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others. In addition, such counsel shall confirm that such counsel has no reason to believe that any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of the date of 9
the Prospectus Supplement, or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, as of their respective effective or issue dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that, as of the Closing Date, either the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by Fifth Third prior to the Closing Date contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in any part of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. (d) Fifth Third shall have furnished to the Underwriters the opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, to the effect that: (i) Each of Fifth Third and Fifth Third Bank has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio. (ii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; the Securities have been duly authenticated, issued and delivered; and the Indenture and the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of Fifth Third enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. (iii) Each part of the Registration Statement, at the time such part became effective, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in any part of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. In rendering such opinion or opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters which relate to the Trustee, upon the certificate or certificates of such Trustee, (B) as to matters involving the application of laws of the State of Ohio, upon the opinion of Paul L. Reynolds, Esq., subject to all the limitations and qualifications set forth in such opinion, and (C) as to certain other matters, on certificates of responsible officers of Fifth Third, public officials and others deemed by such counsel to be responsible. In addition, such counsel shall state that they have participated in discussions with representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, representatives of the Underwriters and counsel for the Underwriters at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed, and, although such counsel have not independently verified and assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement and 10
the Prospectus, nothing that came to such counsel's attention in the course of such procedures has caused such counsel to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities, any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that, as of the Closing Date, either the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by Fifth Third prior to the Closing Date contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in any part of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. (e) The Representatives shall have received from Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to such matters as the Representatives may reasonably require. As to matters governed by Ohio law, Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP may rely upon the opinion of Paul L. Reynolds, Esq., Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Fifth Third. (f) Deloitte & Touche LLP, as independent accountants of Fifth Third, shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated as of the date hereof, to the effect set forth in Schedule III hereto. On the Closing Date, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, to the effect that they reaffirm the statements made in the letter furnished pursuant to the prior sentence. (g) (i) (A) Neither Fifth Third nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus prior to the date of this Agreement any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus prior to the date of this Agreement, and (B) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus prior to the date of this Agreement there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of Fifth Third or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of Fifth Third and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus prior to the date of the this Agreement, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (A) or (B), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. 11
(h) Fifth Third shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as they may reasonably request prior to the Closing Date. (i) Subsequent to the date of this Agreement, (1) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded Fifth Third's unsecured debt securities or preferred stock by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group or by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and (2) neither such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of Fifth Third's unsecured debt securities or preferred stock. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to Fifth Third in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing. 7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) Fifth Third agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement or in any amendment thereof filed prior to the date hereof, or in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or in any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that (i) Fifth Third will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Fifth Third by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the Prospectus or any supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement or of the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities which are the subject thereof if such person was not sent or given a copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented), excluding documents incorporated therein by reference, at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or 12
supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which Fifth Third may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Fifth Third, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls Fifth Third within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from Fifth Third to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information furnished to Fifth Third by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the Prospectus or any supplement thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or (b) of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under Section 7(a) or (b). In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided that, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under Section 7(a) or (b) for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party (other than reasonable costs of investigation) in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate national counsel, approved by the Representatives, representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or 13
judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by Fifth Third on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of Fifth Third on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by Fifth Third on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by Fifth Third bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by Fifth Third on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Fifth Third and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to the Securities and not joint. 14
8. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to Fifth Third prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time there shall have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System ("NASDAQ"); (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in Fifth Third's securities on NASDAQ; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal, New York or Ohio state authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; or (iv) any change in the financial markets in the United States or the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or any other national or international calamity or crisis, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. 9. Substituted Underwriters. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate number of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Underwriters may agree, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the Closing Date; provided that in no event shall the number of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 2 above be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate number of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and Fifth Third for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or Fifth Third. In such case either the Underwriters or Fifth Third shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this Section 9 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. 10. Certain Liabilities Upon Termination. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, Fifth Third shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 5(e) and 7 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of Fifth Third as provided herein, Fifth Third will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all actual out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities not so delivered, but Fifth Third 15
shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter in respect of the Securities not so delivered except as provided in Sections 5(e) and 7 hereof. 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of Fifth Third or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or Fifth Third or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 5(e), 7, 9, 12, 13 and 14 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 12. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto (including any Underwriter or Underwriters added pursuant to Section 9 hereof) and their respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. 13. APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 14. Counterparts; Notices. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. All notices hereunder shall be in writing or by telegram if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the address of the Representatives as set forth in Schedule I hereto; and if to Fifth Third shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail to the address of Fifth Third set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 7 (c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to Fifth Third by the Representatives upon request. 15. Action by Underwriters. Any action under this Agreement taken by the Underwriters jointly or by the firm signing below on behalf of you as the Representatives will be binding upon all the Underwriters. 16

The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106. The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 512, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106. With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date -9-
shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date. Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount. SECTION 105. Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.

SECTION 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver. Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. -10-
SECTION 107. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act which is required under such Act to be a part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.

In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. SECTION 111. Benefits of Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture. SECTION 112. Governing Law. This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York. SECTION 113. Legal Holidays. In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities (other than a provision of any Security which specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section)) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity. -11-

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

In the absence of any such specified denomination with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. -20-
SECTION 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Vice Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating, (1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and (3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. -21-
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Section 304. Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor. Section 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange. The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. -22-
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer. If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part. The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities: (1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security or (C) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301. -23-
(3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct. (4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 304, 306, 906 or 1107 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof. Section 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. Section 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved. Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one -24-
or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. Section 308. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) any interest on such Security and for -25-
all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Section 309. Cancellation. All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly canceled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a Company Order. Section 310. Computation of Interest. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Section 311. CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may use CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities. Any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers. ARTICLE FOUR SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE Section 401. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture. This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when -26-
(1) either (A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose money in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive. Section 402. Application of Trust Money. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee. -27-
ARTICLE FIVE REMEDIES Section 501. Events of Default. "Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be occasioned by the provisions of Article Fourteen or be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property (other than a conservator or other similar official in respect of a Bank), or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or (2) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property (other than a conservator or other similar official in respect of a Bank), or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or (3) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series. Section 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to -28-
the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series, (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee. The Company covenants that if (1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable (without acceleration) on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the -29-
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Security or Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated. "Default", wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or governmental body); (A) an Event of Default with respect to any Securities of that series; or (B) the events referred to in subsections 503(1) through (2) above with respect to any Securities of that series; or (C) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 30 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or (D) any other Default provided with respect to Securities of that series. If a Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed, at the sole expense of the Company, to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. Section 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any -30-
custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607. No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee. Section 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. Section 506. Application of Money Collected. Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607; and Second: Subject to Article Fourteen, to the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest, respectively. Section 507. Limitation on Suits. No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Default with respect to the Securities of that series; -31-
(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing itself of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders. SECTION 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. SECTION 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy -32-
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. SECTION 512. Control by Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction. SECTION 513. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default: (1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 514. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess costs against any such party litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust Indenture Act; provided that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to -33-
authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company. SECTION 515. Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. ARTICLE SIX The Trustee SECTION 601. Certain Duties and Responsibilities. The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. SECTION 602. Notice of Defaults. If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, and such default is known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such default as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act; provided, however, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Clause (C) of the definition of "Default" set forth in Section 503 with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series. SECTION 603. Certain Rights of Trustee. Subject to the provisions of Section 601: (1) the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; -34-
(2) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order, and any resolution of the Board of Directors shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution; (3) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate; (4) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (5) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; (6) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; and (7) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder. (8) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith that it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers. SECTION 604. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities. The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof. SECTION 605. May Hold Securities. The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, may otherwise deal with the Company -35-
with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent. SECTION 606. Money Held in Trust. Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by-law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company. SECTION 607. Compensation and Reimbursement. The Company agrees (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and (3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability (including without limitation any liability incurred under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, which indemnification shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or the resignation or removal of the Trustee. To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section 607, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except for money or property held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of particular Securities. The Trustee shall not institute any proceeding seeking the enforcement of such lien unless the Securities have been declared due and payable pursuant to Article Five hereof following any Event of Default, such acceleration of Maturity and its consequences have not been rescinded and annulled, and moneys collected by the Trustee are being applied in accordance with Article Five hereof. SECTION 608. Conflicting Interests. If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by such Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities of more than one series. -36-
SECTION 609. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility. There shall at all times be one (and only one) Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of each series, which may be Trustee hereunder for Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such, and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. SECTION 610. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611. The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company. If at any time: (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (A) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (B) subject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly -37-
situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office. SECTION 611. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor -38-
Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be. No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. SECTION 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. SECTION 613. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). -39-
SECTION 614. Appointment of Authenticating Agent. The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section. Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency.

at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. SECTION 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust. If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series. The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability -47-
of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

SECTION 1005. Existence. Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and the rights (charter and statutory) and franchises of the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders. SECTION 1006. Maintenance of Properties. The Company will cause all properties used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of such properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders. SECTION 1007. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims. The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2) all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by-law become a lien upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any -48-
such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. SECTION 1008. Waiver of Certain Covenants. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series, the Company may, with respect to the Securities of any series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in any covenant provided pursuant to Section 301(18), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such series if before the time for such compliance the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect. ARTICLE ELEVEN REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES SECTION 1101. Applicability of Article.

SECTION 1102. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee. The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities.

In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction. SECTION 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed. If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee and which may provide for the -49-
selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series, provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. SECTION 1104. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers, if any) and shall state: (1) the Redemption Date, (2) the Redemption Price, (3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed, (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, (5) the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, and -50-
(6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case. Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable. SECTION 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date. SECTION 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, instalments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security. SECTION 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part. Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. -51-
ARTICLE TWELVE SINKING FUNDS SECTION 1201. Applicability of Article. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any Securities is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of such Securities is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment".

The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price, as specified in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. SECTION 1203. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund. Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 1202 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 45 days prior to each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107. -52-

Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Company shall be released from its obligations under Sections 1006 through 1007, inclusive, and any covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(18), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Section 501(3) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, and (3) the occurrence of any event specified in Clause (C) of the definition of "Default" set forth in Section 503 (with respect to any of Sections 1006 through 1008, inclusive, and any such covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(18), 901(2) or 901(7)) shall be deemed not to be or result in a Default and (4) the provisions of Article Fourteen shall cease to be effective, in each case with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such -53-
Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified, in the case of Clause (C) of the definition of "Default" set forth in Section 503) or Article Fourteen, whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or Article or by reason of any reference in any such Section or Article to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby. SECTION 1304. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 1302 or Section 1303 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be: (1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee which satisfies the requirements contemplated by Section 609 and agrees to comply with the provisions of this Article applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefits of the Holders of such Securities, (A) in the case of Securities denominated in a foreign currency, money in such foreign currency or Foreign Government Obligations of the foreign government or governments issuing such foreign currency which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, such foreign currency in an amount, or (B) in the case of Securities denominated in U.S. dollars, U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, U.S. dollars in an amount, or (C) a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations or Foreign Government Obligations (as applicable), in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or any such other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities on the respective Stated Maturities, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and such Securities. As used herein, "U.S. Government Obligation" means (x) any security which is (i) a direct obligation of the United States of America for the payment of which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America, which, in either case (i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) as custodian with respect to any U.S. Government Obligation which is specified in Clause (x) above and held by such bank for the account of the holder of such depositary receipt, or with respect to any specific payment of principal of or interest on any U.S. Government Obligation which is so specified and held, provided that (except as required by-law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depositary receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of principal or interest evidenced by such depositary receipt. As used herein, "Foreign Government Obligation" means any security denominated in a Foreign Currency which is (i) a direct obligation of a foreign government or governments for the payment of which the full faith and credit of such foreign government or governments is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person -54-

(2) In the event of an election to have Section 1302 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A)(x) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (y) since the date of this instrument, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case (x) or (y) to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, Defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit, Defeasance and discharge were not to occur and (B) if Securities of such series Securities are then listed on the New York Stock Exchange, to the effect that the Securities of such series will not be delisted as a result of such election. (3) In the event of an election to have Section 1303 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur. (4) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that neither such Securities nor any other Securities of the same series, if then listed on any securities exchange, will be delisted as a result of such deposit. (5) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 501(1) and (2), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after such 90th day). (6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such Act). (7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound. (8) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt from registration thereunder. -55-
(9) At the time of such deposit, (A) no default in the payment of any principal of or premium or interest on any Senior Indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing, (B) no event of default with respect to any Senior Debt shall have resulted in such Senior Indebtedness becoming, and continuing to be, due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable (unless payment of such Senior Indebtedness has been made or duly provided for), and (C) no other event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing permitting (after notice or lapse of time or both) the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of such holders) to declare such Senior Indebtedness due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable. (10) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been complied with. SECTION 1305. Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust; Miscellaneous Provisions. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money, U.S. Government Obligations and Foreign Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying trustee (solely for purposes of this Section and Section 1306, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred to collectively as the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1304 in respect of any Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but money so held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. Money, U.S. Government Obligations and Foreign Government Obligations so held in trust shall not be subject to the provisions of Article Fourteen. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations or Foreign Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities. Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations or Foreign Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1304 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities. SECTION 1306. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or -56-
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 1302 or 1303 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1305 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust. ARTICLE FOURTEEN SUBORDINATION OF SECURITIES SECTION 1401. Securities Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Security, by his acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article, the indebtedness represented by the Securities and the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on each and all of the Securities are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness and subject to the rights of Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations as set forth in this Article. SECTION 1402. Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc. In the event of (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or proceeding in connection therewith, relative to the Company or to its creditors, as such, or to its assets, or (b) any liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary and whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, or (c) any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company, then and in any such event the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive any payment on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Securities, and to that end the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive, for application to the payment thereof, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Securities, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the Securities in any such case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up or event. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the Trustee or the Holder of any Security shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Securities, before -57-
all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full or payment thereof provided for, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment or distribution, have been made known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment or distribution shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other Person making payment or distribution of assets of the Company for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness. For purposes of this Article only, the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment which are subordinated in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding to substantially the same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Securities are so subordinated as provided in this Article. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to another Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in Article Eight shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors or marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company for the purposes of this Section if the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer such properties and assets substantially as an entirety, as the case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions set forth in Article Eight. SECTION 1403. Prior Payment to Senior Indebtedness Upon Acceleration of Securities. In the event that any Securities are declared due and payable before their Stated Maturity, then and in such event the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive any payment (including any payment which may be payable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Securities) by the Company on account of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the satisfaction of any sinking fund payment in accordance with Article Twelve by delivering and crediting pursuant to Section 1202 Securities of such series which have been acquired (upon redemption or otherwise) prior to such declaration of acceleration. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any payment with respect to which Section 1402 would be applicable. -58-
SECTION 1404. No Payment When Senior Indebtedness in Default. (a) In the event and during the continuation of any default in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Indebtedness beyond any applicable grace period with respect thereto, or in the event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing permitting the holders of such Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of the holders thereof) to declare such Senior Indebtedness due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, unless and until such event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist and such acceleration shall have been rescinded or annulled, or (b) in the event any judicial proceeding shall be pending with respect to any such default in payment or event of default, then no payment (including any payment which may be payable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Securities) shall be made by the Company on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the satisfaction of any sinking fund payment in accordance with Article Twelve by delivering and crediting pursuant to Section 1202 Securities which have been acquired (upon redemption or otherwise) prior to such default in payment or event of default. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any payment with respect to which Section 1402 would be applicable. SECTION 1405. Payment Permitted in Certain Situations. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent the Company, at any time except during the pendency of any case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up, assignment for the benefit of creditors or other marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company referred to in Section 1402 or under the conditions described in Section 1403 or 1404, from making payments at any time of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities. SECTION 1406. Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness. Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated to the extent of the payments or distributions made to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of this Article (equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the Company which by its express terms is subordinated to indebtedness of the Company to substantially the same extent as the Securities are subordinated and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities shall be paid in full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the -59-
Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article, and no payments over pursuant to the provisions of this Article to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee, shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness. SECTION 1407. Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights. The provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities on the one hand and the holders of Senior Indebtedness (and, in the case of Section 1415, Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations) on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall (a) impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and other than Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations and the Holders of the Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional (and which, subject to the rights under this Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness and Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations, is intended to rank equally with all other general obligations of the Company), to pay to the Holders of the Securities the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms; or (b) affect the relative rights against the Company of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness and Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations; or (c) prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness and under Section 1415 of Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations, to receive cash, property and securities otherwise payable or deliverable to the Trustee or such Holder. SECTION 1408. Trustee to Effectuate Subordination. Each Holder of a Security by his acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. SECTION 1409. No Waiver of Subordination Provisions. No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any non-compliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness (and Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations) may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Securities and without impairing -60-
or releasing the subordination provided in this Article or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Securities to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness or Other Financial Obligations, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Indebtedness or Other Financial Obligations or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is or Other Financial Obligations are outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness or Other Financial Obligations; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Indebtedness or Other Financial Obligations; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person. SECTION 1410. Notice to Trustee. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities, unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or a holder of Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee therefor or from any Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations; and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist. Subject to the provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee therefor) or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee therefor) or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article, the Trustee may, but shall not be required to, request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness or other Financial Obligations held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. SECTION 1411. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of Liquidating Agent. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601, and the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person making -61-
such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company and the Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article. SECTION 1412. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Persons. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations and shall not be liable to any such holders or creditors if it shall in good faith pay over or distribute to Holders of Securities or to the Company or to any other Person cash, property or securities to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise. SECTION 1413. Rights of Trustee as Holder of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Person; Preservation of Trustee's Rights. The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Senior Indebtedness which may at any time be held by it and with respect to any Other Financial Obligations owed to the Trustee as an Entitled Person, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Person in respect of Other Financial Obligations, as the case may be, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder or Entitled Person. Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607. SECTION 1414. Article Applicable to Paying Agents. In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee; provided, however, that Section 1413 shall not apply to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as Paying Agent. SECTION 1415. Payment of Proceeds in Certain Cases. (a) Subject to the provisions of this Section and to any provisions established or determined with respect to Securities of any series pursuant to Section 301, the Securities shall rank pari passu in right of payment with each other. (b) Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of Section 1402, the provisions of that Section shall be given effect on a pro rata basis to determine the amount of cash, property of securities which may be payable or -62-
deliverable as between the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the one hand, and the Holders of Securities, on the other hand. (c) If, after giving effect to the provisions of Section 1402, Section 1406 and the respective corresponding provisions of each indenture or other instrument or document establishing or governing the terms of any Senior Indebtedness on such pro rata basis, any amount of cash, property or securities shall be available for payment or distribution in respect of the Securities ("Excess Proceeds"), and any Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations shall not have received payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of such Other Financial Obligations (and provision shall not have been made for such payment in money or money's worth), then such Excess Proceeds shall first be applied (ratably with any amount of cash, property or securities available for payment or distribution in respect of any other indebtedness of the Company that by its express terms provides for the payment over of amounts corresponding to Excess Proceeds to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations) to pay or provide for the payment of the Other Financial Obligations remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all Other Financial Obligations in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations. Any Excess Proceeds remaining after the payment (or provision for payment) in full of all Other Financial Obligations shall be available for payment or distribution in respect of the Securities. (d) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of subsection (c) of this Section, after the occurrence of any of the events specified in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of Section 1402, the Trustee or Holder of any Security shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, before all Other Financial Obligations are paid in full or payment thereof duly provided for, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment or distribution, have been made known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event, subject to any obligation that the Trustee or such Holder may have pursuant to Section 1402, such payment or distribution shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other Person making payment or distribution of assets of the Company for payment in accordance with subsection (c). (e) Subject to the payment in full of all Other Financial Obligations, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the Company that by its express terms provides for the payment over of amounts corresponding to Excess Proceeds to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the extent of the payments or distributions made to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of this Section to the rights of the Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Other Financial Obligations until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities shall be paid in full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations of any cash, property or securities to which Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Section, and no payments over pursuant to the provisions of this Section to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations by Holders of Securities or the Trustee, shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than Entitled Persons in respect of Other Financial Obligations and the Holders of Securities -63-
be deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of the Other Financial Obligations.
