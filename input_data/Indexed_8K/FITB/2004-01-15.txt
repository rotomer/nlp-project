News Release
 
 
 
Fifth Third Bancorp's 2003 fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were $.80, an increase of 11 percent over $.72 per diluted share for the same period in 2002. Fourth quarter net income totaled $460,499,000, a nine percent increase over fourth quarter 2002's net income of $423,372,000. Fourth quarter return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 2.02 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively, compared to 2.11 percent and 19.8 percent in 2002's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share for the full year 2003 were $3.03, an increase of 10 percent over last year's earnings of $2.76. ROA for the full year 2003 was 2.01 percent and ROE was 20.4 percent, compared to 2.18 percent and 19.9 percent, respectively, in 2002.
 
"I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work in producing another good year for our shareholders," stated George A. Schaefer, Jr., President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "While 2003 was certainly not an easy year, I believe we have accomplished a great deal. We were faced with the lowest level of interest rates in over 40 years, earning asset yields and margins declining to levels not seen since the 1970's and business and economic stress in some segments of the economy that resulted in credit losses well in excess of our historical averages. Despite these factors, we were able to produce double-digit earnings growth driven by a focused loan and deposit sales effort and continued growth from our service businesses. We also invested significantly in strengthening your investment in Fifth Third for the years to come by adding new banking center locations in vibrant growth markets, increasing automation of processes, building a comprehensive risk management infrastructure and welcoming numerous talented and experienced bankers to the Fifth Third team."
 
"Fifth Third continues to be defined by the same core operating principles that have served us well over the years. We believe a focused and energetic sales force, conservative risk profile, diversified business mix and a unique, decentralized affiliate banking model effectively position Fifth Third to continue to deliver consistent earnings growth. With the significant investments we have made in the expansion of our sales force, new banking centers and improvements in infrastructure, we enter 2004 with optimism and look forward to meeting the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead."
 
Balance Sheet Trends
 
Loan and lease balances exhibited extremely strong growth with period end loans and leases increasing by $6.4 billion in 2003 on a full year basis, driven primarily by very strong results in consumer lending and continued growth in commercial loans and leases. On an average basis, total loans and leases increased by 15 percent over last year. Direct installment loan originations continued recent year trends and remained strong throughout 2003, totaling $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and $7.4 billion for the full year compared to $1.7 billion in last year's fourth quarter and $6.7 billion for the full year 2002, driving an increase in installment loan balances of 14 percent over the same quarter last year. Consumer loans and comparisons to prior periods are impacted by the securitization and sale of $903 million in home equity lines of credit in the third quarter of 2003 and the inclusion of $750 million in automotive loans in held for sale. These actions were taken to limit balance
sheet leverage due to the exceptionally strong demand experienced in these asset classes over recent periods relative to the entire loan and lease portfolio. Period end commercial loan and lease balances increased by 12 percent over the same quarter last year and by $950 million, or 14 percent on an annualized basis, from last quarter. Improving demand and customer additions in middle-market and small business commercial loan originations during the quarter were partially mitigated by modest year-end seasonal decreases in existing commercial line of credit utilization percentages across the footprint.
 
Significant numbers of commercial customer additions and net new retail checking account growth have resulted in very strong deposit growth trends for Fifth Third. Average demand deposit balances increased 18 percent and average interest checking balances grew nine percent compared to last year's fourth quarter, and 17 percent and 15 percent on the full year, respectively. Compared to the third quarter of this year, average transaction account balances increased by eight percent on an annualized basis highlighted by 22 percent annualized growth in demand deposits and 13 percent annualized growth in interest checking balances. The level of savings, money market, and time deposit balances continued to moderate in the fourth quarter given the low level of interest rates. Fifth Third's most recent consumer checking account campaign, The Fall Classic, concluded on December 15, 2003 at 155 percent of goal with $1.3 billion in new checking account balances. Fifth Third is continuing to devote significant marketing and sales focus on checking account growth in its retail and commercial franchises.
 
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2002, net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased five percent despite a 26 basis point (bp) decrease in the net interest margin due to 13 percent growth in average earning assets. On a full year basis, the eight percent increase in net interest income over 2002 was primarily driven by 18 percent growth in average earning assets mitigated by a 34 bp reduction in the net interest margin as all asset classes experienced accelerated prepayment rates in 2003 due to the low interest rate environment. Sequentially, net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased five percent on an annualized basis due to the positive impact of the recent slowing of prepayment speeds on the net interest margin and modest growth in the level of average earning assets. Fifth Third expects that margin and net interest income trends in coming periods will be dependent upon the magnitude of deposit growth in relation to balance sheet growth and the speed of interest rate changes in an improving economy.
 
Fifth Third repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of its common stock for a total of approximately $271 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 11.5 million shares for a total of approximately $655 million in all of 2003. With increasing capital levels and greater stability in earning asset yields anticipated in 2004, Fifth Third continues to view share repurchases as an effective means of returning excess capital to shareholders. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining authority under the plan authorized by the Board of Directors in March 2003 is approximately 14.1 million shares.
 
Other Operating Income
 
Other Operating Income increased three percent over the same quarter last year and 14 percent on a full year basis with double-digit growth in major captions partially mitigated by significant decreases in the level of gains on sales of securities and loans.
 
Fifth Third Processing Solutions, our Electronic Payment Processing division, delivered a nine percent increase in revenues over the fourth quarter of last year, 12 percent on full year basis and 47 percent on a seasonally strong annualized sequential basis. Comparisons to 2002 prior periods are impacted by a slowdown in transaction volume growth rates on the existing customer base reflective of current economic conditions, sluggish growth in the retail sector of the economy and an $8 million fourth quarter revenue impact ($13 million full year 2003) associated with the recent MasterCard/Visa settlement. Revenue from Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) was essentially flat compared to the same quarter last year and merchant processing increased 15 percent over the same quarter last year despite growth of only approximately six percent in transaction volumes from the existing merchant customer base. Along with the introduction of Fifth Third's POS Check Services at
 
Pearle Visions locations, significant new processing customers welcomed during the fourth quarter of 2003 include Sovereign Bancorp, AFFN (Armed Forces Financial Network), Steak n' Shake, Limited TOO Brands, and Atwood's Distributing. Additionally, Fifth Third received several major contract extensions including Saks Incorporated, Barnes and Noble, Bealls Incorporated and Fisher's Foods. Fifth Third Processing Solutions now handles electronic processing for over 197,000 merchant locations and 1,500 financial institutions worldwide.
 
Successful sales of retail and commercial deposit accounts and corporate treasury management products fueled increases in deposit service revenues of 11 percent over the same quarter last year and 13 percent for the full year. The fourth quarter increase was highlighted by a nine percent increase in retail deposit based revenues and a 13 percent increase in commercial deposit based revenues over the same quarter last year on the strength of Fifth Third's continuing focus on cross-sell initiatives, new customer relationships and the benefit of a lower interest rate environment.
 
Mortgage net service revenue totaled $57.2 million in the fourth quarter and $301.7 million on a full year 2003 basis compared to $66.7 million in 2002's fourth quarter and $187.9 million in all of 2002. Inclusive of net realized securities gains/losses resulting from sales from a portfolio established to hedge against volatility related to the value of mortgage servicing rights, mortgage net service revenue was $304.5 million on a full year basis in 2003 and $221.4 million on a full year basis in 2002. Mortgage originations totaled $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter versus $4.9 billion last quarter and $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. The $17.6 million decrease in mortgage banking revenues relative to last quarter is primarily attributable to declines in the level of refinance activity as mortgage interest rates continued to increase from record lows. Fifth Third is aggressively reducing mortgage banking volume-related processing expenses as originations have slowed in recent periods. Fourth quarter mortgage net service revenue was comprised of $80.8 million in total mortgage banking fees and loan sales, less $12.7 million of losses and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments and less $10.9 million in net valuation adjustments and amortization on mortgage servicing rights. The mark-to-market adjustments and settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments and corresponding valuation adjustments resulted from the movement of interest rates during the quarter and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, is $289.0 million at December 31, 2003, compared to $274.6 million last quarter and $263.5 million a year ago.
 
Investment Advisory revenues increased 14 percent over the same quarter last year and two percent on a full year basis. The increase in service revenue compared to the same quarter last year resulted primarily from strengthening sales results in Retirement Plan Services and improved institutional asset management revenues from better market performance. Fifth Third continues to focus its sales efforts on integrating services across business lines and working closely with retail and commercial team members to take advantage of a diverse and expanding customer base. Fifth Third Investment Advisors, among the largest money managers in the Midwest, has $35 billion in assets under management and $194 billion in assets under care.
 
Other service charges and fee revenue totaled $112.5 million in the fourth quarter and $581.4 million on a full year basis, compared to $164.0 million in the same quarter last year and $579.7 million in all of 2002. The decrease in revenue relative to the fourth quarter last year is primarily attributable to the previously disclosed fourth quarter 2002 pre-tax gain of approximately $26 million realized from the sale of the property and casualty insurance agency product line operations representing approximately $26 million in revenue on a full year 2002 basis. Sequential quarter comparisons are impacted by the previously disclosed third quarter 2003 $22 million gain from the securitization and sale of $903 million of home equity lines of credit and declines in both indirect consumer and commercial loan and lease fees. On a full year comparison basis, commercial banking revenues increased 13 percent, institutional fixed income trading and sales revenues increased 47 percent and cardholder fee revenue increased 15 percent.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Operating expenses increased 12 percent over the fourth quarter last year and 10 percent on a full year basis with direct comparisons to prior periods impacted by the following factors: (i) the early implementation of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46) in the third quarter of 2003 resulting in the recognition of depreciation expense captured as a component of operating expenses totaling $44.0 million in the fourth quarter and $93.5 million in all of 2003 on operating lease assets; (ii) an $82 million pre-tax charge realized in the third quarter of 2002 related to treasury clearing and other related settlement accounts; (iii) a $30.8 million pre-tax recovery of the above mentioned treasury charge realized as a credit to other operating expense in the second quarter of 2003; and (iv) a charge of $20.1 million related to the early retirement of approximately $200 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances in the second quarter of 2003. Fifth Third's efficiency ratio stands at 47.3 percent in the fourth quarter and 45.0 percent in 2003 compared to 44.0 percent in the fourth quarter last year and 44.9 percent in 2002.
 
Excluding the impact of the above mentioned factors, operating expenses increased by four percent over the same quarter last year and 11 percent on a full year basis; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of the fundamental trends in operating expenses. The increases over last year are primarily attributable to the implications of growth in all of our markets and increases in spending related to the expansion and improvement of our sales force, third-party consulting, continuing investment in support personnel, process improvement, technology and infrastructure to support recent and future growth and increasing insurance and other employee benefit expenses. Fifth Third has also invested significantly in the growth of its retail banking platform with the opening of 58 new banking centers since December of 2002. Near-term improvement continues to be expected from certain volume related expense items and efficiency initiatives related to non-risk management expenses. As part of our core emphasis on operating leverage, these initiatives include increasing levels of automation of processes, the rationalization and reduction of non-core businesses as they relate to our retail and middle market commercial customer base, returns on invested capital and related opportunities for continued growth in 2004 and years to come.
 
Credit Quality
 
Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 72 bp in the fourth quarter and 63 bp in all of 2003, compared to 59 bp last quarter and 43 bp in all of 2002. Nonperforming assets (NPA's) were 61 bp of total loans and leases and other real estate owned at December 31, 2003, improved from 62 bp posted last quarter. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs remain a small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. Net charge-offs were $95.0 million in the fourth quarter and $312.2 million in 2003, compared to $49.5 million in the same quarter last year and $186.8 million in all of 2002. Commercial loan and lease net charge-offs totaled $54.0 million in the fourth quarter with the increase relative to prior periods primarily due to the charge-off of two airline leases totaling approximately $18 million. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $93.7 million in the fourth quarter and $399.4 million for the full year, compared to $72.1 million in the same quarter last year and $246.6 million in the full year 2002. Fifth Third expects near-term improvement in the level of commercial loan losses and nonperforming assets as the overall economy in the Bank's Midwestern footprint continues to build upon recent positive momentum.
 
Corporate Trust Sale
 
On December 29, 2003, Fifth Third completed the sale of its corporate trust business which resulted in a $62 million pre-tax ($40 million after-tax) gain in the fourth quarter of 2003. Corporate trust services has been a relatively small contributor to both total revenues and earnings for Fifth Third in all periods. Fifth Third remains committed to offering trust services as part of our relationship based approach to commercial banking and will continue to be a part of a complete product set for our middle market commercial clients. The sale allows us to refine our focus and reinvest in our core businesses that provide the best return to our shareholders. As a result of this sale and cessation of any continuing involvement in the operations of the corporate trust business, the results
 
of these operations and the corresponding gain are being reported as discontinued operations in the current and all prior periods. The following table summarizes the results of operations of this business.
