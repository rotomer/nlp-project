Item 9.
Regulation FD Disclosure
 
To assist investors, financial analysts and other interested parties in their analysis of Fifth Third Bancorp, the Registrant developed the document attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K. This document, incorporated herein by reference, is furnished, not filed.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Fifth Third Bancorp has developed the document attached as Exhibit 99.1 containing a general trend overview of Fifth Third's objectives, financial condition and results of operations for the second quarter of 2004.
 
 
 
Service Income
 
In general, management expects service income categories to exhibit positive trends and strong momentum. Specifically, by major category:
 
Electronic Payment Processing
 
On April 1, 2004, Fifth Third sold certain out-of-footprint third-party sourced merchant processing contracts. These contracts represented approximately $22 million in quarterly revenue that was previously reported as a component of Electronic Payment Processing Revenue with comparisons to last year's second quarter also impacted by an approximate $7 million from the MasterCard/Visa settlement. On an overall basis, Fifth Third expects that second quarter processing revenues will be essentially unchanged from last quarter. Exclusive of the impact of the above referenced items, second quarter revenues are expected to increase in the low 30 percent range on a core basis over the same quarter last year due to strong new business and improving retail sales volume activity.
 
Investment Advisory
 
Fifth Third expects second quarter investment advisory revenues to produce mid to high-teen percentage growth over the second quarter of last year with institutional and brokerage revenues leading broad-based strength. On a sequential quarter basis, revenues are expected to increase at a double-digit annualized rate.
 
Deposit Service Revenue
 
Retail and commercial deposit account service revenues are expected to produce high single to low double digit percent year-over-year growth rates as Fifth Third has continued to generate new accounts in all of our markets and service charges continue to benefit from sales campaigns and a low rate environment. Commercial treasury management revenues are showing good year-over-year growth as our sales force continues to add new customers and deepen existing relationships with additional products and services.
 
Mortgage Banking
 
Second quarter mortgage banking revenues are expected to improve significantly from first quarter levels highlighted by modestly better than expected origination activity, particularly adjustable rate mortgages. As mortgage interest rates continue to increase from record lows, Fifth Third expects mortgage banking revenues in the second half of the year to stabilize at levels similar to those seen in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Expenses
 
Balance Sheet Trends and Net Interest Income
 
Fifth Third expects mid single digit year-over-year percentage growth in net interest income over last year's second quarter. The net interest margin is expected to be essentially stable in the second quarter (relative to the first quarter) due to the continued benefits of steepness in the short end of the yield curve and moderation in the level of prepayment activity. Margin trends in future periods will be dependent upon the magnitude of deposit growth in relation to balance sheet growth and the speed of interest rate changes in the economy.
 
 
 
 
Credit Quality
 
Fifth Third is realistic about the difficulty in precisely estimating credit quality metrics. Fifth Third's long history of conservative exposure limits, avoidance of national or sub-prime lending businesses, centralized credit risk management, and diversified portfolio position us well to effectively weather cycles and reduce the likelihood of significant unexpected losses. As a result of expected credit trends and an overall improving credit outlook, Fifth Third does not expect increases in the reserve for credit losses at levels similar to those seen during 2003. On an overall basis:
