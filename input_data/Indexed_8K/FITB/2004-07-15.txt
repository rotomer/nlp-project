Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Fifth Third Bancorp's 2004 second quarter earnings per diluted share were $.79, an increase of 11 percent over $.71 per diluted share for the same period in 2003. Second quarter net income totaled $447,525,000, an eight percent increase over second quarter 2003's net income of $415,275,000. Second quarter return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 1.91 percent and 21.0 percent, respectively, compared to 1.92 percent and 18.6 percent in 2003's second quarter.
"Second quarter results reflect favorable momentum across nearly all of Fifth Third's businesses," stated George A. Schaefer, Jr., President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "Strong sales results from our investment advisors and electronic payment processing businesses and continued strength in commercial and retail, including mortgage banking, offer reason for optimism as the economy shows more strength. Credit quality trends continue to improve and expenses remain well controlled as a result of our focus on productivity initiatives. Our focus for the remainder of 2004 and into 2005 continues to be on investing in our larger markets to build a best-in-class branch network and generating growth on every street corner we serve."
"While the direction of the economy and the numerous changes in market sentiment remain well beyond our control, I continue to be very pleased with the successes we have achieved in terms of hiring talented and experienced sales people and the level of investment we have made in our larger markets. The environment will continue to offer challenges as the industry navigates a period of rising interest rates, however, Fifth Third's strong capital base and conservatively positioned balance sheet, diversified business mix, large core deposit funding base and, most importantly, a proven sales culture, position us well to manage in this climate. We believe these strengths, combined with the tremendous amount of upside we have in our larger markets and successful de-novo growth, provide Fifth Third the ability to compete very aggressively in any rate environment."
Noninterest Income
Recent strong business line revenue growth trends continued in the second quarter with Noninterest Income increasing 21 percent over the same quarter last year.
Investment Advisory revenues increased 17 percent over the same quarter last year and 17 percent on a year-to-date basis primarily as a result of strong sales momentum across numerous product lines including retail brokerage, institutional asset management and private client services. Fifth Third continues to focus its sales efforts on integrating services across business lines and working closely with retail and commercial team members to take advantage of a diverse and expanding customer base. Fifth Third Investment Advisors, among the largest money managers in the Midwest, has $35 billion in assets under management and $171 billion in assets under care.
Fifth Third Processing Solutions, our electronic payment processing division, delivered a five percent increase in revenues over the second quarter of last year. Comparisons to prior periods are impacted by the April 1, 2004 sale of certain out-of-footprint third-party sourced merchant processing contracts acquired through previous acquisitions that neither met Fifth Third's return requirements nor offered additional sales opportunities. The revenue previously realized from these sold merchant contracts along with the reduction of approximately $7 million in revenue from the MasterCard/Visa settlement combined to represent a reduction of approximately $29 million in quarterly revenue that was previously reported as a component of electronic payment processing revenues. Exclusive of the impact of the above referenced items, second quarter revenues increased by 25 percent on a core basis over the same quarter last year reflective of strong new business acquisition and improved retail sales volume activity; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of these fundamental revenue trends.
Successful sales of retail and commercial deposit accounts and corporate treasury management products fueled an increase in deposit service revenues of nine percent over the same quarter last year and 26 percent on an annualized sequential basis. The second quarter results were highlighted by a 21 percent increase in commercial deposit based revenues over the same quarter last year on the strength of Fifth Third's continuing focus on new customer acquisition and cross-sell initiatives within its core middle-market commercial banking franchise. Retail-based deposit revenues rebounded from the seasonal lows typically seen in the first quarter and posted 41 percent annualized sequential growth.
Mortgage Banking net service revenue totaled $60.7 million in the second quarter compared to $43.9 million last quarter and $92.8 million in 2003's second quarter. Including net realized securities gains resulting from the sale of the remaining securities portfolio established to partially hedge against volatility related to the value of mortgage servicing rights, mortgage banking net service revenue totaled $94.6 million in the second quarter of last year. Mortgage originations totaled $2.8 billion in the second quarter versus $2.0 billion last quarter and $4.9 billion in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter mortgage banking net service revenue was comprised of $70.0 million in total mortgage banking fees and loan sales, plus $33.7
 
million in net valuation adjustments and amortization on mortgage servicing rights and less $43.0 million of losses and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments. The mark-to-market adjustments and settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments and corresponding valuation adjustments resulted from interest rate volatility and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $341.4 million at June 30, 2004, compared to $274.4 million last quarter, on a servicing portfolio of $23.9 billion.
Other noninterest income totaled $268.6 million in the second quarter, a 93 percent increase from the second quarter last year and a 91 percent increase from last quarter. Second quarter 2004 results include a pre-tax gain of approximately $148 million ($84.6 million after-tax) on the previously mentioned sale of certain out-of-footprint third-party sourced merchant processing contracts representing approximately $22 million in quarterly revenue.
 
Balance Sheet Trends
Loan and lease balances exhibited very strong growth with period end loans and leases held for investment increasing by $2.2 billion from last quarter, excluding loans acquired as a result of the completion of the Franklin Financial acquisition, or 16 percent on an annualized sequential basis, driven primarily by strong results in both consumer and commercial lending. On an average basis, total loans and leases increased by nine percent over the same quarter last year. Direct installment loan originations accelerated during the second quarter and totaled $2.0 billion, compared to $1.5 billion last quarter, with period-end balances, excluding acquired loans, increasing by 11 percent over the second quarter of last year and 10 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Consumer loan comparisons to prior periods are impacted by the securitization and sale of $903 million in home equity lines of credit in the third quarter of 2003 and the securitization and sale of $750 million of automotive loans in the second quarter of 2004. Exclusive of the impact of these transactions, consumer loan growth increased 21 percent over the same quarter last year; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of the fundamental trends in consumer lending. Period end commercial loan and lease balances, excluding acquired loans, increased by 11 percent over the same quarter last year and by $900 million from last quarter.
Commercial customer additions and net new retail checking account growth, mitigated by attrition in higher balance interest bearing accounts, resulted in modest deposit trends for Fifth Third in the second quarter of 2004. Compared to the same quarter last year, average interest checking balances and average demand deposit balances, excluding acquired deposits, increased by four percent and 22 percent, respectively, with average transaction account balances, excluding acquired deposits, increasing by six percent. On an overall basis, the level of average transaction account balances increased at an annualized rate of eight percent despite continued moderation in higher balance interest bearing accounts given the low level of interest rates.
 
Fifth Third is confident in its ability to competitively price and generate growth in customers and deposit balances in an increasing interest rate environment.
Compared to the second quarter of 2003, net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased three percent resulting from eight percent growth in average earning assets despite a 15 basis point (bp) decrease in the net interest margin. The previously disclosed implementation of SFAS No. 150 during the third quarter of 2003 and the resulting reclassification of approximately $10 million of quarterly minority interest expense into interest expense, impacted net interest income and margin performance comparisons to the second quarter of 2003. Sequentially, net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased seven percent on an annualized basis despite 6 bp of contraction in the net interest margin due to strong growth in average earning assets. The contraction in the net interest margin from last quarter resulted from seasonality factors and efforts to improve the overall funding position for a rising interest rate environment. These factors more than offset the margin benefit realized from the early retirement of approximately $1 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances during the second quarter of 2004. Fifth Third expects that margin and net interest income trends in coming periods will continue to benefit from the steepness in the short end of the yield curve and moderation in the level of prepayment activity with absolute results dependent upon the magnitude of deposit growth in relation to balance sheet growth and the speed of interest rate changes in an improving economy. Fifth Third will aggressively pursue deposit growth as the key determinant to future margin and net interest income performance trends.
On June 11, 2004, Fifth Third completed the purchase of Franklin Financial Corporation and its subsidiary, Franklin National Bank, headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee, acquiring approximately $581 million in total loans and $767 million in total deposits. The total transaction value was approximately $317 million. Fifth Third Bank, N.A., a national bank headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee, now has approximately $1.3 billion in total assets, including approximately $880 million in total loans and leases and $840 million in total deposits.
Fifth Third repurchased approximately 8.5 million shares of its common stock for a total of approximately $459 million in the second quarter of 2004. With increasing capital levels and continued stability in earning asset yields anticipated in the remainder of 2004, Fifth Third continues to view share repurchases as an effective means of delivering value to shareholders. As of June 30, 2004, the remaining authority under the plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June of 2004 is slightly less than 40 million shares.
 
Credit Quality
 
Credit quality metrics and trends continued to improve in the second quarter. Second quarter net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 43 bp, compared to 54 bp last quarter and 64 bp in the second quarter of last year. Nonperforming assets were 50 bp of total loans, leases and other assets,
 
including other real estate owned at June 30, 2004, improved from 57 bp posted last quarter. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs remain a small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $58.9 million, compared to $70.8 million last quarter and $77.5 million in the second quarter of 2003. The second quarter provision for loan and lease losses totaled $87.9 million, compared to $83.2 million last quarter and $108.9 million in the same quarter last year, including a $29.0 million increase in the credit loss reserve from last quarter which represents 1.43 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of June 30, 2004, compared to 1.49 percent as of June 30, 2003.
 
Noninterest Expense
Second quarter noninterest expense increased 20 percent over the same period last year and 14 percent from last quarter. Comparisons to the same period last year are impacted by (i) the implementation of FASB Interpretation No. 46 in the third quarter of 2003, resulting in the recognition of $32 million of depreciation expense in the 2004 second quarter on operating lease assets captured as a component of noninterest expense; (ii) a charge of $20.1 million related to the early retirement of approximately $200 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances in the second quarter of 2003; (iii) a $30.8 million pre-tax recovery in the second quarter of 2003 of previously charged-off treasury clearing and settlement account balances; and (iv) a charge of $78.1 million related to the early retirement of approximately $1 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances in the second quarter of 2004. Excluding the impact of these items, noninterest expense was essentially unchanged from the same quarter last year; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of the fundamental trends in noninterest expense.
Fifth Third's second quarter efficiency ratio was 48.9 percent, compared to 47.1 percent last quarter and 45.5 percent in the second quarter of last year. Fifth Third is continuing to focus on efficiency initiatives as part of our core emphasis on operating leverage. These initiatives include increasing levels of automation of processes, the rationalization and reduction of non-core businesses as they relate to our retail and middle market commercial customer base, returns on invested capital and related opportunities for continued growth in 2004 and years to come. Fifth Third is also continuing to invest significantly in its retail distribution network as evidenced by the opening of 42 new banking centers that did not involve consolidation of existing facilities since the beginning of the year and the plans for a similar number in the second half of 2004.
