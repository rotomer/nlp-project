Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ: FITB) and First National Bankshares of Florida, Inc (NYSE: FLB) announced today the signing of a definitive agreement in which Fifth Third will acquire First National Bankshares and its subsidiaries, headquartered in Naples, Florida. First National's presence, including pending acquisitions, will include approximately $5.3 billion in total assets, $3.9 billion in total deposits, and 77 full-service banking centers located primarily in the fast-growing markets of Orlando, Tampa Bay, Sarasota, Naples and Fort Myers. First National is the largest bank holding company headquartered in the state of Florida.
 
Fifth Third President & CEO George A. Schaefer, Jr., states, "This acquisition provides Fifth Third with a tremendous opportunity in the state of Florida, among the fastest growing deposit markets in the United States. Gary Tice, Kevin Hale and Garrett Richter have built a high quality franchise in an attractive region. We're pleased that the foundation they have built will easily complement Fifth Third's affiliate bank operating model. We entered this market in 1989 and under the leadership of Colleen Kvetko, have grown our Naples franchise to 16 full-service locations and $1 billion in assets. We're confident that First National's expanding presence  and the combined leadership team  will be an integral part of the Bank's continuing growth. When the acquisition is complete, Fifth Third will have over 90 Banking Centers and over $6 billion in managed assets in Florida. We believe this is an excellent opportunity for customers, shareholders and employees alike."
 
Gary Tice, Chairman and CEO, First National, states, "We are extremely proud to partner with an organization as successful as Fifth Third. They have an exceptional long-term track record of delivering shareholder value. We share the same core values and all of our stakeholders will benefit from the expanded resources, emphasis on local market decision making and dedication to individual communities at Fifth Third."
 
Under the terms of the agreement, which has been approved by both boards of directors, First National shareholders will receive .5065 shares of Fifth Third common stock for each share of First National. Based on the price of Fifth Third shares at the close of business on Friday July 30, 2004, the transaction is valued at $25.00 per First National share, for a total transaction value of approximately $1.58 billion, inclusive of pending acquisitions. Including pending acquisitions, First National is expected to have approximately 63 million diluted shares outstanding. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2005 and is subject to normal regulatory approvals in addition to the approval of First National's shareholders.
The companies expect the transaction to break even in 2005, under modest share repurchase assumptions and without revenue synergies, and generate approximately $50 million in annual pre-tax expense reductions following completion, with 75 percent to be realized in 2005 and 100 percent thereafter. These savings equal 35 percent of First National's annualized expense base. The companies expect one-time costs, including acquisition-related and restructuring charges will not exceed $100 million on a pre-tax basis over the integration period. Additional information regarding First National, Fifth Third and the terms of this transaction is available in a presentation on the investor relations section of Fifth Third's website at www.53.com.
