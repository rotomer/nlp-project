Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Fifth Third Bancorp's 2004 third quarter earnings per diluted share were $.83, an increase of 15 percent over $.72 per diluted share for the same period in 2003. Third quarter net income totaled $471 million, a 13 percent increase over third quarter 2003's net income of $417 million. Third quarter return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 1.95 percent and 21.1 percent, respectively, compared to 1.85 percent and 19.3 percent in 2003's third quarter. Third quarter 2004 earnings were positively impacted by a $27 million decrease in the reserve for credit losses and the corresponding decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses resulting from the recent improvement and expected stability in credit quality trends.
"It's gratifying to deliver strong growth to our shareholders in what continues to be a difficult operating environment," stated George A. Schaefer, Jr., President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "This quarter's results offer reason for optimism in a number of areas including strong deposit growth trends, strong credit quality performance and controlled expense levels. However, a prolonged period of extremely low interest rates continues to pressure spread revenues and the relative value provided by a well-capitalized balance sheet and strong deposit franchise has continued to diminish. In the face of the resulting slowdown in revenue growth, Fifth Third has been intently focused on investing for the future growth of your company by continuing to build best-in-class retail banking center networks in our larger markets as represented by the opening of our 1,000
th
banking center in August. We have also continued to hire talented and experienced sales people throughout our footprint by continuing to deliver products and services through a business model that encourages entrepreneurial thinking and high-touch customer service. These efforts, combined with a core competency in deposit growth and strong underlying trends in our payment processing and asset management businesses, demonstrate our commitment and focus in overcoming these challenges and delivering growth to our shareholders now and in the future."
"In August, Fifth Third announced an agreement to acquire First National Bankshares of Florida, Inc., a $5.3 billion asset bank holding company with a presence in deposit rich markets including Orlando, Tampa
and the west coast of Florida. When the acquisition is complete, Fifth Third will have over 90 banking centers and more than $6 billion in assets in Florida. The combined franchise will feature an experienced local management team, a compelling opportunity to expand our asset management business and attractive demographic trends including a large Midwestern client base already familiar with Fifth Third. We believe that improved sales management practices, increased resources and product capabilities and continued de-novo expansion delivered through a local market operating model will drive impressive growth for many years to come. We are extremely optimistic about the opportunities in the market and expect Fifth Third Bank (Florida) to become a much larger and increasingly valuable part of your company."
 
Noninterest Income
Investment Advisory revenues increased by four percent over the same quarter last year and 12 percent on a year-to-date basis primarily as a result of sales momentum across numerous product lines including retail brokerage and institutional asset management. Fifth Third expects near and intermediate term revenue growth to be driven by the degree of success in continuing to grow the institutional money management business and in penetrating a large middle market commercial customer base with retirement and wealth planning services. Fifth Third Investment Advisors, among the largest money managers in the Midwest, has $34 billion in assets under management and $176 billion in assets under care.
Fifth Third Processing Solutions, our electronic payment processing division, delivered a six percent increase in revenues over the third quarter of last year. Comparisons to prior periods are impacted by the April 1, 2004 sale of certain out-of-footprint third-party sourced merchant processing contracts acquired through previous acquisitions that neither met Fifth Third's return requirements nor offered additional cross-selling opportunities. The revenue previously realized from these sold merchant contracts represents a reduction of approximately $22 million in quarterly revenue previously reported as a component of electronic payment processing revenues. Exclusive of the impact of the above referenced item in the prior year period, third quarter revenues increased by 26 percent on a core basis over the same quarter last year primarily on the strength of new business and strong results from both merchant processing and electronic funds transfer; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of these fundamental revenue trends.
Successful sales of retail and commercial deposit accounts and corporate treasury management products fueled an increase in deposit service revenues of seven percent over the same quarter last year and 10 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Third quarter results were highlighted by a 13 percent increase in commercial deposit based revenues over the same quarter last year on the strength of Fifth Third's continuing focus on sales force additions, new customer acquisition and cross-sell initiatives within its core middle-market commercial banking franchise. Retail deposit based revenues continue to show improvement and posted 15 percent annualized sequential growth.
 
Mortgage Banking net service revenue totaled $49 million in the third quarter compared to $61 million last quarter and $75 million in 2003's third quarter. Mortgage originations totaled $1.7 billion in the third quarter versus $2.8 billion last quarter and $4.9 billion in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter mortgage banking net service revenue was comprised of $45 million in total mortgage banking fees and loan sales, plus $25 million of gains and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments and less $21 million in net valuation adjustments and amortization on mortgage servicing rights. The mark-to-market adjustments and settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments and corresponding valuation adjustments resulted from interest rate volatility and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $334 million at September 30, 2004 on a servicing portfolio of $23.5 billion, compared to $341 million last quarter on a servicing portfolio of $23.9 billion.
Other noninterest income totaled $137 million in the third quarter, compared to $269 million last quarter and $171 million in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter 2003 results were impacted by a $22 million gain on the securitization and sale of $903 million of home equity lines of credit. Second quarter 2004 results included a pre-tax gain of approximately $148 million ($85 million after-tax) on the sale of certain third-party sourced merchant processing contracts. Third quarter 2004 results include a $9 million pre-tax gain on the sale of certain small merchant processing contracts. Exclusive of these items, other noninterest income experienced modest increases across nearly all sub-categories relative to last quarter with decreases relative to the same period last year largely concentrated in loan and lease fees.
 
Balance Sheet Trends
Commercial customer additions and strong retail transaction account growth from a successful third quarter deposit campaign resulted in strong deposit trends in the third quarter of 2004. Compared to the second quarter of 2004, average transaction account balances increased by $1.6 billion, or 15 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Compared to the same quarter last year, average transaction account balances increased by seven percent highlighted by a 15 percent increase in average demand deposits. Fifth Third is intently focused on generating growth in customers and deposit balances and remains confident in its ability to competitively price and generate growth through an increasing interest rate environment. Deposit comparisons to the third quarter of 2003 are impacted by the addition of approximately $767 million in total deposits in conjunction with the second quarter 2004 acquisition of Franklin Financial Corporation. Exclusive of the impact of this transaction, average transaction account balances increased by six percent over the same quarter last year; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of the fundamental deposit trends.
Loan and lease balances exhibited good growth with period end loans and leases held for investment increasing by $1.4 billion from last quarter, or 10 percent on an annualized sequential basis. On an average
 
basis, total loans and leases increased by seven percent over the same quarter last year. Period end commercial loan and lease balances increased by 14 percent over the same quarter last year and by $509 million, or seven percent on an annualized basis, from last quarter. Direct installment loan originations remained solid during the third quarter and totaled $1.8 billion, compared to $2.0 billion last quarter, with period-end balances increasing by four percent over the third quarter of last year and seven percent on an annualized sequential basis. Loan and lease comparisons to prior periods are impacted by the securitization and sale of $750 million of automotive loans in the second quarter of 2004 and the addition of approximately $581 million in total loans in conjunction with the second quarter 2004 acquisition of Franklin Financial Corporation. Exclusive of the impact of these transactions, total commercial loan and lease balances increased 12 percent and total consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgages, increased six percent over the same quarter last year; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of fundamental lending trends.
Compared to the third quarter of 2003, net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis increased four percent resulting from eight percent growth in average earning assets despite a 10 basis point (bp) decrease in the net interest margin. Sequentially, net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis decreased by $5 million despite good growth in average earning assets due to 12 bp of contraction in the net interest margin. The contraction in the net interest margin from last quarter resulted from efforts to reduce interest rate risk and improve the long-term profile of Fifth Third. These efforts included (i) the termination of approximately $2.2 billion in notional of receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps resulting in an approximate $4 million negative impact to net interest income from the loss of positive spread and termination charges in the third quarter, (ii) increased rates offered on interest-bearing deposit accounts in order to improve the funding profile resulting in a 21 bp increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits and (iii) increased contribution of variable investment securities in the available-for-sale portfolio from 7 percent at December 31, 2003 to 15 percent at September 30, 2004. These initiatives, combined with strong loan and deposit sales results, have greatly improved Fifth Third's balance sheet positioning for rising short-term interest rates. Fifth Third will aggressively pursue deposit growth as the key determinant to future margin and net interest income performance trends.
 
Credit Quality
Credit quality metrics and trends continued to improve in the third quarter. Third quarter net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 40 bp, compared to 43 bp last quarter and 59 bp in the third quarter of last year. Nonperforming assets were 48 bp of total loans, leases and other assets, including other real estate owned at September 30, 2004, improved from the 50 bp posted last quarter. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $57 million, compared to $59 million last quarter and $75 million in the third quarter of 2003. The third quarter provision for loan and lease losses totaled $30 million, compared to $88 million last quarter and $112 million in the same quarter last year. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets have
 
continued to improve in 2004 and have decreased by 23 percent and 13 percent, respectively, compared to third quarter of 2003. As a result of this improving credit experience, the overall expected stability in credit quality trends and improved overall loss rates within the commercial portfolio, Fifth Third realized a $27 million decrease in the reserve for credit losses during the third quarter. The reserve for credit losses represents 1.35 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of September 30, 2004, compared to 1.43 percent as of June 30, 2004 and 1.49 percent as of September 30, 2003.
 
Noninterest Expense
Third quarter noninterest expense decreased two percent over the same period last year and decreased by 13 percent from last quarter. Comparisons to last quarter are impacted by a charge of $78 million related to the early retirement of approximately $1 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances in the second quarter of 2004. Excluding the impact of this item, noninterest expense decreased by approximately $21 million from last quarter. Fifth Third's third quarter efficiency ratio was 46.8 percent, compared to 48.9 percent last quarter and 46.4 percent in the third quarter of last year. Fifth Third is continuing to focus on efficiency initiatives as part of a core emphasis on operating leverage. These initiatives include increasing process automation, an increased emphasis on required returns on invested capital and related opportunities for continued growth in 2004 and years to come. Fifth Third is also investing significantly in its retail distribution network as evidenced by the opening of 59 new banking centers that did not involve consolidation of existing facilities since the beginning of the year.
