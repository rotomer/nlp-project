Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Fifth Third Bancorp's 2005 first quarter earnings per diluted share were $.72 compared to $.75 per diluted share for the same period in 2004. First quarter net income totaled $405 million, a six percent decrease from first quarter 2004's net income of $430 million. First quarter earnings and balance sheet comparisons were impacted by the acquisition of First National Bankshares of Florida, Inc. ("First National"), including the recognition of $7 million of pre-tax acquisition related charges in the first quarter, or $.01 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of acquisition related charges, earnings per diluted share were $.73; a comparison being provided to supplement an understanding of fundamental earnings trends. First quarter return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 1.62 percent and 18.0 percent, respectively, compared to 1.88 percent and 19.7 percent in 2004's first quarter.
"We continue to make progress in returning to the type of performance our shareholders expect from us," stated George A. Schaefer, Jr., President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "While we are not satisfied with bottom line results, we are encouraged by deposit trends, solid momentum in adding new customers and excellent overall results from Fifth Third Processing Solutions. We also saw considerable strength in our lending businesses in the first quarter, highlighted by 24 percent growth in commercial loans and 16 percent growth in consumer loans. Ultimately, higher interest rates combined with good loan and deposit growth will result in strengthening spread based revenues. Credit quality in our loan and lease portfolios remains well behaved and we are continuing to see solid returns from our de-novo banking center expansion efforts, including the first quarter opening of our first banking center in Pittsburgh. However, challenges remain on several fronts. We are working hard to reinvigorate revenue growth in some of our service businesses and we will continue to seek productivity enhancements to drive greater efficiency in our back office operations. These enhancements, combined with expected trend improvement in spread based revenues, provide optimism that results will improve over the remainder of the year."

"The acquisition of First National, a $5.6 billion asset bank holding company located primarily in the fast-growing markets of Orlando, Tampa, Sarasota, Naples and Fort Myers, was announced in 2004 and completed this quarter. We completed conversion activity in February and have been investing in growth and aggressively expanding our sales force in these markets as we strive to deliver increased product and service capabilities to new and existing customers in our Florida markets."
 
Balance Sheet Trends
Retail transaction account and commercial customer additions resulted in good deposit trends in the first quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, average transaction account balances increased by $6.2 billion, or 15 percent, highlighted by 18 percent growth in average demand deposits and 35 percent growth in average savings and money market balances. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2004, average transaction account balances increased by $2.5 billion, or 22 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Fifth Third is intensely focused on generating growth in customers and deposit balances and remains confident in its ability to competitively price and generate growth in an increasing interest rate environment. Deposit comparisons to 2004 are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National and the second quarter 2004 acquisition of Franklin Financial Corporation ("Franklin Financial"). Exclusive of the impact of these transactions, average transaction account balances increased by eight percent over the same quarter last year and were essentially flat sequentially despite the significant seasonal increases in transaction deposits typically seen in the fourth quarter; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of the fundamental deposit trends.
Loan and lease balances exhibited continued strength with period end loans and leases increasing by $5.1 billion from last quarter, or 35 percent on an annualized sequential basis. On an average basis, total loans and leases, including held for sale, increased by 19 percent over the same quarter last year and by 38 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Period end commercial loan and lease balances increased by 24 percent over the same quarter last year and by $3.9 billion, or 50 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Period end consumer loan and lease balances excluding residential mortgage, increased by eight percent over the same quarter last year and by $805 million, or 15 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Loan and lease comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by the addition of approximately $3.9 billion in total loans in conjunction with the acquisition of First National and approximately $581 million in total loans in conjunction with the acquisition of Franklin Financial. Exclusive of the impact of these transactions, total commercial loan and lease balances increased 13 percent and total consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgages, increased six percent over last year. On an annualized sequential basis, commercial loan and lease balances increased 14 percent and consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgages, increased eight percent; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of fundamental lending trends.
Compared to the first quarter of 2004, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was essentially flat despite eight percent growth in average earning assets due to a 22 basis point (bp) decline in the

net interest margin. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2004, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased four percent on an annualized sequential basis, or $7 million, due to a three bp increase in the net interest margin and good growth in average earning assets mitigated by day count comparisons. Margin and net interest income trends and comparisons to prior periods are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National, including a modestly negative impact to net interest income from purchase accounting loan and deposit net amortization, the repurchase of common stock described in further detail later in this document and the full quarter average impact of previously disclosed balance sheet initiatives undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2004 to reduce the risks associated with increasing interest rates including: (i) sale of approximately $6.4 billion in the available-for-sale securities portfolio; (ii) the early retirement of approximately $2.8 billion of long-term debt; (iii) the termination of $2.8 billion in notional of receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps; and (iv) reductions in certain other wholesale borrowings. Margin trends in 2005 will depend upon the speed of further interest rate changes and the level and mix of earning asset and deposit growth.
On January 1, 2005, Fifth Third completed the acquisition of First National with the issuance of 30.6 million shares for a total purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. The transaction resulted in approximately $71 million in core deposit and other intangible assets, net of related deferred taxes, and approximately $1.2 billion in goodwill, inclusive of approximately $28 million of employee-related payments and certain contract termination charges, net of tax, recognized in the opening balance sheet. As previously announced, conversion activity was completed on February 14, 2005.
On January 10, 2005, Fifth Third repurchased 35.5 million shares of its common stock, approximately six percent of total outstanding shares, for approximately $1.6 billion in an overnight accelerated share repurchase transaction. The transaction provides that the counterparty will purchase shares in the market over a period of time. Upon completion, the Bancorp will receive or pay a price adjustment in the form of cash or shares, at its election, that is largely based on the volume weighted-average price of the shares purchased by the counterparty. On January 18, 2005, Fifth Third announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of 20 million shares of common stock through the open market or in any private transaction. The timing of the purchases and the exact number of shares to be purchased depends upon market conditions and may commence upon the completion of the overnight accelerated share repurchase transaction.
 
Noninterest Income
Fifth Third Processing Solutions, our electronic payment processing division, delivered a 13 percent increase in revenues over the same quarter last year. Comparisons to prior periods are impacted by the significant seasonal increases in transaction volumes typically seen in the fourth quarter and the sale of certain small merchant processing contracts in the second and third quarters of 2004. Excluding the $25 million revenue impact of sold contracts in the prior year period, first quarter revenues increased by 36 percent over the same period last year; a comparison being provided to supplement an understanding of the fundamental revenue trends.
 
Table of Contents
First quarter trends are representative of strong continuing momentum in attracting new customer relationships and good results in the level of retail sales activity. Fifth Third continues to see significant opportunities to attract new financial institution customers and retailers.
Investment Advisory revenues decreased by four percent over the same quarter last year and increased by 35 percent on an annualized sequential basis. The decrease in service revenue in the first quarter relative to last year resulted primarily from declines in retail brokerage related revenues. The increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter last year resulted primarily from seasonal strength in retail brokerage and improved results in institutional asset management and private client services. Fifth Third expects near and intermediate term revenue growth to be driven by the degree of success in continuing to grow the institutional money management business and in penetrating a large middle market commercial customer base with retirement and wealth planning services. Fifth Third Investment Advisors, among the largest money managers in the Midwest, has $34 billion in assets under management and $183 billion in assets under care.
Deposit service revenues decreased one percent compared to the same quarter last year despite growth in the number of consumer and commercial account relationships. Both retail and commercial deposit based revenues were essentially unchanged from prior year levels. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, commercial deposit based revenues were essentially flat despite increased activity and retail deposit based revenues declined eight percent due to both seasonal factors and declines in consumer overdraft related revenues.
Mortgage net service revenue totaled $41 million in the first quarter compared to $24 million last quarter and $44 million in 2004's first quarter. Mortgage originations totaled $1.9 billion in the first quarter versus $2.0 billion last quarter and $2.0 billion in the first quarter of last year. First quarter mortgage banking net service revenue was comprised of $47 million in total mortgage banking fees and loan sales, plus $4 million in amortization and valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights and less $10 million of losses and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments. The mark-to-market adjustments and settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments and corresponding valuation adjustments resulted from interest rate volatility and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $367 million at March 31, 2005 on a servicing portfolio of $23.3 billion, compared to $339 million last quarter on a servicing portfolio of $23.0 billion.
Other noninterest income totaled $153 million in the first quarter, an eight percent increase from the first quarter last year and a 20 percent increase from last quarter. Comparisons to prior periods are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National. Compared to the first quarter of last year, revenue improvement was realized in cardholder fees, commercial banking revenue, including strong performance in international, bank owned life insurance and customer derivative sales. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, revenue improvement was realized in cardholder fees, bank owned life insurance and student loan sales.

Credit Quality
Credit quality metrics and trends remained fairly consistent in the first quarter and improved compared to the same quarter last year. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 40 bp in the first quarter, compared to 44 bp last quarter and 54 bp in the first quarter of 2004. Nonperforming assets were 53 bp of total loans and leases and other real estate owned at March 31, 2005, up slightly from 51 bp last quarter and improved from the 57 bp posted a year ago. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs remains a small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. Net charge-offs were $63 million in the first quarter, compared to $71 million in the same quarter last year and $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $67 million in the first quarter compared to $87 million in the same quarter last year and $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. The loan and lease assets of First National were recorded on Fifth Third's balance sheet at their respective fair values as of January 1, 2005. Estimated credit impairment was included in this determination of fair value; therefore, the previously existing allowance for loan and lease losses did not carryover to the allowance for loan and lease losses on Fifth Third's balance sheet. Fifth Third expects credit quality trends in 2005 to remain similar to those seen in recent periods.
 
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense increased nine percent over the same quarter last year and decreased 25 percent compared to last quarter. Comparisons to prior periods are notably impacted by the following factors: the previously disclosed $247 million in charges related to the early retirement of approximately $2.8 billion of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2004 and increases across all expense captions due in part to the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National, including $7 million in acquisition related expenses, a $4 million increase in marketing costs in Florida markets and $5 million in increased intangible amortization. Increases in expenses compared to the same period last year are predominantly related to information technology expenditures and significant investments in the sales force and retail distribution network as evidenced by the increase in headcount and the corresponding increases in the employee-related and net occupancy expense captions. Compared to the same quarter last year, Fifth Third has added 132 net banking centers to the retail distribution network, non-employee information technology expenses have increased by $10 million and total full-time equivalent employees have increased by approximately 2,700, including approximately 2,300 sales personnel. Fifth Third's first quarter efficiency ratio was 51.6 percent, compared to 76.0 percent last quarter and 46.8 percent in the first quarter of last year.
