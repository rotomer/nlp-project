Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On May 20, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp ("Fifth Third") amended the Fifth Third Stock Option Gain Deferral Plan as set forth in Annex 1 hereto. The amendment to the Plan eliminates the future ability of participants in the Plan to defer receipt of shares of Fifth Third common stock upon exercise of stock options that had not yet been exercised as of the date of the amendment. The receipt of shares of Fifth Third common stock that had been previously issued upon exercise of stock options and deferred under the terms of the Plan, will continue to be deferred until paid as set forth in the Plan.
