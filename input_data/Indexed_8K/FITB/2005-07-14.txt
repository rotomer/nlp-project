Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Fifth Third Bancorp's 2005 second quarter earnings per diluted share were $.75 compared to $.79 per diluted share for the same period in 2004. Second quarter net income totaled $417 million compared to $448 million in the same quarter last year. Return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 1.63 percent and 18.1 percent, respectively, compared to 1.91 percent and 21.0 percent in 2004's second quarter. In addition to the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National Bankshares of Florida, Inc. ("First National"), second quarter earnings and balance sheet comparisons to the prior year are impacted by a previously disclosed $148 million gain on the sale of certain third party merchant contracts and a charge of $78 million related to the early retirement of debt realized in the second quarter of 2004.
"We continue to focus on increasing our revenue and net income run-rate," stated George A. Schaefer, Jr., President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "Despite the interest rate driven difficulties in our industry, we continue to be very pleased with the successes achieved in the hiring of experienced sales people and the recent stronger performance in certain businesses. Our lending businesses remain strong, credit quality trends are extremely favorable and noninterest revenues showed improvement this quarter on most fronts including excellent overall results from Fifth Third Processing Solutions. The combination of recent decreases in long-term interest rates, deposit growth trends below our expectations, and mix shifts within the deposit base to higher cost time deposits all negatively impacted our spread based revenues this quarter. This remains both our largest source of frustration and greatest opportunity for improved performance in the near term. Our efforts are firmly focused on continuing recent improvement in net account growth, offering greater value to our customers and improving our banking center and sales force distribution networks. Higher interest rates combined with good loan and deposit growth from these efforts will drive improvement in both the net interest margin and spread based revenues."
"Fifth Third has historically approached delivering shareholder value through a combination of both organic and acquisition driven growth strategies. More recently, we have been focused largely on investing in an organic growth model as demonstrated by the hiring of more than 2,400 sales people and the opening of 105 net new locations since the beginning of 2004 excluding acquisitions and relocations. The decision to heavily invest in an organic expansion of this magnitude over the past two years, which resulted at least partially from the lack of attractively priced acquisition opportunities, has been costly in its initial stages. We believe that these investments are beginning to deliver the type of returns our long-term shareholders expect from us and a continuation of these efforts remains the best path to building a high quality franchise in each of our markets.

This focus, combined with a strong capital position, diversified business mix, granular loan portfolio, and, most importantly, a proven sales culture in our affiliate bank model, position Fifth Third for improving performance as we move through the remainder of the year and into 2006."
 
Noninterest Income
Fifth Third Processing Solutions, our electronic payment processing division, delivered a 21 percent increase in revenues over the same quarter last year and a 28 percent increase on an annualized sequential basis. Second quarter results are representative of continuing strong trends from both merchant processing and financial institutions and corresponding impacts on processing volumes. Fifth Third continues to see significant opportunities to attract new retailers and financial institution customers.
Deposit service revenues rebounded strongly from first quarter levels on improved retail related service revenues. Compared to the same quarter last year, deposit service revenues were essentially unchanged with growth in the number of consumer and commercial account relationships offset by the impacts of higher interest rates on compensating balances in commercial deposit accounts.
Investment Advisory revenues decreased by six percent over the same quarter last year and increased by six percent on an annualized sequential basis. The decrease in service revenue relative to the same quarter last year resulted primarily from declines in retail brokerage related revenues. The increase in revenue compared to the first quarter resulted primarily from a broader product menu in our private client area. Fifth Third continues to focus its efforts on growing the institutional money management business by penetrating our large middle market commercial customer base with retirement and wealth planning services. Fifth Third Investment Advisors, among the largest money managers in the Midwest, has $33 billion in assets under management and $187 billion in assets under care.
Mortgage net service revenue totaled $46 million in the second quarter compared to $41 million last quarter and $61 million in 2004's second quarter. Mortgage originations totaled $2.6 billion in the second quarter versus $1.9 billion last quarter and $2.8 billion in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter mortgage banking net service revenue was comprised of $65 million in total mortgage banking fees and loan sales, plus $18 million of gains and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments and less $37 million in amortization and valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights. The mark-to-market adjustments and settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments and corresponding valuation adjustments resulted from interest rate volatility and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $368 million at June 30, 2005 on a servicing portfolio of $24.5 billion, compared to $367 million last quarter on a servicing portfolio of $23.3 billion.
Other noninterest income totaled $156 million in the second quarter, a 16 percent annualized increase from first quarter levels, primarily attributable to strong growth across numerous subcategories including cardholder fees, commercial banking revenue, customer interest rate derivative sales and consumer loan and lease fees. Comparisons to the same quarter last year are impacted by the previously disclosed $148 million gain on the sale of certain third party merchant contracts. Exclusive of the impact of this transaction, other noninterest income increased by 30 percent over the same quarter last year; a comparison being provided to supplement fundamental trends in other noninterest income. Compared to the same quarter last year, cardholder fees increased by 28 percent, commercial banking revenues increased by 21 percent, institutional fixed income trading and sales increased by 23 percent and customer interest rate derivative sales increased by 195 percent.

Balance Sheet Trends
Very strong retail and commercial account growth, mitigated by mix shifts within the deposit base and the impacts of compensating balances, resulted in mixed deposit trends in the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, average core deposit balances increased $7.8 billion, or 16 percent, highlighted by 13 percent growth in average demand deposits, 34 percent growth in average savings and money market deposits and 42 percent growth in consumer time deposits. Average interest checking deposits were largely unchanged from the same quarter last year with net account growth offset by certain high balance account attrition and balance migration to higher cost deposit products. Average transaction deposits increased by 13 percent over the same quarter last year. Deposit comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National and the second quarter 2004 acquisition of Franklin Financial Corporation. Exclusive of the impact of these transactions, average transaction account balances increased by six percent over the same quarter last year and average core deposits increased nine percent over the same quarter last year; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of the fundamental deposit trends. Compared to the first quarter of this year, average transaction account balances were essentially unchanged and average core deposits increased by four percent on an annualized basis, highlighted by 13 percent annualized growth in demand deposits and 26 percent annualized growth in consumer time deposits. Fifth Third expects deposit pricing to continue to be very competitive with market conditions and is continuing to devote significant focus on retaining existing accounts and attracting new accounts.
Loan and lease balances exhibited continued strength with period end loans and leases increasing by $1.4 billion from last quarter, or nine percent on an annualized sequential basis. On an average basis, total loans and leases, including held for sale, increased by 19 percent over the same quarter last year and by 10 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Period end commercial loan and lease balances increased by 21 percent over the same quarter last year and by $892 million, or 10 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Period end consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgage, increased by 10 percent over the same quarter last year and by $876 million, or 16 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Loan and lease comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by the addition of approximately $3.9 billion in total loans in conjunction with the acquisition of First National. Exclusive of the impact of this transaction, period end commercial loan and lease balances increased 12 percent and period end consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgage, increased eight percent over last year; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of fundamental lending trends.
 
Net Interest Income
Compared to the second quarter of 2004, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased two percent despite six percent growth in average earning assets due to a 25 basis point (bp) decline in the net interest margin. Margin and net interest income trends and comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National, including a modestly negative impact to net interest income from purchase accounting loan and deposit net amortization, common stock repurchase activity and the impact of balance sheet initiatives undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2004 to reduce the risks associated with increasing interest rates. Compared to the first quarter of 2005, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was essentially unchanged despite six percent annualized growth in average earning assets due to nine bp of contraction in the net interest margin. Margin contraction from seasonally high first quarter levels resulted from decreases in the net interest rate spread associated with the growth in earning assets relative to the growth in core

deposits, mix shifts within the deposit base to higher cost time deposits and the recent flattening of the yield curve. Fifth Third is focused on improving core deposit trends in order to fund future loan growth and improve net interest margin trends. Margin trends in 2005 will depend on the speed and timing of further short-term interest rate increases, the level of intermediate-term interest rates and the degree and mix of earning asset and deposit growth.
 
Credit Quality
Credit quality metrics and trends improved in the second quarter and remain at historically strong levels. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 34 bp in the second quarter, compared to 40 bp last quarter and 43 bp in the second quarter of 2004. Nonperforming assets were 51 bp of total loans and leases and other real estate owned at June 30, 2005, compared to 53 bp last quarter and 50 bp posted a year ago. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs remains a small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. Net charge-offs were $55 million in the second quarter, compared to $59 million in the same quarter last year and $63 million in the first quarter of 2005. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $60 million in the second quarter compared to $90 million in the same quarter last year and $67 million in the first quarter of 2005. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents 1.09 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of June 30, 2005, compared to 1.11 percent last quarter and 1.31 in the same quarter last year. Comparisons to the level of prior year allowance for loan and lease losses are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National. The loan and lease assets of First National were recorded on Fifth Third's balance sheet at their respective fair values as of January 1, 2005. Estimated credit impairment was included in this determination of fair value; therefore, the previously existing allowance for loan and lease losses did not carryover to the allowance for loan and lease losses on Fifth Third's balance sheet. Although realistic about the difficulty in precisely estimating credit quality metrics, Fifth Third expects credit quality trends in 2005 to remain strong.
 
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense increased by $23 million, or 13 percent on an annualized basis, from last quarter and decreased by $14 million, or two percent from the same quarter last year. Comparison to the prior year period is impacted by the $78 million charge related to the early retirement of approximately $1 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances in the second quarter of 2004 and $5 million in increased intangible amortization resulting from the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National. Exclusive of the impact of the debt termination charge, total noninterest expense increased by 10 percent over the same quarter last year on increased information technology expenditures and significant investments in the sales force and retail distribution network as evidenced by the increase in headcount and the corresponding increases in the employee-related and net occupancy expense captions; a comparison being provided to supplement an understanding of fundamental noninterest expense trends. Comparisons to last quarter are impacted by $7 million in acquisition related expenses realized in the first quarter of 2005. Exclusive of the impact of these expenses, noninterest expense increased 17 percent on an annualized basis primarily due to a $30 million increase in salaries, wages and incentives associated with headcount increases and approximately $8 million in severance expenses realized in the second quarter. Fifth Third expects growth in noninterest expenses in future quarters to stabilize around current levels as cost savings initiatives continue to be realized. These cost savings initiatives will be mitigated

by continued growth in headcount, occupancy and information technology to improve efficiency, provide greater convenience to our customers and drive deposit and loan growth. Fifth Third's second quarter efficiency ratio was 52.2 percent, compared to 51.6 percent last quarter and 48.8 percent in the second quarter of last year.
