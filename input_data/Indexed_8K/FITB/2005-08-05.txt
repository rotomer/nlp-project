Item 4.01.        Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountants
 
As a result of the Fifth Third Bancorp ("Fifth Third") acquisition of First National Bankshares of Florida, Inc., Fifth Third has engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP as its independent registered public accounting firm to audit the financial statements of the Southern Community Bancorp Employees' Savings and Profit Sharing Plan (the "Plan") for the year ended December 31, 2004. Hacker, Johnson & Smith PA was dismissed as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Plan on May 9, 2005. The Audit Committee of Fifth Third has approved the engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP to audit the Plan. The reports of Hacker, Johnson & Smith PA regarding the Plan's financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion or any qualification or modification as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through May 9, 2005, there have been no disagreements with Hacker, Johnson & Smith PA on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Hacker, Johnson & Smith PA, would have caused it to make reference to the matter in its reports on the Plan's 2003 and 2002 financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through May 9, 2005, there have been no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v)). Hacker, Johnson & Smith PA has been provided with a copy of the foregoing statements. Attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of Hacker, Johnson & Smith PA's letter dated August 5, 2005 stating its agreement with such statements.
 
On May 9, 2005, the Plan engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP as its independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Plan's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through the date of engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Plan did not consult with Deloitte & Touche LLP on any accounting or auditing matter.
