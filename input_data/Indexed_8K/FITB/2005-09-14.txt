Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Exhibit 99.1  Management Discussion of Trends
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Fifth Third Bancorp has developed the document attached as Exhibit 99.1 containing a general trend overview of Fifth Third's objectives, financial condition and results of operations for the third quarter of 2005.
 
 
 
Noninterest Income
 
In general, management expects noninterest income categories to perform at levels similar to recent periods with solid performance over the same quarter last year on a core basis. Specifically, by major category:
 
Electronic Payment Processing
 
Fifth Third expects third quarter electronic payment processing revenues to continue to reflect strong trends in both new customer acquisition and retail sales activity overall. Processing revenues are expected to increase at a rate approximating 20-25 percent growth over the same quarter last year.
 
Deposit Service Revenue
 
Third quarter retail and commercial deposit account service revenues are expected to increase from second quarter levels on improved retail-based deposit revenues. Commercial-based revenues continue to be impacted by rising short-term interest rates despite increased activity and numerous customer additions relative to the same quarter last year.
 
Investment Advisors
 
Fifth Third expects third quarter investment advisory revenues to produce stable to modestly improved results compared to second quarter 2005 levels on continued softness in retail brokerage related revenues.
 
Mortgage Banking
 
Third quarter net mortgage banking revenues are expected to increase modestly relative to second quarter on continued strength in originations somewhat mitigated by the impact of interest rate volatility during the quarter and the corresponding impact on prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing rights portfolio.
 
Other Noninterest Income
 
Third quarter other noninterest income is expected to show similar results to second quarter from continued strength in loan and lease fees, international income, and commercial banking sub-categories.
 
Expenses
 
Compared to the second quarter of 2005, noninterest expenses are expected to exhibit mid to high single digit percentage growth on an annualized sequential basis, highlighted by essentially unchanged employee related expenses and increases in bankcard, marketing, and information technology related expenditures.
Balance Sheet Trends
 
 
 
 
 
Credit Quality
 
Third quarter credit quality trends remain subdued with net charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans and leases, expected to remain below 40 basis points. Nonperforming assets as a percent of average loans and leases are not expected to change significantly from second quarter levels. Although realistic about the difficulty in precisely estimating credit quality metrics, Fifth Third's long history of conservative exposure limits, centralized credit risk management and a diversified portfolio positions us well to effectively weather cycles and reduce the likelihood of significant unexpected losses. As a result of expected credit trends, Fifth Third does not expect a significant change in the reserve for credit losses during the third quarter.
