Item 9.01        Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Exhibit 99.1  Press release dated October 18, 2005.
 
Exhibit 99.2  Quarterly Financial Supplement.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Fifth Third Bancorp's 2005 third quarter earnings per diluted share were $.71 compared to $.83 per diluted share for the same period in 2004. Third quarter net income totaled $395 million compared to $471 million in the same quarter last year. Return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 1.51 percent and 16.6 percent, respectively, compared to 1.95 percent and 21.1 percent in 2004's third quarter. Third quarter earnings and balance sheet comparisons to the prior year are impacted by the previously disclosed first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National Bankshares of Florida, Inc. (First National). Third quarter 2004 earnings were positively impacted by a $27 million decrease in the reserve for credit losses and the corresponding decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses.
"Revenue and net income trends remain below our expectations," stated George A. Schaefer, Jr., President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "Deposit growth year to date has not been sufficient to fund loan growth or to prevent further contraction in the net interest margin. This factor mitigated very strong lending results, well behaved credit trends and excellent results from Fifth Third Processing Solutions and our commercial line of business. To improve results, we have aggressively increased deposit rates, despite the negative impact on the third quarter margin, to deliver greater value to new and existing customers. We believe competitive rates combined with enhanced product offerings, like our new identity theft solution, will result in better deposit performance than we have seen through the first nine months of this year. Our goal remains improving our funding mix to more effectively fund future loan growth. We are also carefully reviewing all expense categories given the difficulty of the environment and current revenue trends."
"The continued flattening of the yield curve provides substantial challenges by limiting investment opportunities and returns. The financial services business periodically faces challenges such as these and I believe long-term performance is determined by how you respond in times of difficulty. Despite short-term pressures, Fifth Third remains committed to our unique affiliate bank model and is focused on a long-term view with an emphasis on returns on invested capital. Today, this means we will continue to make the appropriate de-novo investments to drive profitable growth in each of our markets as the most effective method to deliver returns to our shareholders. We will also continue to maintain appropriate capital levels while working to achieve the benefits of scale that increased automation can deliver."
"In September, Fifth Third's Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on its common shares to $.38 per share, an increase of 19 percent over the $.32 per share declared in September 2004 and a nine percent increase over the $.35 per share declared in June 2005. This quarter's dividend surpasses our level of current earnings growth but illustrates the importance we place on delivering value to our shareholders and the confidence
we have in returning to better growth and profitability. On behalf of our management team and 23,000 employees, we thank our shareholders for their continued confidence and look forward to delivering better results."
 
Noninterest Income
Recent improved performance in certain business line revenue segments continued in the third quarter of 2005. Overall noninterest income, excluding operating lease revenues and securities gains, increased by eight percent over the same quarter last year.
Fifth Third Processing Solutions, our electronic payment processing division, delivered a 23 percent increase in revenues over the same quarter last year and a 15 percent increase on an annualized sequential basis. Third quarter results are representative of continuing strong trends in merchant processing and financial institution volumes and corresponding impacts on processing volumes. Fifth Third continues to see significant opportunities to attract new retailers and financial institution customers.
Deposit service revenues increased 16 percent on an annualized sequential basis due to strong growth in net new consumer deposit account production. Net new consumer deposit account production increased by 17 percent unannualized in the third quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, deposit service revenues increased by two percent highlighted by five percent growth in retail deposit revenues. Commercial deposit revenues declined modestly compared to the same quarter last year with growth in the number of relationships offset by the impacts of higher interest rates on compensating balances in commercial deposit accounts.
Investment Advisory revenues were essentially unchanged compared to the same quarter last year and decreased by nine percent on an annualized sequential basis from last quarter. The decrease in revenue compared to the second quarter resulted primarily from declines in retail brokerage related revenues. Fifth Third continues to focus its efforts on improving execution in retail brokerage and growing the institutional money management business by improving penetration and cross-sell in our large middle market commercial customer base. Fifth Third Investment Advisors, among the largest money managers in the Midwest, has $33 billion in assets under management and $189 billion in assets under care.
Mortgage net service revenue totaled $45 million in the third quarter compared to $46 million last quarter and $49 million in 2004's third quarter. Mortgage originations totaled $2.9 billion in the third quarter versus $2.6 billion last quarter and $1.7 billion in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter mortgage banking net service revenue was comprised of $61 million in total mortgage banking fees and loan sales, plus $6 million in amortization and valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights and less $22 million of losses and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments. The mark-to-market adjustments and settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments and corresponding valuation adjustments resulted from interest rate volatility and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $408 million at September 30, 2005 on a servicing portfolio of $24.5 billion, compared to $368 million last quarter on a servicing portfolio of $24.5 billion.
Other noninterest income totaled $145 million in the third quarter compared to $156 million last quarter and $137 million in the year ago third quarter. Compared to the same period last year, other noninterest income increased six percent primarily due to strong growth in commercial banking revenues, customer interest rate derivative sales, bank owned life insurance and cardholder fees. The decrease in other noninterest income relative to last quarter is primarily attributable to declines in consumer lending fees and institutional bond sales and underwriting.
 
Balance Sheet Trends
Average transaction deposits increased by eight percent over the same quarter last year with good retail and commercial account growth mitigated by certain high balance account attrition and balance migration to higher cost deposit products. Compared to the same quarter last year, average core deposit balances increased $5.9 billion, or 12 percent, highlighted by 11 percent growth in average demand deposits, 28 percent growth in average savings and money market deposits and 34 percent growth in consumer time deposits. These results were mitigated by a $1.1 billion decrease, or five percent, in average interest checking deposits from the same quarter last year. Deposit comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National. Exclusive of the impact of this transaction, average transaction account balances increased by three percent over the same quarter last year and average core deposits increased five percent over the same quarter last year; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of the fundamental deposit trends. Compared to the second quarter of this year, average transaction account balances were essentially unchanged despite 20 percent unannualized growth in the number of consumer deposit accounts opened during the third quarter. Average core deposits increased by three percent on an annualized basis, highlighted by 33 percent annualized growth in money market deposits and 21 percent annualized growth in consumer time deposits.
Loan and lease balances exhibited continued strength across Fifth Third's footprint with period end loans and leases increasing by a very strong $2.5 billion from last quarter, or 15 percent on an annualized sequential basis. On an average basis, total loans and leases, including held for sale, increased by 19 percent over the same quarter last year and by 11 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Period end commercial loan and lease balances increased by 23 percent over the same quarter last year and by $1.0 billion, or 11 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Period end consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgage, increased by 14 percent over the same quarter last year and by $1.1 billion, or 20 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Loan and lease comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by the addition of approximately $3.9 billion in total loans in conjunction with the acquisition of First National. Exclusive of the impact of this transaction, period end commercial loan and lease balances increased 13 percent and period end consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgage, increased 12 percent over last year; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of fundamental lending trends.
Fifth Third repurchased approximately 2.3 million common shares in the third quarter of 2005. As of September 30, 2005, the remaining authority under the plan authorized by the Board of Directors in January of 2005 is 17.8 million shares. All counterparty purchase activity associated with the previously announced overnight accelerated share repurchase transaction, providing for the repurchase of 35.5 million common shares, was completed in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Net Interest Income
Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased three percent over the same quarter last year and seven percent on an annualized basis from last quarter. Third quarter margin compression largely resulted from aggressive increases in deposit pricing combined with lower than expected growth in balances. Fifth Third remains optimistic that core deposit trends will improve in the fourth quarter from year-to-date 2005 run rates and that recent aggressive pricing and marketing initiatives will improve the funding mix, more effectively fund future loan growth and improve net interest margin trends.
 
Compared to the third quarter of 2004, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased three percent despite five percent growth in average earning assets due to a 26 basis point (bp) decline in the net interest margin. Margin, net interest income and earning asset trends and comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National, including a modestly negative impact to net interest income from purchase accounting loan and deposit net amortization, common stock repurchase activity and the impact of sales and cash flows in the reduction of the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Including balance sheet initiatives undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2004, available-for-sale securities have declined by $9 billion, or 29 percent, from the same quarter last year.
Compared to the second quarter of 2005, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased by $13 million, or seven percent annualized, due to modest growth in average earning assets and 13 bp of contraction in the net interest margin. Margin contraction resulted from decreases in the net interest rate spread associated with continued mix shifts within the deposit base to higher cost time deposits, increases in rates paid across deposit captions and the continued flattening of the yield curve. Third quarter earning asset growth was muted by efforts to reduce the risks associated with increasing interest rates given weaker than anticipated core deposit growth trends. This included the maintenance of strong capital levels through reductions in the available-for-sale securities portfolio totaling $908 million on an average basis and $2.1 billion on a period end basis from second quarter levels.
 
Credit Quality
Credit quality metrics and trends remained stable at historically low levels in the third quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 38 bp in the third quarter, compared to 34 bp last quarter and 40 bp in the third quarter of 2004. Nonperforming assets were 51 bp of total loans and leases and other real estate owned at September 30, 2005, compared to 51 bp last quarter and 48 bp posted in the year ago third quarter. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs remains a small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. Net charge-offs were $64 million in the third quarter, compared to $57 million in the same quarter last year and $55 million in the second quarter of 2005. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $69 million in the third quarter compared to $26 million in the same quarter last year and $60 million in the second quarter of 2005. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents 1.06 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of September 30, 2005, compared to 1.09 percent last quarter and 1.23 percent in the same quarter last year. Comparisons to the level of prior year allowance for loan and lease losses are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National. The loan and lease assets of First National were recorded on Fifth Third's balance sheet at their respective fair values as of January 1, 2005. Estimated credit impairment was included in this determination of fair value; therefore, the previously existing allowance for loan and lease losses did not carryover to the allowance for loan and lease losses on Fifth Third's balance sheet.
 
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense moderated considerably from recent trends and increased by $4 million from the second quarter of 2005. Increases in marketing, information technology and bankcard volume related costs were mitigated by reductions in total personnel related expenditures. Fifth Third expects growth in noninterest expenses in future quarters to stabilize around current levels with management focus in light of current revenue trends. Cost savings initiatives will be somewhat mitigated by continued growth in the sales force, occupancy and information technology to improve efficiency, provide greater convenience to our customers and drive
 
deposit and loan growth. Compared to the same quarter last year, total noninterest expense increased by $84 million, or 13 percent, due to the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National, increased information technology expenditures and significant investments in the sales force and retail distribution network. Fifth Third's third quarter efficiency ratio was 53.5 percent, compared to 52.2 percent last quarter and 47.0 percent in the third quarter of last year.
