On November 4, 2005, Fifth Third amended the Old Kent Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan. The changes in the plan were mostly designed to comply with the enactment of new Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
 
As permitted by the new legislation, the amendment provides participants a one-time election to either take a complete taxable payout in 2005, or, in the alternative, to have their benefit deferred and administered under the Fifth Third Bancorp Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, as amended and restated.
 
This description of the amended plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amendment itself, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
Exhibit 10.1  2005-1 Amendment to Old Kent Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

EXHIBIT 10.1
 
 
 
WHEREAS, Fifth Third Financial Corporation, as successor to Old Kent Financial Corporation, maintains the Old Kent Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan;
 
WHEREAS, section 8.1 of the Old Kent Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan reserves to the Fifth Third Financial Corporation the power to amend the plan;
 
WHEREAS, Fifth Third Financial Corporation would like to amend the plan and to provide for its complete amendment and restatement into the Fifth Third Bancorp Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the reserved power of amendment contained in section 8.1 of the Old Kent Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan, the Plan is hereby amended in the following respects:
 
 
As such, the plan document (and any future amendments) comprising the Fifth Third Bancorp Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors shall be controlling with respect to benefits attributable to the Old Kent Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan; provided, however, prior to such date in 2005 as determined by the Administrator, the Old Kent Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan may be administered based on the provisions of the plan document and amendments comprising such plan, as they existed prior to this amendment and restatement, to the extent consistent with Internal Revenue Code section 409A. Otherwise such plan document and amendments shall have no further force and effect.
 
The Old Kent Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan shall constitute a "Predecessor Plan" as defined in the Fifth Third Bancorp Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.
 
Specifically, but without limitation, the Administrator, in its discretion, may condition the ability of a Participant to receive a complete payout of his account in 2005, on the Participant consenting to Fifth Third Financial Corporation's amendment of the Old Kent Executive Benefit Trust and removal of Wachovia Bank, N.A. as trustee.
 
 
 
 
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Fifth Third Financial Corporation has caused this amendment to be adopted this 4th day of November, 2005.
 
Fifth Third Financial Corporation
