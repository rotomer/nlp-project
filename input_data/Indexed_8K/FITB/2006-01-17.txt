HAND DELIVERED
 
R. Mark Graf
 
Dear Mark:
 
This letter will serve as an amendment to the Letter Agreement dated September 26, 2005 (the "Letter Agreement") that addresses the terms of your resignation from Fifth Third Bank ("Bank").
 
Paragraph 1 of the agreements that R. Mark Graf ("you") set forth in the Letter Agreement is hereby amended and restated in full as follows:
 
 
In all other respects the Letter Agreement will remain in full force and effect as originally written.
 
Please acknowledge your understanding and acceptance of this letter by signing and dating where indicated below.
 
 
 
I have read, understand and agree to the terms of this letter.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
Fifth Third Bancorp's 2005 fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were $.60 compared to $.31 per diluted share for the same period in 2004. Fourth quarter net income totaled $332 million compared to $176 million in the same quarter last year. Return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 1.27 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively, compared to 0.72 percent and 7.6 percent in 2004's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share for the full year 2005 were $2.77, an increase of three percent over last year's earnings of $2.68. ROA for the full year 2005 was 1.50 percent and ROE was 16.6 percent, compared to 1.61 percent and 17.2 percent, respectively, in 2004. Fourth quarter and full year 2004 earnings were negatively impacted by $326 million in total pre-tax ($208 million after-tax) termination charges and securities losses, or $.37 per diluted share, related to balance sheet initiatives undertaken to reduce leverage and improve our interest rate profile for expected market conditions. Earnings and balance sheet comparisons to the prior year are also impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National Bankshares of Florida, Inc. (First National).
 
"Revenue and net income trends were significantly below our expectations entering the year," stated George A. Schaefer, Jr., President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "Although loan growth remained strong in 2005, disappointing deposit growth in the first half of the year combined with significant flattening of the yield curve throughout the year provided a challenging environment for Fifth Third. The resulting declines in returns from the securities portfolio have more than offset growth generated from core banking activities this year with spread based revenues, the largest component of our income statement, remaining essentially unchanged from the prior year. Efforts to reduce the level of securities and wholesale funding on the balance sheet began in late 2004 and continued throughout 2005. While restraining balance sheet growth negatively impacts short-term earnings and comparisons to prior periods, we believe that these actions will improve the risk profile of the balance sheet and deliver more consistent returns on invested capital over the long-term. In the short term, we continue to focus on all expense categories given the difficulty of the interest rate environment. While maintaining an appropriate level of investment in our high opportunity markets remains vital to our long-term success, we believe that 2006 will provide opportunities to optimize returns on recent investments and improve expense efficiency in light of current revenue trends."
 
"Despite the difficulties encountered this year and their impacts on the performance of our stock, I feel that we have accomplished many things to improve our competitive position and drive revenue and earnings growth in the years to come. We are extremely proud of the efforts of our employees in producing very strong lending
results, renewed strength in deposit growth and the strong overall results from Fifth Third Processing Solutions and our commercial line of business. In addition to these core strengths, Fifth Third added numerous new banking center locations in 2005 in extremely attractive deposit markets, meaningfully expanded our sales force and accomplished numerous infrastructure improvements that we believe have improved the earnings potential, efficiency and strength of your company."
 
Balance Sheet Trends
 
Retail transaction account growth and commercial customer additions resulted in strong deposit trends in the second half of 2005. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, average transaction account balances increased by $3.8 billion, or eight percent, highlighted by strong growth in average savings and money market deposits. Compared to the third quarter of 2005, average transaction account balances increased by $1.4 billion, or 11 percent on an annualized sequential basis. On a full year average basis, total transaction deposits increased by $4.8 billion, or 11 percent, over last year. Including consumer time deposits, total core deposits increased by 12 percent over the same quarter last year and 13 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Deposit comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National. Exclusive of the impact of this transaction, average transaction account balances increased by five percent on a full year basis and average core deposits increased eight percent on the same basis (comparisons are being provided to supplement an understanding of the fundamental deposit trends).
 
Loan and lease balances exhibited continued strength with average loans and leases increasing by $1.9 billion from last quarter, or 11 percent on an annualized sequential basis, and by 19 percent on a full year average basis. On a period end basis, total loans and leases increased by 18 percent over the same quarter last year and by seven percent on an annualized sequential basis. Period end commercial loan and lease balances increased by 22 percent over the same quarter last year and by $1.3 billion, or 14 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Period end consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgage, increased by 14 percent over the same quarter last year and by three percent on an annualized sequential basis. Loan and lease comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by the addition of approximately $3.9 billion in total loans in conjunction with the acquisition of First National. Exclusive of the impact of this transaction, period end commercial loan and lease balances increased by 14 percent and period end consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgage, increased by 12 percent over last year (comparisons are being provided to supplement an understanding of fundamental lending trends).
 
Net Interest Income
 
Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased two percent on a full year basis due to 25 basis points (bp) of contraction in the net interest margin. Margin compression during 2005 largely resulted from decreases in the net interest rate spread associated with increases in rates paid across deposit and other funding categories, continued mix shifts within the deposit base to higher cost time deposits and the prolonged and significant flattening of the yield curve throughout the year. Fifth Third is focused on growing core deposit balances and remains optimistic that recent trend improvement will continue in 2006 in order to improve the funding mix, more effectively fund future loan growth and improve net interest margin trends.
 
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2004, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased two percent, despite five percent growth in average earning assets, due to a 24 bp decline in the net interest margin. Earning asset growth relative to the fourth quarter of 2004 has been muted due to a reduction of $6.3 billion in the average available-for-sale securities portfolio. In addition to the resulting impact from a decreasing
 
net interest rate spread and the flattening yield curve, margin, net interest income and earning asset trends and comparisons to prior year periods are impacted by common stock repurchase activity, the impact of sales and cash flows in the reduction of the available-for-sale securities portfolio and the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National, including a modestly negative impact to net interest income from purchase accounting loan and deposit net amortization.
 
Compared to the third quarter of 2005, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased by $10 million, or five percent annualized, due to modest growth in average earning assets and 5 bp of contraction in the net interest margin. Fourth quarter earning asset growth was muted by efforts to reduce the risks associated with increasing short-term interest rates including the maintenance of strong capital levels through reductions in the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Due to the timing of sale activities at the end of the third quarter, the available-for-sale securities portfolio decreased approximately $1.7 billion on an average basis and $460 million on a period end basis from third quarter levels.
 
Noninterest Income
 
Improved performance in certain business line revenue segments resulted in good noninterest income performance in the fourth quarter of 2005. Overall noninterest income, excluding operating lease revenues and securities gains and losses, increased by 18 percent over the same quarter last year and 16 percent on an annualized sequential basis.
 
Fifth Third Processing Solutions, our electronic payment processing division, delivered a 16 percent increase in revenues over the same quarter last year and an 18 percent increase on a full year basis. Full year revenue comparisons are impacted by the second quarter 2004 sale of certain small merchant processing contracts. Exclusive of the impact of this transaction, electronic payment processing revenue increased 23 percent on a full year basis (comparisons are being provided to supplement an understanding of fundamental revenue trends). Fourth quarter trends are representative of continuing momentum in attracting new customer relationships and moderated by slower growth in the level of retail sales transaction volumes in the fourth quarter of 2005. Fifth Third remains confident in the near and intermediate term growth outlook in this business and continues to see significant opportunities to attract new financial institution customers and retailers.
 
Sales of retail deposit accounts and corporate treasury management products led to an increase in deposit service revenues of six percent over the same quarter last year and one percent on a full year basis. Retail deposit revenues strengthened in the latter half of 2005 and increased by seven percent over the same quarter last year and three percent on a full year basis. Commercial deposit revenues increased by three percent over the same quarter last year and were essentially unchanged on a full year basis with good growth in the number of relationships mitigated by the impacts of higher interest rates on compensating balances in commercial deposit accounts. Compared to the third quarter of 2005, deposit service revenues declined modestly primarily due to a decrease in consumer overdraft related revenues.
 
Investment Advisory revenues increased by five percent over the same quarter last year and were essentially unchanged on a full year basis. Modest revenue in 2005 resulted primarily from declines in brokerage related revenues. Fifth Third continues to focus its efforts on improving execution in retail brokerage and growing the institutional money management business by improving penetration and cross-sell in our large middle market commercial customer base. Fifth Third Investment Advisors, among the largest money managers in the Midwest, has $33 billion in assets under management and $196 billion in assets under care.
 
Mortgage net service revenue totaled $42 million in the fourth quarter and $174 million on a full year basis compared to $24 million in 2004's fourth quarter and $178 million in all of 2004. Mortgage originations remained strong and totaled $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter versus $2.9 billion last quarter and $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter mortgage banking net service revenue was comprised of $65 million in total mortgage banking fees and loan sales, less $13 million in amortization and valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights and less $10 million of losses and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments. The mark-to-market adjustments and settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments and corresponding valuation adjustments resulted from interest rate volatility and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $433 million at December 31, 2005 on a servicing portfolio of $25.7 billion, compared to $408 million last quarter on a servicing portfolio of $24.5 billion.
 
Other noninterest income totaled $165 million in the fourth quarter and $620 million on a full year basis, compared to $125 million in the same quarter last year and $671 million for all of 2004. Comparison of full year results are impacted by a 2004 total pre-tax gain of approximately $157 million on the second and third quarter sales of certain third-party sourced merchant processing contracts. Exclusive of the impact of this transaction, other noninterest income increased by 20 percent on a full year basis primarily due to strong growth in commercial banking revenues, customer interest rate derivative sales, bank owned life insurance and cardholder fees; comparisons being provided to supplement an understanding of fundamental revenue trends. Compared to the third quarter of 2005, other noninterest income increased by $20 million due to very strong growth in commercial banking revenues and customer interest rate derivative sales.
 
Credit Quality
 
Fourth quarter credit quality trends reflect an elevated level of net charge-offs associated with approximately $27 million in previously announced losses to bankrupt commercial airline carriers and an increase in consumer loan and lease losses associated with increased personal bankruptcies prior to the recently enacted reform legislation. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 67 bp in the fourth quarter, compared to 38 bp last quarter and 44 bp in the fourth quarter of 2004. Nonperforming assets were 52 bp of total loans and leases and other real estate owned at December 31, 2005, compared to 51 bp last quarter and in the year ago fourth quarter. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs remains a small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. Net charge-offs were $117 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $65 million in the same quarter last year and $64 million in the third quarter of 2005. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $134 million in the fourth quarter compared to $65 million in the same quarter last year and $69 million in the third quarter of 2005. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents 1.06 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2005, compared to 1.06 percent last quarter and 1.19 percent in the same quarter last year. Comparisons to the level of prior year allowance for loan and lease losses are impacted by the first quarter 2005 acquisition of First National. The loan and lease assets of First National were recorded on Fifth Third's balance sheet at their respective fair values as of January 1, 2005. Estimated credit impairment was included in this determination of fair value; therefore, the previously existing allowance for loan and lease losses did not carryover to the allowance for loan and lease losses on Fifth Third's balance sheet.
 
Noninterest Expense
 
Total noninterest expense decreased by 18 percent compared to the same quarter last year and by two percent on a full year basis. Comparisons to prior periods are impacted by the previously disclosed $247 million
 
charge related to the early retirement of approximately $2.8 billion of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2004 and a $78 million charge related to the early retirement of approximately $1 billion of long-term debt in the second quarter of 2004. Exclusive of the impact of these termination charges, total noninterest expense increased by 11 percent in both the fourth quarter and on a full year basis primarily due to increases in sales force headcount, information technology and occupancy expenditures related to the addition of 63 de-novo banking centers in 2005 that did not involve relocation. Compared to the third quarter of 2005, total noninterest expense increased by $31 million due to growth in volume related bankcard expenditures, approximately $9 million in fraud related expenses and approximately $10 million in tax related expense.
 
Fifth Third expects growth in noninterest expenses in 2006 to be modest with continued management focus in light of current revenue trends. Cost savings initiatives will be somewhat mitigated by continuing investment in certain high opportunity markets, including the expected addition of approximately 50 net new banking centers throughout the year, in order to provide greater convenience to our customers and drive deposit and loan growth. Fifth Third's efficiency ratio was 55.6 percent in the fourth quarter and 53.2 percent on a full year basis compared to 76.0 percent and 53.9 percent in the same periods last year.
