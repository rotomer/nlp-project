Item 9.01
Financial Statements and Exhibits
Exhibit 99.1  Management Discussion of Trends
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Fifth Third Bancorp has developed the document attached as Exhibit 99.1 containing a general trend overview of Fifth Third's objectives, financial condition and results of operations for the first quarter of 2006.
Fifth Third expects first quarter 2006 trends to be mixed. Good loan growth and improved net interest margin, expense and credit trends are expected to be mitigated by more modest trends in noninterest income.
Noninterest Income
In general, management expects noninterest income to reflect modest growth on an overall basis from the same quarter last year and seasonal weakness relative to the fourth quarter of 2005. Specifically, by major category:
Electronic Payment Processing
Fifth Third expects first quarter electronic payment processing revenues to continue to reflect steady trends in both new customer acquisition and overall retail sales activity. Processing revenues are expected to exhibit mid teen percentage growth over the same quarter last year. Comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2005 are impacted by the significant seasonal increases in transaction volumes typically seen in the fourth quarter.
Deposit Service Revenue
Total first quarter deposit account service revenues are expected to increase at a mid- to high- single digit percentage rate over the same quarter last year on growth from both retail- and commercial-based deposit revenues. Commercial-based revenues continue to be impacted by rising short-term interest rates despite increased activity and numerous customer additions relative to the same quarter last year.
Investment Advisors
Fifth Third expects first quarter investment advisory revenues to produce low single digit percentage growth over the same quarter last year and solid growth from fourth quarter 2005 levels.
Mortgage Banking
First quarter net mortgage banking revenues are expected to produce stable results compared to recent trends.
Other Noninterest Income Categories
First quarter other noninterest income is expected to to exhibit modest growth over the same quarter last year exclusive of securities gains and operating lease revenue in the prior year period. Results relative to the fourth quarter are expected to be more modest due to seasonality factors and more difficult comparisons to extremely strong results from commercial banking subcategories in the prior period.
Expenses
Compared to the first quarter of 2005, noninterest expenses are expected to exhibit mid single digit percentage growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, noninterest expense captions are expected to improve significantly with seasonal increases in employee benefit related expenses more than mitigated by improvement in other expense captions.
Balance Sheet Trends
 
 
 
Credit Quality
First quarter credit quality trends are expected to show significant improvement from fourth quarter 2005 levels. Net charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans and leases, are expected to return to the mid 40 basis point level. Although realistic about the difficulty in precisely estimating credit quality metrics, Fifth Third's long history of conservative exposure limits, centralized credit risk management and a diversified portfolio positions us well to effectively weather cycles and reduce the likelihood of significant unexpected losses. Fifth Third does not expect a significant change in the reserve for credit losses as a percentage of total loans and leases during the first quarter.
