Exhibit 99.1
 
Fifth Third Bancorp's 2006 first quarter earnings per diluted share were $.65 compared to $.60 in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $.72 per diluted share for the same period in 2005. First quarter net income totaled $363 million compared to $332 million last quarter and $405 million in the same quarter last year. Return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 1.41 percent and 15.3 percent, respectively, compared to 1.62 percent and 18.0 percent in 2005's first quarter.
"We are pleased with first quarter trends in deposits, loans, fee income and expenses. They illustrate the strength of our sales force and affiliate model," stated George A. Schaefer, Jr., President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "Strong lending results, respectable deposit growth, well-behaved credit trends and excellent results from some of our fee businesses have not been enough to overcome the performance in spread-based revenues. The spread realized from the level of wholesale funding and fixed-rate securities on our balance sheet in prior years has resulted in margin compression and a considerable growth challenge for Fifth Third as short- and long-term interest rates have converged. As a result, earnings per share have decreased 10 percent compared to a year ago. As we look forward, however, we believe these pressures should lessen considerably. Loan growth and repricing remains strong, core noninterest revenue growth is solid, expenses are better controlled and funding costs should level off with interest rate tightening appearing to be nearing an end. A continuation of core trends similar to this quarter should result in a stable margin and improving bottom line performance as we move through 2006 and effectively position Fifth Third to deliver strong performance in 2007 as the margin normalizes."
"Fifth Third's focus for the remainder of 2006 will be on continuing to drive deposit growth and market share improvement, maintaining growth in high-quality consumer and commercial loans, enhancing and growing our fee businesses and controlling expenses. I believe that sustained performance in these areas will once again result in value creation for shareholders. The competitive strength of Fifth Third's employees, demonstrated even in difficult years, combined with an expanded infrastructure make me extremely optimistic about the future. On behalf of our management team, employees and board members, we thank our shareholders for their continued confidence."

Balance Sheet Trends
Retail transaction account growth and commercial customer additions resulted in good overall deposit trends in the first quarter of 2006. Compared to the first quarter last year, average core deposit balances increased by $3.3 billion, or six percent, and average transaction account balances increased by $1.4 billion, or three percent. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, average core deposit balances increased by four percent on an annualized basis and average transaction account balances were essentially unchanged despite the significant seasonal increases in commercial deposits typically seen in the fourth quarter. Fifth Third is continuing to devote significant focus on attracting new deposit accounts and retaining existing accounts in order to fund loan growth.
Loan and lease balances exhibited continued strength with average loans and leases increasing by $6.6 billion, or 10 percent, over first quarter last year and by $1.1 billion, or seven percent on an annualized sequential basis. Average commercial loan and lease balances increased by 12 percent over the same quarter last year and by $1.1 billion, or 11 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Average consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgage, increased by 12 percent over the same quarter last year and three percent on an annualized sequential basis despite reductions in the consumer lease portfolio and slowing growth in home equity balances.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased five percent, despite four percent growth in average earning assets, due to a 30 bp decline in the net interest margin compared to the first quarter of 2005. Margin compression resulted primarily from the prolonged and significant flattening of the yield curve, decreases in the net interest rate spread associated with increases in rates paid across deposit and other funding categories and continued mix shifts within the deposit base to higher cost time deposits. Earning asset growth trends relative to the same quarter last year have been muted, despite strong loan growth, by a $3.2 billion reduction in the average available-for-sale securities portfolio. Fifth Third is focused on maintaining recent strong loan growth trends and growing core deposit balances in order to improve the funding mix, more effectively fund future loan growth and improve net interest margin trends.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased by $17 million, or nine percent annualized, due to modest growth in average earning assets, day count and 3 bp of contraction in the net interest margin. Based on the forward interest rate curve and a continuation of recent balance sheet trends, Fifth Third currently expects modest margin compression in the second quarter with improving trends later in 2006.
Noninterest Income
Improved performance in certain business line revenue categories resulted in good noninterest income performance in the first quarter of 2006. Overall, noninterest income, excluding operating lease revenues and securities gains and losses, increased by six percent over the same quarter last year. Compared to last quarter, total noninterest income decreased by $19 million due primarily to seasonal factors.
Electronic payment processing revenues increased 15 percent over the same quarter last year. First quarter trends are representative of continuing momentum in attracting new customer relationships moderated by

slower growth in the level of retail sales transaction volumes. Comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2005 are impacted by the significant seasonal increases in transaction volumes typically seen in the fourth quarter. Fifth Third remains confident in the near and intermediate term growth outlook in this business and continues to see significant opportunities to attract new financial institution customers and retailers.
Sales of retail deposit accounts and corporate treasury management products led to an increase in deposit service revenues of four percent over the same quarter last year. Retail deposit revenue trends continue to improve and increased by five percent over the same quarter last year largely due to growth in the number of deposit accounts. Commercial deposit revenues increased by three percent over the same quarter last year with strong growth in relationships mitigated by the impact of higher interest rates on compensating balances in commercial deposit accounts. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, deposit revenues decreased by $7 million due to seasonal factors associated with retail deposit revenues.
Mortgage net service revenue totaled $47 million in the first quarter compared to $41 million in the same quarter last year. Mortgage originations remained strong and totaled $2.2 billion in the first quarter versus $2.5 billion last quarter and $1.9 billion in the first quarter of last year. First quarter mortgage banking net service revenue was comprised of $21 million in total origination fees and loan sales and $26 million in net servicing revenue. Net servicing revenue was comprised of $30 million of gross servicing fees, less $15 million in amortization and plus $11 million of net valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights and losses and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments to hedge mortgage servicing rights. The mark-to-market adjustments and settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments and corresponding valuation adjustments resulted from interest rate volatility and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $462 million at March 31, 2006 on a servicing portfolio of $26.4 billion, compared to $433 million last quarter on a servicing portfolio of $25.7 billion.
Corporate banking revenue totaled $76 million in the first quarter this year, an increase of 23 percent over the $62 million delivered in the same quarter last year. Strong growth over the same quarter last year was broad-based highlighted by increases in loan and lease related fees, customer interest rate derivative sales and international revenues. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, corporate banking revenue decreased $16 million due to very strong fourth quarter results in loan and lease related fees and customer interest rate derivative sales.
Investment advisory revenues increased modestly compared to the same quarter last year and increased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter resulted primarily from seasonal strength in retail brokerage and personal trust. Fifth Third continues to focus its efforts on improving execution in retail brokerage and growing the institutional money management business by improving penetration and cross-sell in our large middle market commercial customer base. Fifth Third Investment Advisors, among the largest money managers in the Midwest, has $33 billion in assets under management and $203 billion in assets under care.
Other noninterest income totaled $80 million in the first quarter, compared to $77 million last quarter and $108 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease in revenue relative to first quarter 2005 resulted primarily from continued runoff in the operating lease portfolio and declines in several other subcategories including consumer loan and lease fees, bank owned life insurance and student loan sales.

Credit Quality
First quarter credit quality trends improved significantly from fourth quarter 2005 levels. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 42 bp in the first quarter, compared to 67 bp last quarter and 40 bp in the first quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs were $73 million in the first quarter, compared to $63 million in the same quarter last year and $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Fourth quarter 2005 net charge-offs included approximately $27 million in losses to bankrupt commercial airline carriers and an approximate $15 million increase in consumer loan and lease losses associated with increased personal bankruptcies declared prior to the recently enacted reform legislation. Nonperforming assets were 51 bp of total loans and leases and other real estate owned at March 31, 2006, compared to 52 bp last quarter and 53 bp in the year ago first quarter. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs remains a small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $78 million in the first quarter compared to $67 million in the same quarter last year and $134 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents 1.05 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of March 31, 2006, compared to 1.06 percent last quarter and 1.11 percent in the same quarter last year.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense increased by four percent over the same quarter last year and decreased by 17 percent annualized from fourth quarter 2005 levels. The increase in expenses compared to the same quarter last year was primarily due to increases in sales force headcount and occupancy expenditures related to the addition of de-novo banking centers. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, total noninterest expense decreased by $32 million. First quarter expense trends were controlled overall with comparisons to last quarter impacted by a significant seasonal increase in employee benefit related expenses in the first quarter, reductions in volume related bankcard expenditures and approximately $19 million in previously disclosed fourth quarter 2005 fraud and tax-related expenses.
Fifth Third expects growth in noninterest expenses in 2006 to continue to be modest with management focus in light of current revenue trends. Cost savings initiatives will be somewhat mitigated by continuing investment in certain high opportunity markets, including the expected addition of approximately 50 net new banking centers in 2006, in order to provide greater convenience to our customers and drive deposit and loan growth. Fifth Third's efficiency ratio was 54.7 percent in the first quarter compared to 55.6 percent last quarter and 51.6 percent in the first quarter of 2005.
