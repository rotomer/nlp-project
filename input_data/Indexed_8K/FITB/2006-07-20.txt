Exhibit 99.1
 
Fifth Third Bancorp's second quarter 2006 earnings per diluted share were $.69 compared to $.65 in the first quarter of 2006 and $.75 per diluted share for the same period in 2005. Second quarter net income totaled $382 million compared to $363 million last quarter and $417 million in the same quarter last year. Return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE) were 1.45 percent and 16.0 percent, respectively, compared to 1.63 percent and 18.1 percent in 2005's second quarter.
"Second quarter trends in deposits, loans, fee income and credit quality reflect both an improving bottom line and outlook for the future," stated George A. Schaefer, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "Our primary challenge, and focus for further improvement, lies in continuing to stabilize and improve the net interest margin. Over the last year and a half, we have maintained a disciplined, long-term balance sheet approach and have remained committed to not increasing leverage as short- and long-term interest rates have converged. With interest rate tightening appearing to be nearing an end and deposit trends showing positive momentum, significant potential exists to improve the net interest margin and drive positive operating leverage over the years to come. Fifth Third's deposit and funding costs are competitive with market conditions and loan repricing into a higher rate environment remains strong. The employees of Fifth Third have demonstrated poise and perseverance during a difficult two years and I am very proud of their efforts to better serve our existing customers while continuing to maintain our historically strong track record of adding new customers. Through their hard work, I believe Fifth Third is positioned to improve shareholder returns by having taken the difficult, but necessary actions to reduce interest rate risk and ensure that consistently strong core banking performance reaches the bottom line."
"In June, Fifth Third's Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on its common shares to $.40 per share, an increase of 14 percent over the $.35 per share declared in June 2005 and a five percent increase over the $.38 per share declared in March 2006. This quarter's dividend surpasses our level of current earnings growth but illustrates the importance we place on delivering value to our shareholders and the confidence we have in returning to better growth and profitability. On behalf of our management team and 22,000 employees, we thank our shareholders for their continued confidence and look forward to continuing to deliver improving performance."

Noninterest Income
Improved performance in certain business line revenue categories resulted in good noninterest income performance in the second quarter of 2006. Overall, noninterest income, excluding operating lease revenues and securities gains and losses, increased by five percent over the same quarter last year and 16 percent on an annualized sequential basis.
Electronic payment processing revenues increased 15 percent over the same quarter last year and 30 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Second quarter trends are representative of continuing momentum in attracting new customer relationships moderated by slower growth in the level of retail sales transaction volumes. Fifth Third remains confident in the near and intermediate term growth outlook in this business and continues to see significant opportunities in attracting new financial institution customers and retailers.
Sales of retail deposit accounts and corporate treasury management products led to an increase in deposit service revenues of two percent over the same quarter last year and 27 percent on an annualized sequential basis from seasonally weaker first quarter levels. Retail deposit revenues increased by three percent over the same quarter last year largely due to growth in the number of deposit accounts. Commercial deposit revenues increased by two percent over the same quarter last year with strong growth in relationships mitigated by the impact of higher interest rates on compensating balances in commercial deposit accounts.
Mortgage net service revenue totaled $41 million in the second quarter compared to $46 million in the same quarter last year. Mortgage originations remained strong and totaled $2.6 billion in the second quarter versus $2.2 billion last quarter and $2.6 billion in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter mortgage banking net service revenue was comprised of $27 million in total origination fees and loan sales and $14 million in net servicing revenue. Net servicing revenue was comprised of $30 million of gross servicing fees, less $17 million in amortization and plus $1 million of net valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights and losses and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments utilized to hedge mortgage servicing rights. The mark-to-market adjustments and settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments and corresponding valuation adjustments resulted from interest rate volatility and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $483 million at June 30, 2006 on a servicing portfolio of $27.1 billion, compared to $462 million last quarter on a servicing portfolio of $26.4 billion.
Corporate banking revenue totaled $82 million in the second quarter this year, an increase of 10 percent over the $74 million delivered in the same quarter last year. Growth over the same quarter last year was highlighted by increases in loan and lease related fees and international revenues. Compared to the first quarter of 2006, corporate banking revenue increased $6 million due to growth in international revenues and customer interest rate derivative sales.
Investment advisory revenues increased by five percent over the same quarter last year and 22 percent on an annualized sequential basis. The increase in revenue compared to last year and the first quarter resulted primarily from improvements in brokerage and private client revenues. Fifth Third continues to focus its efforts on improving execution in retail brokerage and growing the institutional money management business by improving penetration and cross-sell in our large middle market commercial customer base. Fifth Third Investment Advisors, among the largest money managers in the Midwest, has $31 billion in assets under management and $203 billion in assets under care.

Other noninterest income totaled $76 million in the second quarter, compared to $80 million last quarter and $93 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease in revenue relative to second quarter 2005 resulted primarily from continued runoff in the operating lease portfolio and declines in consumer loan and lease fees. Net securities gains totaled $14 million in the second quarter, compared to $15 million in the same quarter last year and $1 million last quarter. Second quarter 2006 net securities gains included a $24 million gain from the MasterCard Incorporated redemption of a portion of the common shares held by Fifth Third, partially offset by $10 million of losses on certain securities sold during the quarter.
Balance Sheet Trends
Retail transaction account growth and commercial customer additions resulted in good overall deposit growth in the second quarter of 2006 despite continuing mix shifts within the deposit base to higher cost time deposits. Compared to the second quarter last year, average core deposit balances increased by $3.8 billion, or seven percent, and average transaction account balances increased by $1.7 billion, or three percent. Compared to the first quarter of 2006, average core deposit balances increased by seven percent on an annualized basis and average transaction account balances increased by three percent on an annualized basis. Fifth Third is continuing to devote significant focus on attracting new deposit accounts and retaining existing accounts in order to fund loan growth.
Loan and lease balances exhibited continued strength with average loans and leases increasing by $6.3 billion, or nine percent, over second quarter last year and by $6.4 billion, or 10 percent on a period end basis. Compared to last quarter, average loan and lease balances increased by $1.5 billion, or eight percent on an annualized sequential basis. Average commercial loan and lease balances increased by 11 percent over the same quarter last year and by $1.0 billion, or 10 percent on an annualized sequential basis. Average consumer loan and lease balances, excluding residential mortgage, increased by nine percent over the same quarter last year with only modest growth relative to last quarter primarily due to reductions in the consumer lease portfolio and slowing growth in home equity loan balances.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased five percent, despite three percent growth in average earning assets, due to a 28 bp decline in the net interest margin compared to the second quarter of 2005. Margin compression resulted primarily from the prolonged and significant flattening of the yield curve, decreases in the net interest rate spread associated with increases in rates paid across deposit and other funding categories and continued mix shifts within the deposit base to higher cost time deposits. Earning asset growth trends relative to the same quarter last year have been muted, despite strong loan growth, by a $3.5 billion reduction in the average available-for-sale securities portfolio. Fifth Third is focused on maintaining recent strong loan growth trends and growing core deposit balances in order to improve the funding mix, more effectively fund future loan growth and improve net interest margin trends.
Compared to the first quarter of 2006, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was essentially unchanged due to 7 bp of contraction in the net interest margin. Margin compression in the second

quarter was greater than initially expected and largely resulted from changes in short-term interest rate expectations during the quarter and the corresponding impact on the cost of certain non-core deposit funding categories.
Credit Quality
Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 37 bp in the second quarter, compared to 42 bp last quarter and 34 bp in the second quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs were $67 million in the second quarter, compared to $55 million in the same quarter last year and $73 million in the first quarter of 2006. Second quarter net charge-offs include losses related to the sale of approximately $39 million in nonaccrual loans and leases during the quarter. Nonperforming assets were 49 bp of total loans and leases and other real estate owned at June 30, 2006, compared to 51 bp last quarter and 51 bp in the year ago second quarter. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs remains a small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $71 million in the second quarter compared to $60 million in the same quarter last year and $78 million in the first quarter of 2006. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents 1.04 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of June 30, 2006, compared to 1.05 percent last quarter and 1.09 percent in the same quarter last year.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense increased by four percent over the same quarter last year and increased by $28 million from first quarter 2006 levels. The increase in expenses compared to prior periods is primarily due to the recognition of approximately $9 million of incremental expense related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) and the April 2006 issuance of stock-based awards to retirement-eligible employees, increases in volume-related bankcard expenditures and increases in occupancy expenditures related to the addition of de-novo banking centers.
Fifth Third expects growth in noninterest expenses in the second half of 2006 to continue to be modest with management focus in light of current revenue trends. Cost savings initiatives will be somewhat mitigated by continuing investment in certain high opportunity markets, including the expected addition of approximately 50 net new banking centers in 2006, in order to provide greater convenience to our customers and drive deposit and loan growth. Fifth Third's efficiency ratio was 55.3 percent in the second quarter compared to 54.7 percent last quarter and 52.2 percent in the second quarter of 2005.
