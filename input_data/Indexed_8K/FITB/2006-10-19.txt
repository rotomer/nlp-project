Exhibit 99.1
 
Fifth Third Bancorp's third quarter 2006 earnings per diluted share were $0.68 compared to $0.69 in the second quarter of 2006 and $0.71 per diluted share for the same period in 2005. Third quarter net income totaled $377 million compared with $382 million last quarter and $395 million in the same quarter last year.
"Third quarter results reflect a net interest margin that has begun to stabilize given moderation of short-term interest rate increases and our disciplined efforts to improve our balance sheet positioning," said George A. Schaefer, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "Additionally, noninterest income growth was within our expectations and expense control was solid, though we continue to invest in better distribution throughout our footprint. Credit costs remained relatively stable with previous quarters, though we recognize at this point in the credit cycle that some modest deterioration over time is to be expected. We remain focused on the long-term interests of our shareholders and believe we are making the right decisions to improve our franchise and position it for sustainable long-term growth. "
Net Interest Income
Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased slightly from last quarter despite a two bps decline in the net interest margin. Earning assets remained relatively flat reflecting an $819 million reduction in the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Margin compression lessened during the quarter on the moderation in short-term rate increases, and was less than initially expected due to better demand deposit trends in the latter part of the quarter.
Net interest income decreased three percent compared with the third quarter 2005 on two percent growth in average earning assets, reflecting a 17 bps decline in the net interest margin. Margin compression resulted primarily from the prolonged and significant flattening of the yield curve, decreases in the net interest rate spread associated with increases in rates paid across deposit and other funding categories, and mix shift within the deposit base to higher cost deposit categories. Despite strong loan growth, earning asset growth trends relative to the same quarter last year have been muted by a $3.5 billion reduction in the average available-for-sale securities portfolio. Fifth Third is focused on maintaining recent strong loan growth trends and growing core deposit balances in order to improve the funding mix, more effectively fund future loan growth and improve net interest margin trends.

Noninterest Income
Noninterest income increased by one percent compared with last quarter and six percent over the same quarter last year. Strong performance in electronic payment processing and corporate banking revenues were mitigated by trends in deposit service charges and mortgage banking revenue.
Electronic payment processing (EPP) revenue increased three percent sequentially largely reflecting strong growth in the merchant business, mitigated by the effects of slower consumer spending on EFT revenue. EPP revenue increased 15 percent over the same quarter last year on strong increases in EFT revenue and slower growth in the merchant business. Growth in the merchant business is expected to increase as national merchant contract additions announced throughout 2006 begin to be fully realized. Fifth Third remains confident in the near and intermediate term growth outlook in this business and continues to see significant opportunities in attracting new financial institution customers and retailers.
Deposit service revenue was stable compared with last quarter and declined two percent compared with the same quarter last year. Retail deposit revenue increased by four percent sequentially while commercial deposit revenue declined by five percent sequentially. Sequential growth in commercial relationships was more than mitigated by the impact of higher interest rates on earnings credits for compensating balances in deposit accounts. Compared with the same quarter last year, solid retail deposit account growth was offset by lower average balances, and higher earnings credit rates on commercial deposit accounts more than offset new account additions and treasury management product sales.
Investment advisory revenue declined eight percent versus a seasonally strong second quarter that reflected annually assessed trust and tax related fees. Results were flat compared with the same quarter last year. Fifth Third continues to focus its efforts on improving execution in retail brokerage and retail mutual funds, and on growing the institutional money management business by improving penetration and cross-sell in our large middle market commercial customer base.
Corporate banking revenue totaled $79 million in the third quarter, a decline of four percent sequentially, primarily reflecting lower fees associated with letters of credit. Revenue increased 11 percent over the $71 million earned in the same quarter last year, highlighted by increases in institutional fees and other commercial fees.
Mortgage banking net revenue totaled $36 million, reflecting $21 million in total origination fees and loan sales and $15 million in net servicing revenue, compared with $41 million last quarter and $45 million a year ago. Mortgage originations were $2.3 billion in the third quarter versus $2.6 billion last quarter and $2.9 billion in the third quarter of 2005. Net servicing revenue included $30 million of gross servicing fees, less $18 million in amortization, plus $3 million in net MSR valuation adjustment. The net MSR valuation adjustment included mark-to-market adjustments, settlement of free-standing derivative financial instruments, and corresponding valuation adjustments, resulting from interest rate volatility and the resulting impact of changing prepayment speeds on the mortgage servicing portfolio. The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $498 million at quarter end on a servicing portfolio of $27.8 billion, compared with $483 million last quarter on a servicing portfolio of $27.1 billion.
Other noninterest income totaled $87 million in the third quarter, compared with $76 million last quarter and $82 million in the same quarter last year. The increases reflect net gains totaling $10.5 million from the sale of three Indiana branches announced in May 2006 and the sale of $23 million of out-of-footprint credit card receivables, both

completed in September. Strength in cardholder and loan fees otherwise offset the effect of runoff in the consumer lease portfolio.
Net securities gains totaled $19 million in the third quarter, compared with $14 million last quarter and $8 million in the same quarter last year. Third quarter 2006 net securities gains included a $53 million gain from sale of MasterCard, Inc. shares. Results also included $34 million of losses on investment securities.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense increased by $8 million or one percent from second quarter 2006 levels and by five percent over the same quarter last year. Comparisons reflect an $11 million charge in the third quarter associated with the early extinguishment of debt in the form of a $300 million structured repurchase agreement. Sequential comparisons also reflect an additional $8 million of pension settlement expenses, similar to the level experienced in the third quarter of last year. Second quarter expenses included $9 million of expense related to the April 2006 issuance of stock-based awards to retirement-eligible employees. Excluding the above-mentioned items, noninterest expense was flat sequentially and increased three percent compared with last year. The remaining increase versus the year ago quarter primarily reflected higher volume-related bankcard expenditures and occupancy expenditures related to the addition of de-novo banking centers. Fifth Third's efficiency ratio was 55.5 percent in the third quarter compared to 55.3 percent last quarter and 53.5 percent in the third quarter of 2005.
Balance Sheet Trends
Average core deposits were relatively stable with second quarter levels, declining one percent on lower interest checking, demand and money market deposits, largely offset by growth in retail CDs and savings deposits. Compared with the third quarter last year, average core deposits rose five percent on growth in savings, retail CDs and money market accounts. Fifth Third continues to devote significant focus on attracting new deposit accounts and retaining existing accounts in order to fund loan growth.
Average loan and lease balances grew one percent sequentially, or five percent annualized. Average loans and leases increased by $5.4 billion, or eight percent, over third quarter last year. Commercial loans grew ten percent compared with the year ago and consumer loans grew five percent. Excluding run-off in the consumer lease portfolio totaling $524 million, loans and leases grew nine percent versus last year.
Credit Quality
Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 43 bps in the third quarter, compared with 37 bps last quarter and 38 bps in the third quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs were $79 million in the third quarter, compared with $64 million in the same quarter last year and $67 million in the second quarter of 2006. Gross charge-offs were $96 million, or 53 bps of loans and leases, consistent with levels in the prior two quarters. Recoveries were $17 million in the third quarter, down $12 million from high second quarter recovery levels. Nonperforming assets were 56 bps of total loans and leases and other real estate owned at quarter end, up 7 bps sequentially, with the net increase largely driven by two credits totaling $32 million. Nonperforming assets were 49 bps last quarter and 51 bps in the third quarter a year ago. Overall, the level of nonperforming loans and net charge-offs continues to represent a relatively small percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $87 million in the third quarter compared

with $71 million last quarter and $69 million in the same quarter last year. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents 1.04 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of quarter end, compared with 1.04 percent last quarter and 1.06 percent in the same quarter last year.
