This report contains statements about Fifth Third Bancorp ("Fifth Third") that we believe are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder, that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as "will likely result," "may," "are expected to," "is anticipated," "estimate," "forecast," "projected," "intends to," or may include other similar words or phrases such as "believes," "plans," "trend," "objective," "continue," "remain," or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could," "might," "can," or similar verbs. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the risk factors set forth in our most recent Form 10-K. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements we may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to us.
There are a number of important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (1) competitive pressures on financial institutions may increase significantly; (2) changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins; (3) prepayment speeds, loan originations and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions are inherently uncertain; (4) general economic conditions, either national or in the states in which we do business, may be less favorable than expected; (5) political developments, wars or other hostilities may disrupt or increase volatility in securities markets or other economic conditions; (6) changes and trends in the securities markets; (7) legislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, may adversely affect the businesses in which we are engaged; (8) difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities; (9) our ability to maintain favorable ratings from rating agencies; (10) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; (11) changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies; (12) fluctuation of our stock price; (13) ability to attract and retain our key personnel; (14) ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries; (15) potential dilutive effect of future acquisitions on current shareholders' ownership of Fifth Third; (16) ability to secure confidential information through the use of computer systems and telecommunications network; and (17) the impact of reputational risk created by these developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity.
You should refer to our periodic and current reports filed with the SEC for further information on other factors which could cause actual results to be significantly different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Copies of those filings are available at no cost on the SEC's Web site at or on our Web site at . We undertake no obligation to release revisions to these forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report.

A copy of the RCC is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In connection with the issuance of the JSNs, Alston & Bird LLP, special tax counsel to Fifth Third, rendered an opinion regarding certain tax matters.

Preferred Securities, as beneficial owners of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, that such counsel may note that the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities and of the Trust Common Securities may be obligated, pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, to (a) provide indemnity and/or security in connection with and pay taxes or governmental charges arising from transfers or exchanges of Trust Preferred Security certificates and the issuance of replacement of Trust Preferred Security certificates, and (b) provide security and indemnity in connection with requests of or directions to the Property Trustee (as defined in the Declaration of Trust) to exercise its rights and remedies under the Declaration of Trust;
provided
(vii)        The Trust Common Securities have been duly authorized by the Declaration of Trust and when issued and delivered by the Trust to the Guarantor against payment therefor described in the Declaration of Trust, will be validly issued and fully paid (subject to the qualifications described in the proviso to clause (vi) next above) beneficial interests in the Trust. The Guarantor, as holder of the Trust Common Securities, will be entitled to the benefits of the Declaration of Trust;
(viii)        Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and the Declaration of Trust, the issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities is not subject to preemptive rights;
(ix)        The issuance and sale by the Trust of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities, the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of this Agreement and the Other Trust Transaction Agreements, the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance by the Trust with its obligations hereunder and thereunder do not violate (A) any of the provisions of the Certificate of Trust of the Trust or the Declaration of Trust, or (B) any applicable Delaware law or administrative regulation;
(x)        No authorization, approval, consent or order of any Delaware court or Delaware governmental authority or Delaware agency is required to be obtained by the Trust solely in connection with the issuance and sale of the Trust Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities or the execution, delivery and performance by the Trust of this Agreement or the Other Trust Transaction Agreements. In rendering the opinion expressed in this paragraph (x), such counsel need express no opinion concerning the securities laws of the State of Delaware; and
(xi)        Assuming that the Trust derives no income from or connected with services provided within the State of Delaware and has no assets, activities (other than maintaining the Delaware Trustee and the filing of documents with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware) or employees in the State of Delaware and assuming that the Trust is treated as a grantor trust or as an association not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, the
 
holders of Trust Preferred Securities (other than those holders who reside or are domiciled in the State of Delaware) will have no liability for income taxes imposed by the State of Delaware solely as a result of their participation in the Trust, and the Trust will not be liable for any income tax imposed by the State of Delaware.
(e)        Alston & Bird LLP, special tax counsel to the Guarantor and the Trust, shall have furnished to the Underwriters an opinion, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative and its counsel, including an opinion to the effect that the statements set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as it purports to constitute a summary of U.S. federal income tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters set forth therein in all material respects.
(f)        The Underwriters shall have received from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to such matters as the Underwriters may reasonably require. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP may rely (i) as to those matters that relate to the Indenture Trustee, the Guarantee Trustee or the Property Trustee upon the certificate or certificates of such entities, (ii) as to matters involving the application of laws of the State of Ohio upon the opinions of Graydon Head & Ritchey LLP and Paul L. Reynolds, Esq. delivered pursuant to Sections 6(b) and (c), respectively; and (iii) as to certain other matters on certificates of responsible officers of the Guarantor, public officials and others deemed by such counsel to be responsible.
(g)        On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement, at 9:30 A.M., New York City time, on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at the Time of Delivery, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to you a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex I hereto (the executed copy of the letter delivered prior to the execution of this Agreement is attached as Annex I(a) hereto and a form of letter to be delivered on the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, and as of the Time of Delivery is attached as Annex I(b) hereto).
(h)        (i) Neither the Guarantor nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representative so material and adverse as to
 
make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Trust Preferred Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
(i)        The Guarantor shall have complied with the provisions of the first sentence of Section 5(A)(d) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York business day next succeeding the date of this Agreement.
(j)        On or after the Applicable Time, the Trust Preferred Securities shall have been accorded a rating of not less than "A-" by Standard & Poor's Ratings Service, not less than "A1" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and not less than "A+" by Fitch Ratings.
(k)        On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Guarantor's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Guarantor's debt securities or preferred stock.
(l)        On or after the Applicable Time there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Guarantor's securities on the Nasdaq Global Market; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or Ohio authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iii) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (iv) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iii) or (iv) in the judgment of the Representative makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Trust Preferred Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
(m)        The Guarantor and the Trust shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Guarantor and trustees of the Trust satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Guarantor and the Trust herein at and as of such time, as to the performance by the Guarantor and the Trust of all of their respective obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (h) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
7.         .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a)        The Guarantor and the Trust will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
 
of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by or on behalf of any Underwriter expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b)        Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Guarantor and the Trust, each of the Guarantor's directors, each of the Guarantor's officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Guarantor or the Trust may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by or on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Guarantor or the Trust for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Guarantor or the Trust, as appropriate, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c)        Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified
 
party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided that, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under Section 7(a) or (b) for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party (other than reasonable costs of investigation) in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate national counsel, approved by the Representative, representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)        If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or
 
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Trust Preferred Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Guarantor or the Trust bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Trust Preferred Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e)        The obligations of the Guarantor under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Guarantor or the Trust may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have.
 
8.        . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Trust Preferred Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Trust Preferred Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter, you do not arrange for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities, then the Guarantor shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representative to purchase such Trust Preferred Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Guarantor that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities, or the Guarantor notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities, you or the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Guarantor agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Trust Preferred Securities.
Underwriter Default
(b)        If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Trust Preferred Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Trust Preferred Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Trust Preferred Securities, then the Guarantor shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Trust Preferred Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Trust Preferred Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Trust Preferred Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c)        If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Trust Preferred Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Trust Preferred Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Trust Preferred Securities, or if the Guarantor shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Trust Preferred Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Guarantor, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
9.        . If for any reason the Trust Preferred Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Guarantor as provided herein other than because of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8, the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Trust Preferred
Expenses on Termination
 
Securities but the Guarantor shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Section 5A(j) and Section 7. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Guarantor and the Trust shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities, except as provided in Sections 5A(j) and 7 hereof.
10.        . Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
Time of the Essence
11.        . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Guarantor or its officers, of the Trust and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Guarantor or the Trust or any of the controlling persons referred to in Section 7(e) hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Trust Preferred Securities. The provisions of Sections 5(A)(j) and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
12.        . The Trust and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the Trust Preferred Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Trust or the Guarantor; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Trust or the Guarantor with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Trust or the Guarantor on other matters) or any other obligation to the Trust or the Guarantor except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Trust and the Guarantor have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate. The Trust and the Guarantor each agree that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Trust or the Guarantor, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
Arm's-Length Terms
13.        . This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Guarantor and the Underwriters, or the Trust and the Underwriters, or the Guarantor or the Trust and any of the Underwriters, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Prior Agreements
14.        . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, executors, and administrators, and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
Successors
15.        . This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

16.        . The Guarantor, the Trust and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Waiver of Jury Trial
17.        . This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

ANNEX I
Pursuant to Section 6(g) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:
(i)    They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Guarantor and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "PCAOB");
(ii)    In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules (and, if applicable, financial forecasts and/or pro forma financial information) audited or examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information, financial forecasts and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the Guarantor for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the Underwriters;
(iii)    The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Guarantor for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus and/or included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Guarantor's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for such five fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in the Guarantor's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;

(v)        Until the JSNs are paid in full, the Company will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event:
 
(A)        to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during a 180-day period ending on the date, not more than 30 and not less than 10 Business Days before the Scheduled Maturity Date, on which the Company delivers the notice required by clause (vi) of this Section 2.2(a) and Section 3.1, to permit repayment of the JSNs in full on the Scheduled Maturity Date pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.2(a); and
(B)        if the Company is unable for any reason to raise sufficient proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities to permit repayment in full of the JSNs on the Scheduled Maturity Date (as required by clause (A) above) or any subsequent Interest Payment Date, to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during a 90-day period ending on the date, not more than 30 and not less than 10 Business Days before the following Interest Payment Date, on which the Company delivers the notice required by clause (vi) of this Section 2.2(a) and Section 3.1, to permit repayment of the JSNs in full on such following Interest Payment Date pursuant to clause (i)(z) of this Section 2.2(a).
(vi)        The Company shall, if it has not raised sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to clause (iv) above in connection with any Repayment Date, deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee (which the Trustee shall promptly forward upon receipt to the Property Trustee) no more than 15 and no less than 10 Business Days in advance of such Repayment Date stating the amount of net proceeds, if any, raised pursuant to clause (v) above in connection with such Repayment Date and the corresponding principal amount of the JSNs represented thereby. The Company shall be excused from its obligation to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to clause (v) above if such Officers' Certificate further certifies that: (A) a Market Disruption Event was existing during the 180-day period preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate or, in the case of any Repayment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date, the 90-day period (or if the Scheduled Maturity Date has been extended to April 15, 2047, the 30-day period) preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate; and (B) either (1) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire 180-, 90- or 30-day period, as the case may be, or (2) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of the period, but the Company was unable after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient net proceeds during the rest of that period to permit repayment of the JSNs in full pursuant to clause (v) above. Each Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to this clause (vi), unless no principal amount of JSNs is to be repaid on the applicable Repayment Date, will be accompanied by a notice of repayment pursuant to Section 3.1 setting forth the principal amount of the JSNs to be repaid on such Repayment Date, if any, which amount will be determined after giving effect to clause (vii) of this Section 2.2(a).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company raises less than $5 million of net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during the relevant 180-, 90- or 30-day period, the Company will not be required to repay any JSNs on the applicable Repayment Date. On the next Interest Payment Date as of which the Company has raised at least $5 million of net proceeds during the 180-day period preceding the applicable notice date (or, if shorter, the period since the Company last repaid any principal amount of JSNs), the Company shall be required to repay a principal amount of the JSNs equal to the entire net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during such 180-day or shorter period.
(viii)        The Company shall not amend the Replacement Capital Covenant to amend the definitions incorporated into this Supplemental Indenture pursuant to Section 1.1 or to impose additional restrictions on the type or amount of Qualifying Capital Securities that the Company may include for purposes of determining when repayment, redemption or purchase of the JSNs or the Trust Preferred Securities is permitted, except with the consent of holders of a majority by liquidation amount of the Trust Preferred Securities or, if the JSNs have been distributed by the Trust to the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities, a majority by principal amount of the JSNs. Except as aforesaid, the Company may amend or supplement the Replacement Capital Covenant in accordance with its terms and without the consent of the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities or the JSNs.

The interest will accrue from March 30, 2007 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest will be computed on the basis of (i) a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months with respect to any Interest Period ending on or prior to April 15, 2017 and (ii) a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed with respect to any other Interest Period.

Upon termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest then due on any Interest Payment Date, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period pursuant to this Section 2.5.

(ii)        At the end of any Deferral Period, the Company will pay all deferred interest on the JSNs to the Persons in whose names the JSNs are registered in the Securities Register at the close of business on the Regular Record Date with respect to the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period.
(iii)        The Company may elect to pay interest on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period to the extent permitted by Section 2.5(b).
(b)        .

funds and (ii) if a Supervisory Event has occurred and is continuing, then the Company may (but is not obligated to) pay deferred interest with cash from any source. In addition, if the Company sells Qualifying APM Securities pursuant to Section 2.7 but a Supervisory Event arises from the Federal Reserve disapproving the use of the proceeds to pay deferred interest, the Company may use the proceeds for other purposes and continue to defer interest on the JSNs.
(c)        . If the Company is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after its consummation more than 50% of the voting stock of the Person formed by such Business Combination, or the Person that is the surviving entity of such Business Combination, or the Person to whom such properties and assets are conveyed, transferred or leased in such Business Combination, is owned by the shareholders of the other party to such Business Combination, then Section 2.5(b) and Section 2.7 will not apply to any Deferral Period that is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of such Business Combination (or if later, at any time within 90 days following the date of consummation of the Business Combination).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special tax counsel to Fifth Third Bancorp ("Fifth Third") in connection with the issuance of junior subordinated notes by Fifth Third, the issuance of Trust Preferred Securities by Fifth Third Capital Trust IV and the filing of a registration statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-141560 and 333-141560-01)(the "Registration Statement") by them under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The junior subordinated notes will be issued pursuant the Junior Subordinated Indenture dated as of March 20, 1997 between Fifth Third and Wilmington Trust Company, as indenture trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 30, 2007. The Trust Preferred Securities will be issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of Fifth Third Capital Trust IV dated as of March 30, 2007 as offered for sale to investors pursuant to the prospectus dated March 26, 2007, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated March 26, 2007 (the "Prospectus"). Capitalized terms herein used and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of March 26, 2007.
 
 
March 30, 2007
Page 2
We have reviewed copies of (1) the Prospectus and (2) such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth below. We have further assumed (i) that all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, (ii) with respect to all documents supplied to us as drafts, that the final, executed versions of such documents are identical in all material respects to the versions most recently supplied to us, (iii) that each such final version (when executed) is valid and enforceable in accordance with its terms, and (iv) that the Trust Preferred Securities will be sold at the offering price stated on the cover of the Prospectus.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, (i) the junior subordinated notes to be held by Fifth Third Capital Trust IV will be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as indebtedness of Fifth Third (although the matter is not free from doubt); (ii) Fifth Third Capital Trust IV will be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and will not be subject to tax as a corporation; and (iii) the discussion under the heading "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Prospectus constitutes a fair and accurate summary of the matters discussed therein in all material respects. In rendering this tax opinion, we have considered the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and Internal Revenue Service rulings, all of which are subject to change, which changes may be retroactively applied. A change in the authorities upon which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions. There can be no assurance, moreover, that any of the opinions expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service, or, if challenged, by a court.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to Fifth Third's Form 8-K (which is deemed incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement) and to the references to this firm under the headings "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Validity of Securities" in the Registration Statement and Prospectus without admitting that we are "experts" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued thereunder, with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this exhibit. We do not undertake to advise you of any changes in the opinions expressed herein or in the discussion under the heading "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" contained in the Registration Statement resulting from matters that might hereafter arise or be brought to our attention.
