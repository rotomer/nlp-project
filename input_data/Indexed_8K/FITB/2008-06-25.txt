This report contains statements about Fifth Third Bancorp ("Fifth Third") that we believe are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder, that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as "will likely result," "may," "are expected to," "is anticipated," "estimate," "forecast," "projected," "intends to," or may include other similar words or phrases such as "believes," "plans," "trend," "objective," "continue," "remain," or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could," "might," "can," or similar verbs. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the risk factors set forth in our most recent Form 10-K. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements we may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to us.
There are a number of important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (1) general economic conditions and weakening in the economy, specifically, the real estate market, either national or in the states in which Fifth Third, one or more acquired entities and/or the combined company do business, are less favorable than expected; (2) deteriorating credit quality; (3) political developments, wars or other hostilities may disrupt or increase volatility in securities markets or other economic conditions; (4) changes in the interest rate environment reduce interest margins; (5) prepayment speeds, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions; (6) our ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity; (7) changes and trends in capital markets; (8) competitive pressures among depository institutions increase significantly; (9) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments and the use of estimates for results of current or future periods; (10) changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies; (11) legislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, adversely affect Fifth Third, one or more acquired entities and/or the combined company or the businesses in which Fifth Third, one or more acquired entities and/or the combined company are engaged; (12) ability to maintain favorable ratings from rating agencies; (13) fluctuation of Fifth Third's stock price; (14) ability to attract and retain key personnel; (15) ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries; (16) the potentially dilutive effect of future acquisitions on current shareholders' ownership of Fifth Third; (17) effects of accounting or financial results of one or more acquired entities; (18) difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities; (19) ability to secure confidential information through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; and (20) the impact of reputational risk created by these developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity.
You should refer to our periodic and current reports filed with the SEC for further information on other factors which could cause actual results to be significantly different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Copies of those filings are available at no cost on the SEC's Web site at or on our Web site at . We undertake no obligation to release revisions to these forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report.

If the conversion date is prior to the record date for any declared dividend on Series G Preferred Stock for the dividend period in which the holder elects to convert, the holder will not receive any declared dividends for that dividend period. If the conversion date is after the record date for any declared dividend and prior to the dividend payment date, the holder will receive that dividend on the relevant dividend payment date if the holder was the holder of record on the record date for that dividend; , whether or not the holder was the holder of record on the record date, if the holder converts after a record date and prior to the related dividend payment date, the holder must pay to the conversion agent (as defined in Paragraph 4(xiii)) when the holder converts the holder's shares of Series G Preferred Stock an amount in cash equal to the full dividend actually paid on the dividend payment date for the then-current dividend period on the shares being converted, unless the holder's shares of Series G Preferred Stock are being converted as a consequence of a mandatory conversion at the option of the corporation, a make-whole acquisition or a fundamental change as described below in Paragraph 4(ii), Paragraph 4(v) and Paragraph 4(vi).

The corporation will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Series G Preferred Stock or shares of the corporation's common stock or other securities issued on account of Series G Preferred Stock or certificates representing such shares or securities. The corporation will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, shares of the corporation's common stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the shares of Series G Preferred Stock with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the corporation, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

On or after June 30, 2013, the corporation may, at its option, at any time or from time to time cause some or all of the Series G Preferred Stock to be converted into shares of the corporation's common stock at the then applicable conversion rate. The corporation may exercise its conversion right if, for twenty (20) trading days within any period of thirty (30) consecutive trading days, including the last trading day of such period, ending on the trading day preceding the date the corporation gives notice of mandatory conversion, the closing price of the corporation's common stock exceeds 130% of the then applicable conversion price of the Series G Preferred Stock.

The corporation will notify holders, at least twenty (20) days prior to the anticipated make-whole acquisition effective date of such make-whole acquisition, or within two business days of becoming aware of a make-whole acquisition described in Paragraph 4(v)(a)(i) of the anticipated make-whole acquisition effective date of such transaction. The notice will specify the anticipated make-whole acquisition effective date of the make-whole acquisition and the date by which each holder's make-whole acquisition conversion right must be exercised, which shall be thirty (30) days after the make-whole acquisition effective date. The corporation will also notify holders on the make-whole acquisition effective date of such make-whole acquisition, or as soon as practicable thereafter, specifying, among other things, the date that is thirty (30) days after the make-whole acquisition effective date, the number of make-whole shares and the amount of the cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the holder upon conversion. To exercise the make-whole acquisition conversion right, a holder must deliver to the conversion agent, on or before the close of business on the date specified in the notice, the certificate evidencing such holder's shares of the Series G Preferred Stock, if the shares of the Series G Preferred Stock are held in certificated form.

Make-Whole Shares
 
 
The exact common stock price and effective dates may not be set forth on the table, in which case:
 
 
 
The number of make-whole shares will be determined by reference to the table above and is based on the make-whole acquisition effective date and the price (the "") paid per share of the corporation's common stock in such transaction. If the holders of the corporation's common stock receive only cash (in a single per-share amount, other than with respect to appraisal and similar rights) in the make-whole acquisition, the share price shall be the cash amount paid per share. For purposes of the preceding sentence as applied to a make-whole acquisition described in Paragraph 4(v)(a)(x) above, a single price per share shall be deemed to have been paid only if the transaction or transactions that caused the person or group to become direct or indirect ultimate beneficial owners of the corporation's common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of the corporation's common stock was a tender offer for more than 50% of the corporation's outstanding common stock. Otherwise, the share price shall be the average of the closing price per share of the corporation's common stock on the ten (10) trading days up to but not including the make-whole acquisition effective date.
share price
The share prices set forth in the second column of the table will be adjusted as of any date on which the conversion rate of the Series G Preferred Stock is adjusted. The adjusted share prices will equal the share prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the conversion rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the share price adjustment and the denominator of which is the conversion rate as so adjusted. Each of the number of make-whole shares in the table will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the conversion rate as set forth under Paragraph 4(viii).
(vi) . In lieu of receiving the make-whole shares, if the reference price (as defined below) in connection with a make-whole acquisition is less than $9.26, subject to adjustment (a "fundamental change"), a holder may elect to convert each share of Series G Preferred Stock during the period beginning on the effective date of the fundamental change and ending on the date that is thirty (30) days after the effective date of the fundamental change at an adjusted conversion price equal to the greater of
Conversion Upon Fundamental Change
 
(1) the reference price and (2) $ 4.63, subject to adjustment (the "base price"). The base price will be adjusted as of any date that the conversion rate of the Series G Preferred Stock is adjusted. The adjusted base price will equal the base price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the conversion rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the conversion rate adjustment and the denominator of which is the conversion rate as so adjusted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) no adjustment will be made for the issuance of the corporation's common stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of the corporation's
 
common stock that is made in lieu of a quarterly or annual cash dividend or distribution to such holders, to the extent such dividend or distribution does not exceed the applicable "dividend threshold amount" (as defined below) (with the amount of any such dividend or distribution equaling the number of such shares being issued multiplied by the average of the VWAP of the corporation's common stock over each of the five consecutive VWAP trading days prior to the ex-date for such dividend or distribution) and (2) in the event any dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination that is the subject of this Paragraph 4(viii)(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the conversion rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay or make such dividend or distribution or effect such subdivision or combination, to the conversion rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared or such subdivision or combination had not been announced.
(b) the issuance to all holders of the corporation's common stock of certain rights or warrants (other than rights issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan or rights or warrants issued in connection with a transaction constituting a reorganization event) entitling them for a period expiring sixty (60) days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of the corporation's common stock (or securities convertible into the corporation's common stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the current market price of the shares of the corporation's common stock as of the record date, in which event the conversion rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

Pending the preparation of definitive Receipts, the Depositary, upon, and pursuant to, the written order of the Company delivered in compliance with Section 2.02 shall be authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver temporary Receipts which shall be substantially of the tenor of the definitive Receipts in lieu of which they are issued and in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the persons executing such Receipts may determine (but which do not affect the rights or duties of the Depositary), as evidenced by their execution of such Receipts. If temporary Receipts are issued, the Company and the Depositary will cause definitive Receipts to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at the Depositary Office without charge to the holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Receipts, the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts. Such exchange shall be made at the Company's expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Deposit Agreement, and with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited, as definitive Receipts.
Exhibit A
(b)                    Receipts shall be executed by the Depositary by the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary; provided, that if a Registrar for the Receipts (other than the Depositary) shall have been appointed then such Receipts shall also be countersigned by manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Registrar. No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed as provided in the preceding sentence. The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt executed as provided above and delivered as hereinafter provided. Receipts bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary who was at any time a proper signatory of the Depositary shall bind the Depositary, notwithstanding that such signatory ceased to hold such office prior to the execution and delivery of such Receipts by the Registrar or did not hold such office on the date of issuance of such Receipts.
(c)                    Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary Shares. All Receipts shall be dated the date of their issuance. Receipts may be endorsed with or have incorporated in the text thereof such legends or recitals or changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by the Depositary and approved by the
 
Company, or which the Company has determined are required to comply with any applicable law or regulation or with the rules and regulations of any securities exchange upon which the Depositary Shares may be listed for trading or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which any particular Receipts are subject, in each case as directed by the Company.
(d)                    Title to any Receipt (and to the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt) that is properly endorsed, or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer, or endorsement shall be transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of a negotiable instrument; provided, however, that until transfer of a Receipt shall be registered on the books of the Depositary as provided in Section 2.04, the Depositary may, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption, voting, or conversion rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
(e)                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or the Transfer Agent or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
(f)                    If issued, the DTC Receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipt shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC
 
Receipt, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal or conversion of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.

(f)                    If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-

(d)                    Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (i) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (ii) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (iii) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such
 
Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
(e)                    As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company (or cash in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 4(ix) of the Certificate of Designation) and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.12 and which has been provided by the Company. If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date with respect to any dividend payment on the Convertible Preferred Stock and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
(f)                    In the event that Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change conversion is elected by a holder with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected. Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
SECTION 2.11.  .
Conversion at the Option of the Company
(a)                    In connection with any conversion at the option of the Company in accordance with the Certificate of Designation, the Company shall deliver an Officers'
 
Certificate (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) to the Depositary stating that it has complied with all of the conditions to the exercise of its optional conversion rights set forth in the Certificate of Designation, and the Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to inquire or investigate whether the Company has complied with the terms of the Certificate of Designation.
(b)                    If the Company exercises such conversion right, it shall provide written notice of such conversion to the Depositary stating, in addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock; (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such shares held by such holder to be so converted; and (v) the place or places where the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
(c)                    Upon receipt of such notice, the Depositary shall as promptly as practicable provide notice of the Company's exercise of such conversion right to each holder of Receipts, which notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall state (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the Depositary Shares to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
On the date of any conversion at the option of the Company, if a holder's interest is in certificated form a holder of a Receipt must surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied. If a holder's interest is a beneficial interest in a global certificate representing Receipts, in order to convert a holder shall comply with DTC's and the Depositary's procedures for converting a beneficial interest in a global security. In addition, a holder may be required to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes and pay funds equal to any declared but unpaid dividend payable on the next dividend payment date.
(d)                    Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt in connection with a conversion at the option of the Company, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (i) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and
 
the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (ii) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (iii) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
(e)                    As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company. In the event that conversion at the option of the Company is effected with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such conversion was not effected.
(f)                    Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
(g)                    If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is converted pursuant to a conversion at the option of the Company, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be converted pursuant to this Section 2.11 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable. If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a holder's Depositary Shares for partial conversion at the option of the Company and the holder converts a portion of the same share of Depositary Shares, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion.
SECTION 2.12.  .
Fractional Shares
No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock,
 
calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Common Stock on the trading day (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, which shall be paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion are correct.
SECTION 2.13.  .
No Pre-Release
The Depositary shall not deliver any deposited Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by Receipts prior to the receipt and cancellation of such Receipts or other similar method used with respect to Receipts held by DTC. The Depositary shall not issue any Receipts prior to the receipt by the Depositary of the corresponding Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by such Receipts. At no time will any Receipts be outstanding if such Receipts do not represent Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary.
 
SECTION 3.01.   .
Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information
Any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary such proof of residence, guarantee of signature or other information and to execute such certificates as the Depositary may reasonably deem necessary or proper or the Company may reasonably require by written request to the Depositary. The Depositary or the Company may withhold or delay the delivery of any Receipt, the transfer or exchange of any Receipt, the withdrawal of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt, the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof, until such proof or other information is filed, or such certificates are executed.
SECTION 3.02.   .
Payment of Fees and Expenses
Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges to the extent provided in Section 5.07, or provide evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that such fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges have been paid. Until such payment is made, transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of the Convertible Preferred Stock or money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused, any dividend or other distribution may be withheld, and any part or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder a reasonable number of days prior to such sale). Any dividend or other distribution so withheld and the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such fees or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
SECTION 3.03.   .
Representations and Warranties as to Convertible Preferred Stock
In the case of the initial deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder, the Company represents and warrants that such Convertible Preferred Stock and each certificate therefor are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

SECTION 3.04.   .
Representation and Warranty as to Receipts and Depositary Shares
The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/250th fractional interest in a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.
 
SECTION 3.05.   .
Taxes
The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
 
SECTION 4.01.   .
Cash Distributions
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; provided, however, that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
SECTION 4.02.   .
Distributions Other Than Cash
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
SECTION 4.03.   .
Rights, Preferences or Privileges
(a)                     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the
 
Company any rights, preferences or privileges of any nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); provided, however, that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
(b)                     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement, and that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
(c)                     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
(d)                     The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
 
SECTION 4.04.   .
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts
Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting.
SECTION 4.05.   .
Voting Rights
Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/250th of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will not vote the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
SECTION 4.06.   .
Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events
Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary
 
shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the conversion rate of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.
SECTION 4.07.   .
Inspection of Reports
The Depositary shall make available for inspection by holders of Receipts at the Depositary Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Company that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and made generally available to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Company, certain notices and reports to the holders of Receipts as provided in Section 5.05.
SECTION 4.08.   .
Lists of Receipt Holders
Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, the Registrar shall furnish to the Company a list, as of a recent date specified by the Company, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all persons in whose names Receipts are registered on the books of the Registrar.
SECTION 4.09.   .
Withholding
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; provided, however, that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate
 
sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.
 
SECTION 5.01.   .
Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary and the Registrar
(a)                     The Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary Office facilities for the execution and delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up and combination of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up and combination of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
(b)                     The Registrar shall keep books at the Depositary Office for the registration and transfer of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts as provided by applicable law. The Company may cause the Registrar to close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
(c)                     If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Company, appoint a registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with the requirements of such exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the request and expense of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender, and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.
SECTION 5.02.   .
Prevention or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Company
None of the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, or the Company shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt, if by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation thereunder of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar or Transfer Agent, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Certificate of Incorporation or, in the case of the Company, the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor
 
shall the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, any Registrar or the Company incur any liability to any holder of a Receipt by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement.
SECTION 5.03.   .
Obligations of the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company
(a)                     Except as otherwise provided by this Deposit Agreement (including without limitation Section 5.06), the Company does not assume any obligation and shall not be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement or any Receipt to holders of Receipts other than from acts or omissions arising out of conduct constituting bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement. Neither the Depositary, nor the Conversion Agent nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company, nor the Depositary, nor the Conversion Agent nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary, the Conversion Agent and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
(b)                     None of the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
(c)                     None of the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, the Conversion Agent, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
(d)                     In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the
 
Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
(e)                     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Depositary undertakes, and the Conversion Agent and any Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary, the Conversion Agent or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
(f)                     The Depositary, its parent, affiliate, or subsidiaries, any Depositary's Agent, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent may own, buy, sell or deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in Receipts or Depositary Shares or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company or its affiliates may be interested or contract with or lend money to or otherwise act as fully or as freely as if it were not the Depositary or the Depositary's Agent hereunder. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
(g)                     It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.
(h)                     Neither the Depositary (or its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates) nor the Conversion Agent nor any Depositary's Agent makes any representation or has any responsibility as to the validity of the registration statement pursuant to which the Depositary Shares are registered under the Securities Act, the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares, the Receipts (except its countersignature thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein, or as to the correctness of any statement made therein or herein; provided, however, that the Depositary is responsible for its representations in this Deposit Agreement.
(i)                     The Company agrees that it will register the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and the Depositary Shares in accordance with the applicable securities laws.
(j)                     In the event the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent or any Registrar or Transfer Agent believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by it pursuant to this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall promptly notify the Company of the details of such
 
alleged ambiguity or uncertainty, and may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action, and the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability to any person from refraining from taking such action, absent bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction), unless and until (i) the rights of all parties have been fully and finally adjudicated by a court of appropriate jurisdiction or (ii) the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar receives written instructions with respect to such matter signed by the Company that eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar.
(k)                     Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided and established by a certificate signed by any one of the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, Head of Corporate Finance, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar; and such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar and the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent or Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
(l)                     The Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar will not be under any duty or responsibility to ensure compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance, transfer or exchange of the Receipts, Stock or Depositary Shares.
(m)                     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment to the Certificate of Designation shall affect the rights, duties, obligations or immunities of the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Depositary's Agent or Registrar hereunder.

(o)                     The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.03 shall survive the replacement, removal or resignation of any Depositary, Registrar, Transfer Agent or Depositary's Agent or termination of this Deposit Agreement.
SECTION 5.04.   .

Company, such resignation to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and conversion agent and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
(b)                     The Depositary and the Conversion Agent may at any time be removed by the Company by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary and the Conversion Agent, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts.
(c)                     In case at any time the Depositary and the Conversion Agent acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Company shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor depositary and conversion agent, which shall be an entity having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If a successor depositary shall not have been appointed and have accepted appointment in 60 days, the resigning Depositary and the Conversion Agent may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor depositary. Every successor depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary and the Conversion Agent under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all rights, title and interest in the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts.

Such successor depositary may execute the Receipts either in the name of the predecessor depositary or in the name of the successor depositary.
(e)                     The provisions of this Section 5.04 as they apply to the Depositary and the Conversion Agent apply to the Registrar and Transfer Agent, as if specifically enumerated herein.
SECTION 5.05.   .
Notices, Reports and Documents
The Company agrees that it will deliver to the Depositary, the Calculation Agent and the Depositary will promptly after receipt of such notice, transmit to the record holders of Receipts, in each case at the address recorded in the Depositary's books, copies of all notices and reports generally made available by the Company to holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock and not
 
otherwise made publicly available. Such transmission will be at the Company's expense and the Company will provide the Depositary with such number of copies of such documents as the Depositary may reasonably request. In addition, the Depositary will transmit to the record holders of Receipts at the Company's expense such other documents as may be requested by the Company.
SECTION 5.06.  .
Indemnification by the Company
The Company shall indemnify the Depositary, the Calculation Agent, any Depositary's Agent and any Transfer Agent or Registrar against, and hold each of them harmless from, any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense (including the costs and expenses of defending itself) which may arise out of (i) acts performed or omitted in connection with this Deposit Agreement and the Receipts (a) by the Depositary, any Transfer Agent or Registrar or any of their respective agents (including any Depositary's Agent), except for any liability arising out of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction) on the respective parts of any such person or persons, or (b) by the Company or any of its agents, or (ii) the offer, sale or registration of the Receipts or shares of Stock pursuant to the provisions hereof. The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.06 shall survive the replacement, removal or resignation of any Depositary, Registrar, Transfer Agent or Depositary's Agent or termination of this Deposit Agreement. In no event shall the Depositary have any right of set off or counterclaim against the Depositary Shares or the Convertible Preferred Stock.
SECTION 5.07.  .
Fees, Charges and Expenses
No charges and expenses of the Depositary or any Depositary's Agent hereunder shall be payable by any person, except as provided in this Section 5.07. The Company shall pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of this Deposit Agreement.

Amendment
The form of the Receipts and any provision of this Deposit Agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between the Company and the Depositary without the consent of holders of Receipts in any respect that the Company and the Depositary may deem necessary or desirable; provided, however, that no such amendment (other than any change in the fees of any Depositary, Registrar or Transfer Agent that are payable by the Company) which imposes additional charges or materially and adversely alters any substantial existing right of the holders of Depositary Shares shall be effective unless such amendment shall have been approved by the holders of Receipts evidencing at least a majority of the affected Depositary Shares then outstanding. In no event shall any amendment impair the right, subject to the provisions of Section 2.05 and Article III, of any holder of any Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares to surrender any Receipt with instructions to the Depositary to deliver to the holder the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law. Every holder who retains or acquires Receipts after an amendment becomes effective shall be deemed, by continuing to hold such Receipt, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound by this Deposit Agreement as amended thereby.
SECTION 6.02.  .
Termination
(a)                    This Deposit Agreement may be terminated by the Company upon not less than 35 days' prior written notice to the Depositary, and the Depositary shall give notice of the termination to record holders of all outstanding Depositary Shares not less than 30 days' before the termination date.

This Deposit Agreement will automatically terminate if (i) all outstanding Depositary Shares shall have been converted in accordance with the provisions hereof or (ii) there shall have been made a final distribution in respect of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company and such distribution shall have been distributed to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto.
(b)                    Upon the termination of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall discontinue the transfer of Depositary Receipts, suspend the distribution of dividends and not give any further notices (other than notice of such termination) or perform any further acts, except that the Depositary will continue to collect dividends on the Preferred Stock and deliver such dividends along with the Convertible Preferred Stock certificates in exchange for Receipts surrendered. At any time after the expiration of three years from the date of termination, the Depositary may sell the Preferred Stock and hold the proceeds of such sale, without interest, for
 
the benefit of the record holders of Receipts who have not then surrendered their Receipts. After making such sale, the Depositary shall be discharged from all obligations under this Deposit Agreement, except to account for the proceeds of such sale.
(c)                    Upon the termination of this Deposit Agreement, the Company shall be discharged from all obligations under this Deposit Agreement except for its obligations to the Depositary, the Conversion Agent, any Depositary's Agent and any Transfer Agent or Registrar under Section 5.06 and Section 5.07.

As Representatives of the Several Underwriters,

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special tax counsel to Fifth Third Bancorp ("Fifth Third") in connection with the filing of the Prospectus Supplement dated as of June 18, 2008 pursuant to the Prospectus dated as of April 28, 2008, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the offer and sale by Fifth Third of 11,075,000 depositary shares, each representing l/250
th
of a 8.5% Series G Preferred Share, with a liquidation value per share of $25,000. The Prospectus Supplement is part of Fifth Third's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-141560), which was filed with the Commission on March 26, 2007, as amended on April 28, 2008.
We have reviewed copies of (1) the Prospectus Supplement and (2) such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth below. We have further assumed (i) that all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, (ii) with respect to all documents supplied to us as drafts, that the final, executed versions of such documents are identical in all material respects to the versions most recently supplied to us, (iii) that each such final version (when executed) is valid and enforceable in accordance with its terms, and (iv) that the Depositary Shares will be sold at the offering price stated on the cover of the Prospectus.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the discussion under the heading "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Prospectus Supplement constitutes a fair and accurate summary of the matters discussed therein in all material respects. In rendering this tax opinion, we have considered the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and Internal Revenue Service rulings, all of which are subject to change, which changes may be retroactively applied. A change in

the authorities upon which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions. There can be no assurance, moreover, that any of the opinions expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service, or, if challenged, by a court.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to Fifth Third's Form 8-K (which is deemed incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement) and to the references to this firm under the headings "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Validity of Securities" in the Registration Statement and Prospectus Supplement without admitting that we are "experts" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued thereunder, with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this exhibit. We do not undertake to advise you of any changes in the discussion under the heading "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" contained in the Registration Statement resulting from matters that might hereafter arise or be brought to our attention.
