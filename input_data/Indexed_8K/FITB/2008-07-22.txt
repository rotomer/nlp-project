Earnings Highlights
 
 
 
Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB) today reported a second quarter 2008 net loss of $202 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $286 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2008 and $376 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the same period in 2007.
Reported results included charges related to leveraged leases totaling $0.42 per share. In our 8-K filed on June 18, 2008, and previous filings, we noted that this charge was possible. Reported results included a charge of approximately $130 million pre-tax, or $0.16 per share after-tax, to reflect a projected change in the timing of tax benefits pursuant to FSP FAS 13-2, and an increase to tax expense of approximately $140 million, or $0.26 per share both pre-tax and after-tax, required for interest related to previous tax years pursuant to FIN 48. The actual charge in total was modestly lower than we previously estimated was possible if we determined a charge was necessary. Based on recent court decisions related to leveraged leases and current uncertainty regarding the outcome of our own case, we have concluded that previously recognized benefits from the transactions must be remeasured as required by FIN 48. We believe this charge addresses the remaining downside risk we have related to leveraged leases should there be a negative outcome in our case. We continue to believe that our tax treatment was proper under the tax law as it existed at the time the tax benefits were reported and that the facts in our case are different than other cases decided and support our position. Accordingly, we will continue to defend our leases in the courts. Additional discussion regarding this issue can be found later in this release. Reported results also included $13 million pre-tax, or $0.02 per share after-tax, in acquisition-related expenses.
On June 18, after evaluating a variety of potential credit scenarios through 2009, Fifth Third raised the Tier 1 capital ratio target range to 8 - 9 percent and issued $1.1 billion of additional capital in the form of convertible preferred securities. Additionally, given the outlook for a continued negative credit environment, the common dividend was reduced to conserve capital in current and future periods. The combination of those actions raised the Tier 1 ratio to 8.51%, the middle of the revised target range as of June 30, 2008.
"The capital actions we announced in June, combined with our expected strong core earnings growth and the anticipated sale of non-core businesses, significantly strengthens our capital position. We believe we have the capacity to withstand provision expense and losses in excess of stress scenarios we evaluated, creating a significant capital cushion to withstand unexpected developments. These actions reflect our commitment to protect the health and strength of the Bank, now and in the future," said Kevin T. Kabat, Chairman and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp.
"While we were disappointed in our overall results for the second quarter, which included a charge related to leveraged leases, they were largely in line with our expectations last month. Absent unexpected events, we anticipate returning to profitability in the third quarter.
"Non-performing assets and net charge-offs continued to increase reflecting weakening economic conditions. Deteriorating credit trends remain disproportionately attributable to commercial and residential real estate
 
loans, particularly in Florida and Michigan, and we continue to be very active in taking steps to address these issues that we and the industry are facing.
"Based on the decisive action we've taken, we believe we have the capacity to absorb future losses in excess of what we've modeled and are well-positioned relative to our peers. Throughout this economic downturn, we've maintained our focus on our long-term goals and objectives, and we continue to make investments in our businesses and execute on our strategic plans. As this quarter shows, we continued to produce strong operating results and we remain committed to posting bottom-line results that outperform the industry once this cycle turns."
Income Statement Highlights
 
Net interest income of $744 million on a taxable equivalent basis declined $82 million from the first quarter of 2008 largely due to the recalculation of cash flows on certain leveraged lease transactions that reduced net interest income by approximately $130 million. Excluding this charge, net interest income increased by $48 million, or 6 percent, from the previous quarter. Net interest income benefited from lower funding costs on core deposits and wholesale borrowings, a steeper yield curve and lower balances in higher priced consumer certificates of deposit (CD). This more than offset the effect of
 
lower asset yields, the issuance of additional wholesale funding and higher loan interest reversals and nonaccrual balances in the quarter. Net interest income included the benefit of $31 million in accretion and amortization of fair value purchase accounting adjustments related to First Charter Corporation (First Charter). It is expected that net interest income will continue to benefit from this effect in coming quarters. The reported net interest margin was 3.04 percent, down 37 bps from the first quarter of 2008. Excluding the impact of the leveraged lease litigation, net interest margin was 3.57 percent, a 16 bp increase from the previous quarter. The accretion and amortization of First Charter purchase accounting adjustments provided a 13 bp benefit to the net interest margin, with the additional improvement due to lower core deposit and wholesale funding costs.
Compared with the second quarter of 2007, net interest income was flat and net interest margin declined 33 bps from 3.37 percent due to the impact of the charge related to our leveraged lease litigation. Excluding the impact of the leveraged lease litigation charges, net interest income increased by $129 million, or 17 percent, from the same period in 2007, and net interest margin expanded 20 bps. The increase in net interest income reflected average earning asset growth of 11 percent and 25 bps of widening in the net interest rate spread.
Average Loans
 
Average portfolio loan and lease balances grew 3 percent sequentially and 11 percent from the second quarter of 2007 with approximately 1 percent of the sequential growth and 3 percent of the year-over-year growth attributable to acquisitions. Average commercial loans and leases grew 8 percent sequentially and 20 percent compared with the previous year. Growth was primarily driven by commercial and industrial (C&I) lending, up 12 percent sequentially and 31 percent versus a year ago, reflecting solid production across most of our footprint and the effect of acquisitions while approximately $1.0 billion, or 4 percent, of sequential growth in C&I loans was due to commercial loans held for sale reclassified to portfolio loans during the quarter. Compared with last quarter, commercial mortgage balances increased $574 million and commercial construction balances grew by $123 million. The acquisition of First Charter contributed $179 million and $114 million, respectively. Consumer loan and lease balances declined 3 percent sequentially and were flat from
 
the second quarter of 2007. Excluding balances from acquisitions, average consumer loans were down 4 percent sequentially and 5 percent year-over-year. Sequentially, growth in home equity and credit card loans was more than offset by declines in auto, primarily due to first quarter of 2008 sales and securitizations, and residential mortgage loans. On a year-over-year basis, growth in credit card and residential mortgage loans offset a decline in auto loans. Almost all of the year-over-year growth in residential mortgage loan balances was due to the fourth quarter of 2007 acquisition of R-G Crown. In the first quarter of 2008, the Bancorp securitized and sold $2.7 billion in auto loans. During the second quarter of 2008, the Bancorp sold approximately $523 million of residential mortgage portfolio loans.
Average Deposits
 
 
Average core deposits were down 2 percent sequentially and up 3 percent from the second quarter of 2007. Excluding acquisitions, core deposits declined 3 percent for the quarter and were relatively unchanged from the previous year. Transaction deposits (excluding consumer time deposits) grew 1 percent from the first quarter and 6 percent from a year ago. The sequential growth and 2 percent of the year-over-year growth were attributable to acquisitions. The decline in core deposits compared to the first quarter of 2008 was driven by lower foreign office commercial sweep deposits, interest checking, money market and consumer CD balances which more than offset growth in demand deposit account (DDA) and savings balances. On a year-over-year basis, growth in DDA, savings, money market and foreign office deposits balances more than offset lower interest checking and consumer CD balances. The decline in consumer CD balances in the second quarter of 2008 reflected unusually high competitor pricing in many of our markets and our determination that such pricing was not reflective of the value of these deposits.
Retail core deposits decreased 1 percent sequentially and were relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2007. Comparisons for both periods reflect an increase in net new accounts offset by lower average account balances. Commercial core deposits decreased 3 percent sequentially and increased 7 percent year-over-year.
 
The $2.3 billion sequential increase in jumbo CDs resulted from actions taken early in the second quarter to extend the average duration of wholesale borrowings to reduce exposure to high levels of market volatility.
Noninterest Income
 
Noninterest income of $722 million declined $142 million sequentially and increased $53 million, or 8 percent, from a year ago. First quarter of 2008 results included a $273 million gain resulting from the Visa IPO, partially offset by a $152 million pre-tax charge to reduce the cash surrender value of one of our Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) policies. Excluding the impact of Visa and BOLI in the first quarter and net securities gains/losses in both the first and second quarters of 2008, noninterest income increased $18 million, or 3 percent, from the previous quarter. Year-over-year growth in noninterest income of 8 percent was driven by strong growth in payments processing revenue, deposit fees, corporate banking revenue and mortgage banking revenue.
Electronic payment processing (EPP) revenue of $235 million increased 10 percent sequentially and 15 percent from a year ago driven by continued strong merchant processing results, up 16 percent. Card issuer interchange revenue increased 20 percent from the previous year, driven by higher debit and credit card usage and an increase in the average dollar amount per debit card transaction. Financial institutions revenue grew 10 percent from the second quarter of 2007.
Service charges on deposits of $159 million increased 8 percent sequentially and 12 percent compared with the same quarter last year. Retail service charges increased 12 percent from the first quarter and 7 percent from the second quarter of 2007. Both sequential and year-over-year comparisons reflect strong growth in net new accounts and higher deposits fees. Commercial service charges increased 4 percent sequentially and 19 percent compared with last year. This growth primarily reflects the effect of lower market interest rates, as reduced earnings credit rates paid to customers have resulted in higher realized net use of services fees to pay for treasury management services.
Corporate banking revenue of $111 million increased 3 percent sequentially and 26 percent year-over-year. Revenue growth for both periods was driven by broad-based strength, with particularly strong growth in foreign exchange revenue, up 10 percent sequentially and 79 percent from the same period in 2007, institutional sales revenue, up 4 percent sequentially and 35 percent year-over-year, and business lending
 
fees, up 8 percent sequentially and 23 percent from the second quarter of 2007. Strong results continue to be driven by more volatile markets and increased penetration of the Company's middle market customer base.
Investment advisory revenue of $92 million was down 1 percent sequentially and 5 percent from the second quarter of 2007. Institutional trust revenue decreased 1 percent sequentially and 6 percent year-over-year largely due to market value declines. Mutual fund fees were up 1 percent sequentially and down 10 percent year-over-year resulting from market volatility. Brokerage fee revenue was up 1 percent sequentially and down 12 percent from the second quarter of 2007 reflecting the continued shift in assets from equity products to money market funds and a decline in transaction-based revenues.
Mortgage banking net revenue totaled $86 million in the second quarter of 2008, an $11 million decline from strong first quarter results and a $45 million increase from the second quarter of 2007. Second quarter originations were $3.3 billion, a decline of 17 percent from the previous quarter, due to rising interest rates and lower commensurate application volumes and originations in the latter half of the quarter. Second quarter originations resulted in gains on the sale of mortgages of $79 million compared to gains of $93 million during the previous quarter and $25 million during the same period in 2007. Revenue for the second quarter included $9 million related to gains on the sale of portfolio loans compared with $11 million in the previous quarter and $2 million in the second quarter of 2007. The first quarter of 2008 adoption of FAS 159 for mortgage banking contributed $17 million of the year-over-year increase in mortgage banking revenue and additional origination costs recorded in other noninterest expense. Net servicing revenue, before mortgage servicing rights (MSR) valuation adjustments, totaled $11 million in the second quarter, compared with $8 million last quarter and $13 million a year ago. MSR valuation adjustments, including mark-to-market related adjustments on free-standing derivatives, represented a net loss of $4 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared with a net loss of $3 million last quarter and a net gain of $3 million a year ago. The mortgage-servicing asset, net of valuation reserve, was $697 million at quarter end on a servicing portfolio of $38.7 billion.
Net losses on investment securities were $10 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared with net gains of $27 million last quarter.
Other noninterest income totaled $49 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared with $177 million last quarter and $96 million in the second quarter of 2007. Second quarter 2007 results included a $16 million gain on the sale of non-strategic credit card accounts. Last quarter's results included a $273 million gain resulting from the Visa IPO, a charge of $152 million related to the decrease in the cash surrender value of one of the Bancorp's BOLI policies, $26 million in hedge and other losses associated with the sale of auto loans and $15 million in gains on sale from auto securitization transactions. The year-over-year decline in other noninterest income was driven by approximately $20 million in write-downs on other real estate owned (OREO) properties in the second quarter of 2008 as well as the credit card gain a year ago.
 
Noninterest Expense
 
Noninterest expense of $858 million increased by $143 million sequentially and $93 million from a year ago. Second quarter results included $13 million in acquisition-related expenses as a result of the First Charter and First Horizon acquisitions during the quarter. First quarter results included the reversal of $152 million in Visa litigation reserves, $9 million in severance-related costs, $7 million in acquisition-related expenses due to the acquisition of R-G Crown and $18 million of seasonally higher FICA and unemployment expenses. Excluding the aforementioned items, noninterest expense increased $12 million, or 1 percent, from the first quarter of 2008. Expense growth was primarily related to volume-related processing and technology investment expense. The increase in noninterest expense compared with the second quarter of 2007 was driven by higher costs due to acquisitions, increased loan and lease processing costs as a result of collections activities, increased provision for unfunded commitments, as well as increased franchise and other taxes as a result of the impact of the favorable settlement of certain tax audits in the second quarter of 2007. Additionally, $8 million of the year-over-year increase in other noninterest expense was related to increased FDIC insurance expense which previously was offset by prior insurance premium credits.
Credit Quality
 
 
Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 166 bps in the second quarter, compared with 137 bps in the first quarter of 2008 and 55 bps in the second quarter of 2007. Loss experience continues to be concentrated in Michigan and Florida and primarily related to consumer residential real estate loans as well as commercial loans to residential real estate builders and developers. Michigan and Florida represented approximately 44 percent of total second quarter net charge-offs. Residential real estate losses were 34 percent of total net charge-offs. Losses on loans to residential real estate builders and developers represent 10 percent of total losses.
Consumer net charge-offs of $167 million, or 204 bps, grew $32 million from the first quarter of 2008, driven primarily by losses in the residential real estate portfolio. Net charge-offs in Michigan and Florida represented 48 percent of consumer losses in the second quarter, in line with results from the first quarter of 2008. Home equity net charge-offs of $54 million increased $13 million compared with last quarter, primarily due to increased losses on brokered home equity loans reflecting borrower stress and lower home price valuations. Originations of these brokered loans was discontinued last year. Net losses on brokered home equity loans were $28 million, or 51 percent, of second quarter home equity losses. Brokered home equity loans represented $2.4 billion, or 20 percent, of the total home equity portfolio of $12.4 billion. Michigan and Florida represented 42 percent of second quarter home equity losses. Net charge-offs within the residential mortgage portfolio were $63 million, an increase of $29 million, primarily a result of declining property values on loans in foreclosure, with losses in Michigan and Florida representing 72 percent of losses in the second quarter. Net charge-offs in the auto portfolio declined by $9 million from the first quarter to $26 million. Net charge-offs on consumer credit card loans were $21 million, up $1 million from the first quarter. During the quarter, we adjusted our credit card charge-off policy related to bankruptcies to conform with industry standards and to increase the likelihood of recoveries and customer affirmation of Fifth Third in bankruptcy proceedings. Credit card charge-offs would have been $4 million higher absent this change.
Commercial net charge-offs of $177 million, or 141 bps, increased $36 million compared with the first quarter of 2008. Losses related to residential real estate builders and developers represented $34 million, or 19 percent, of commercial net charge-offs. Commercial construction net charge-offs decreased to $49 million from $72 million the previous quarter driven by lower losses in Michigan. Michigan and Florida accounted for 61 percent of these losses in the second quarter. Commercial mortgage net charge-offs decreased to $21 million, down $12 million from the first quarter of 2008. Michigan and Florida accounted for 58 percent of
 
 
these losses. Net charge-offs in the C&I portfolio were $107 million, up $71 million from the first quarter of 2008. This increase was driven by a $23 million charge-off in Illinois as well as particular weakness among businesses associated with residential construction activities.
Provision for loan and lease losses totaled $719 million in the second quarter of 2008, exceeding net charge-offs by $375 million. The increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and allowance for loan and lease losses was largely driven by higher inherent losses resulting from deterioration in residential real estate collateral values, particularly in the residential homebuilder and developer portfolios and consumer residential real estate portfolios, and negative trends in nonperforming and other criticized assets.
The allowance for loan and lease losses represented 1.85 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of quarter end, compared with 1.49 percent last quarter and 1.06 percent in the same quarter last year.
 
 
 
 
 
Nonperforming assets (NPAs) at quarter end were $2.2 billion, or 2.56 percent of total loans and leases and OREO, up from 1.96 percent last quarter and 0.70 percent in the second quarter a year ago. Sequential growth in NPAs was $606 million, or 38 percent, down from 50 percent growth in the first quarter. Second quarter growth was driven by increases related to residential real estate builders and developers in the commercial portfolio and restructurings of mortgage and home equity loans in the consumer portfolio.
Commercial NPAs of $1.5 billion, or 2.93 percent, grew $465 million, or 44 percent, in the second quarter of 2008. Commercial NPA growth was primarily driven by continued deterioration in the commercial construction and commercial mortgage portfolios, particularly in Michigan and Florida. NPAs in the C&I portfolio of $414 million, increased $109 million, from the previous quarter, driven by a $20 million increase in residential homebuilder and developer NPAs and weakness among customers associated with residential construction activities. Commercial construction NPAs were $552 million, an increase of $133 million from the first quarter of 2008. Commercial mortgage NPAs were $540 million, a sequential increase of $216 million. Commercial
 
real estate loans in Michigan and Florida represented 42 percent of our total commercial real estate portfolio. Increases in NPAs in these states represented 74 percent of commercial real estate NPA growth and these regions accounted for 68 percent of total commercial real estate NPAs. Residential real estate builders and developers represented approximately $547 million in commercial NPAs and increased $239 million from the first quarter of 2008, accounting for approximately half of the increase in total commercial NPAs.
Consumer NPAs of $674 million, or 2.00 percent, increased $141 million, or 26 percent, in the second quarter of 2008. Of the growth, $136 million was experienced in residential real estate portfolios. Residential mortgage NPAs increased $115 million to $448 million. Of residential mortgage NPAs, $12 million were in residential construction loans (of which $7 million was OREO). Home equity NPAs increased $21 million to $183 million. OREO represented $119 million of total residential mortgage NPAs and $32 million in total home equity NPAs. Residential real estate loans in Michigan and Florida represented 64 percent of the growth in residential real estate NPAs, 59 percent of total residential real estate NPAs, and 36 percent of total residential real estate loans. Included within consumer NPAs, primarily in residential real estate loans, were $318 million in troubled debt restructurings, including $146 million restructured in the second quarter of 2008. These debt restructurings assist qualifying borrowers in creating workable payment plans to enable them to remain in their homes.
Loans still accruing over 90 days past due were $605 million, up $67 million or 12 percent, from the first quarter of 2008. Consumer 90 days past due balances increased 10 percent from the previous quarter and commercial 90 days past due balances increased 15 percent. Growth in commercial and consumer 90 days past dues was generally concentrated in commercial real estate and residential mortgages.
Capital Position/Other
 
 
During the second quarter, we issued $400 million in trust-preferred securities and $750 million of five-year senior notes. On June 18, 2008, we announced a plan to raise our target for the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8-9%. In conjunction with this plan, we issued $1.1 billion in convertible preferred securities which raised our Tier 1 ratio to the middle of our target range, We also announced a reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share from the prior $0.44 level, which conserves approximately $1.2 billion of common equity by the end of 2009 relative to the previous dividend level. Additionally, we announced our intention to sell certain non-core businesses, which we expects to generate more than $1 billion on an after-tax basis.
 
The tangible equity ratio increased 18 bps to 6.37 percent primarily due to the issuance of the convertible preferred securities, which contributed 96 bps to the ratio. The Tier 1 capital ratio increased 79 bps to 8.51 and the total capital ratio increased 81 bps, primarily due to the convertible preferred issuance which contributed 93 bps to both Tier 1 and Total capital.
As previously disclosed, Fifth Third filed suit against the IRS seeking a refund of taxes paid as a result of the audit of the 1997 tax year. This suit involves a determination of the correct tax treatment of certain leveraged leases entered into by the Company. The outcome of this litigation will likely impact a number of leveraged leases we entered into during 1997 through 2004. After a jury trial, the jury rendered a verdict in the form of answers to interrogatories, some of which favored Fifth Third and some of which favored the IRS. No judgment has been entered by the Court in the case and the parties dispute the judgment that should be entered in light of the jury's responses to the interrogatories. Both the IRS and Fifth Third will be filing briefs, after which the Court will enter a judgment. The nature and timing of the Court's decision is uncertain. During the second quarter of 2008, two other decisions involving the tax treatment of leveraged leases were issued where the courts ruled in favor of the IRS. To date, the decisions issued have been dependent on the specific facts in each case. We continue to believe that the facts and circumstances related to our leveraged leases are different from these other cases, that our tax treatment was proper under the tax law as it existed at the time the tax benefits were reported, and that the facts in our case support our position. We are required under applicable accounting standards to assess the likeliness of a favorable outcome of this litigation. In light of recent decisions and uncertainty related to our own case, we have concluded that previously recognized benefits from the transactions at issue in the litigation and certain other leveraged leases described above must be remeasured as required by FIN 48 and have recorded the charges described earlier. We believe these charges address the downside risk we have related to leveraged leases should there be a negative outcome in our case. We intend to continue pursuing a favorable disposition of this matter.
On May 5, 2008, we completed our acquisition of nine branches from First Horizon National Corporation, assuming their deposits. First Horizon retained all loans held at the branches. Additionally, on June 6, 2008, we completed our acquisition of First Charter Corporation, paying $31.00 per First Charter share, or approximately $1.1 billion. This transaction reduced tangible equity capital ratios by approximately 65 bps.
Outlook
The following outlook represents currently expected full year 2008 growth rates compared with full year 2007 results. Note that the current outlook includes the effect of the second quarter acquisitions of First Charter and branches from First Horizon, not previously included in the outlook. Our outlook is based on current expectations as of the date of this release for results within our businesses; prevailing views related to economic growth, inflation, unemployment and other economic factors, and market forward interest rate expectations. These expectations are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these expectations,
 
including the effects of unusually high market volatility and factors contributing to industry-wide and company-specific credit losses. We undertake no obligation to update these expectations after the date of this release. Please refer to the forward-looking statement at the end of this release for important information regarding risk factors related to current and future results.
