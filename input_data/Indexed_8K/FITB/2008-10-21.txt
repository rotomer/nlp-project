Earnings Highlights
 
 
NM: not meaningful
Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB) today reported a third quarter 2008 net loss of $56 million. This represented a net loss to common shareholders of $81 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $202 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2008 and net income of $325 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007. The third quarter 2008 net loss to common shareholders includes $25 million in preferred stock dividends. Reported results included: a $51 million pre-tax, or $0.06 per share after-tax, charge due to the impairment of preferred stock held in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; an estimated non-cash charge of $45 million pre-tax, or $0.05 per share after-tax, related to Visa's settlement with Discover; and an estimated non-cash charge of $27 million pre-tax, or $0.04 per share after-tax, to lower the current cash surrender value of one of our Bank-Owned Life Insurance ("BOLI") policies. Results also included a net benefit of $40 million pre-tax, or $0.05 per share after-tax, related to the satisfactory resolution of a court case stemming from goodwill created in a prior acquisition.
"The banking industry has experienced unprecedented developments in recent weeks," said Kevin T. Kabat, Chairman, President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "These events have a variety of causes. The headline issues  subprime lending, option ARMs, credit default swaps, CDOs  involve products that Fifth Third has not engaged in. Nor do we have significant exposures to troubled financial counterparties who have been in the news. As our results indicate, we are not immune to disruptions in the capital markets and weakening economic conditions. Higher credit costs once again drove bottom line results that no one here is satisfied with. Non-performing assets and net charge-offs continued to increase and remain disproportionately attributable to commercial and residential real estate loans, particularly in Florida and Eastern Michigan.
Despite the difficult economic backdrop, the core earnings power of the Bank remains positive. Our businesses continue to produce revenue growth and our disciplined approach to expense control allows us to efficiently operate our businesses.
We announced a capital plan in June that anticipated significant uncertainty in the economic outlook and was devised to provide us with the ability to withstand additional negative developments. This plan involved, first, an increase in our targeted capital ratios, including a Tier 1 capital ratio target of 8-9 percent, a range we expect continually to meet or exceed and which is significantly in excess of regulatory "well-capitalized" levels. Second, the issuance of $1.1 billion in Tier 1 securities, which placed Fifth Third solidly within its target capital ranges. Third, the reduction of our common dividend, which preserves over $1.2 billion in equity through the end of 2009 relative to our prior dividend level.
The remaining element of our capital plan involved adding $1 billion or more to capital through the sale of non-core assets to provide for the possibility of a difficult 2009, a view that continues to seem likely to us. During the past quarter, we have made significant progress in evaluating attractive structures, gauging significant interest on the part of potential investors, and negotiating potential transactions.
 
Last week, however, the U.S. Treasury outlined a plan that would involve the purchase of Tier 1 securities from eligible financial institutions. We support this plan, which we believe represents an effective method to achieve the goals of increasing credit availability while at the same time providing a firmer capital foundation for U.S. banks. Nine institutions have participated initially and we expect many additional competitors to also avail themselves of this program.
We are in the process of evaluating this opportunity and considering an application. The terms of this capital, and our desire to ensure that we maintain strong capital levels, not only in absolute terms but also relative to competitors, will be factors in our decision. We would also expect to reevaluate our plans and activities with respect to pursuing a current sale of non-core assets as part of our capital plan. We believe that either alternative would provide capital well in excess of our capital targets.
Regardless of our course of action, we will continue to evaluate our businesses from a strategic planning perspective and will make decisions in the context of what's best for our investors and customers. We retain significant flexibility as we evaluate our businesses and opportunities that may present themselves in a significantly changing financial services landscape."
Income Statement Highlights
 
NM: not meaningful
 
Net Interest Income
 
Net interest income of $1.1 billion on a taxable equivalent basis was up $324 million from the second quarter of 2008. Third quarter net interest income included the benefit of $215 million from fair value purchase accounting adjustments for loan discount accretion related to the second quarter 2008 acquisition of First Charter Corporation ("First Charter"). The impact of loan discount accretion in the second quarter 2008 was $31 million. As previously disclosed, cash flow recalculations on certain leveraged lease transactions reduced second quarter 2008 net interest income by approximately $130 million. Excluding the leveraged lease charge in the second quarter and the effects of the loan discount accretion in both quarters, net interest income increased $11 million from the second quarter 2008. Net interest income benefited from a lower effective federal funds rate, an increase in LIBOR rates and higher securities balances, which more than offset higher costs associated with a shift toward higher cost deposits and unusually wide spreads on wholesale funding sources, an increase in loan interest reversals, and higher nonaccrual balances.
Reported net interest margin was 4.24 percent, up 120 bps from 3.04 percent in the second quarter of 2008. The increase was primarily due to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, which contributed 85 bps to the third quarter margin versus 13 bps to the second quarter margin, and the negative impact of 53 bps to the second quarter margin of the leveraged lease charge. Excluding the impact of these items, net interest margin was 3.39 percent and declined 5 bps from the previous quarter. The decline was driven by a shift to higher cost deposits and a transition to longer term institutional and commercial CDs, as the Bank continues to manage its exposure to overnight funding sources.
Compared with the third quarter of 2007, net interest income was up $308 million and net interest margin increased 90 bps from 3.34 percent primarily due to the impact of loan discount accretion from the First Charter acquisition. Excluding this item, net interest income increased by $94 million, or 12 percent, from the same period in 2007, and net interest margin expanded 5 bps. The increase in net interest income reflected average earning asset growth of 11 percent.
 
Average Loans
 
Average portfolio loan and lease balances grew 1 percent sequentially and 11 percent from the third quarter of 2007. Excluding acquisitions, portfolio loan and lease balances declined 1 percent sequentially and increased 6 percent from the previous year. Average commercial loans and leases grew 2 percent sequentially and 21 percent compared with the previous year. Sequential growth was driven almost entirely by the full quarter impact on average balances from the First Charter acquisition, which contributed $688 million to average commercial mortgage balances and $548 million to average commercial construction balances in the third quarter. Excluding all acquisitions, commercial loan growth was flat sequentially and increased 17 percent from the previous year. Year-over-year growth excluding acquisitions was primarily driven by commercial and industrial (C&I) lending, up 26 percent versus a year ago, primarily the result of strong production during the first and second quarters of 2008. Period end loans included $1.4 billion of commercial loans primarily due to the use of contingent liquidity facilities related to certain off-balance sheet programs.
Consumer loan and lease balances increased 1 percent sequentially and declined 1 percent from the third quarter of 2007. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, average consumer loans decreased 2 percent sequentially and 8 percent year-over-year. Sequentially, growth in high FICO, low loan-to-value (LTV) home equity loans and credit card loans was more than offset by declines in auto and residential mortgage loans. On a year-over-year basis, growth in home equity, credit card and residential mortgage loans was offset by a reduction in auto loan balances due to the securitization of $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2008. All of the year-over-year growth in residential mortgage loan balances was due to the fourth quarter 2007 acquisition of R-G Crown and the second quarter 2008 acquisition of First Charter.
 
Average Deposits
 
Average core deposits were flat sequentially and up 3 percent from the third quarter of 2007. Excluding acquisitions, average core deposits declined 2 percent both from the previous quarter and the previous year. Average transaction deposits (excluding consumer time deposits) were down 3 percent from the second quarter and grew 3 percent from a year ago. Sequential growth in average demand deposit accounts (DDA) and consumer CD balances was offset by lower interest checking, savings and money market deposits, and foreign office commercial sweep deposits. On a year-over-year basis, growth in DDA, savings, consumer CD and foreign office commercial sweep deposits more than offset lower interest checking and money market balances.
Retail average core deposits increased 1 percent sequentially and were up 3 percent from the third quarter of 2007. Sequential growth in DDA and consumer CD balances was partially offset by lower interest checking, savings, and money market balances. The sequential decline in interest-bearing transaction accounts reflects lower average account balances as economic conditions have weakened. Commercial core deposits decreased 1 percent sequentially and increased 5 percent year-over-year. Sequential growth in DDA and interest checking account balances was more than offset by lower savings and money market account balances.
The $3.5 billion sequential increase in CDs $100,000 and over reflects actions we have undertaken beginning in the second quarter of 2008 to extend the average duration of wholesale borrowings to reduce exposure to high levels of market volatility in overnight markets.
 
Noninterest Income
 
Noninterest income of $717 million decreased $5 million sequentially and increased $36 million from a year ago. Third quarter results included a $76 million gain related to a satisfactory resolution of a court case related to goodwill stemming from a previous acquisition. (Legal expenses of $36 million associated with this case are recorded in noninterest expense.) Results also included a $51 million other-than-temporary impairment charge on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock and a non-cash estimated charge of $27 million to lower the current cash surrender value of one of our BOLI policies. Excluding these items, noninterest income declined $3 million from a strong second quarter, driven primarily by lower mortgage banking revenue partially offset by higher deposit service charges and a $22 million gain on non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights. Third quarter 2007 results included a gain of $15 million on the sale of FDIC deposit insurance credits and a $16 million gain on the sale of certain non-strategic credit card accounts. Excluding these items in the third quarter of 2007, investment securities gains, and the gain from the litigation settlement and the BOLI charge in the third quarter of 2008, noninterest income increased by $92 million, or 14 percent from the previous year. Year-over-year growth in noninterest income was driven by growth in payments processing revenue, deposit fees, corporate banking revenue and mortgage banking revenue.
Electronic payment processing (EPP) revenue of $235 million was unchanged sequentially and increased 11 percent from a year ago. Merchant processing revenue was up 9 percent from the previous year, reflecting continued solid account acquisition offset by lower volumes due to a reduction in retailer same-store sales. Card issuer interchange revenue increased 19 percent from the previous year, driven by an increased number of debit and credit card transactions and an increase in the average dollar amount per debit card transaction. Financial institutions revenue grew 6 percent from the third quarter of 2007 driven by higher transaction volumes.
Service charges on deposits of $172 million increased 8 percent sequentially and 13 percent compared with the same quarter last year. Retail service charges increased 11 percent from the second quarter and 8 percent from the third quarter of 2007, due to lower average balances and increased deposit fees. Commercial service charges increased 3 percent sequentially and 21 percent compared with last year. This growth primarily reflects the effect of lower market interest rates, as reduced earnings credit rates paid to customers have resulted in higher realized net services fees used to pay for treasury management services.
 
Corporate banking revenue of $104 million decreased 6 percent sequentially from strong second quarter results and was up 15 percent from the previous year. Solid sequential growth in foreign exchange fees and institutional sales, each up 5 percent, was more than offset by declines in interest rate derivative revenue, down 38 percent, and business lending fees, down 15 percent. Corporate banking revenue growth on a year-over-year basis was primarily driven by strong growth in foreign exchange revenue, up 77 percent, institutional sales revenue, up 21 percent, and business lending fees, up 11 percent. Results continue to be driven by market volatility and increased product penetration into our middle market customer base.
Investment advisory revenue of $90 million was down 2 percent sequentially and 5 percent from the third quarter of 2007. Institutional trust revenue decreased 1 percent from the same period the previous year largely driven by lower market values. Mutual fund fees were down 6 percent year-over-year, as market volatility drove declines from the previous year. Brokerage fee revenue was down 16 percent from the third quarter of 2007 reflecting the continued shift in assets from equity products to money market funds due to extreme market volatility, as well as a decline in transaction-based revenues.
Mortgage banking net revenue totaled $45 million in the third quarter of 2008, a $41 million decline from strong second quarter results and a $19 million increase from the third quarter of 2007. Third quarter originations were $2.0 billion, down from $3.3 billion the previous quarter, due to lower application volumes as a result of market disruptions and interest rates that were generally higher during the quarter. Third quarter originations resulted in fees and gains on the sale of mortgages of $43 million compared with gains of $79 million during the previous quarter and $9 million during the same period in 2007. Revenue for the third quarter included $8 million related to gains on the sale of portfolio loans compared with $9 million in the previous quarter and $2 million in the third quarter of 2007. The first quarter of 2008 adoption of FAS 159 for mortgage banking contributed $11 million of the year-over-year increase in mortgage banking revenue, with corresponding origination costs recorded in noninterest expense. Net servicing revenue, before mortgage servicing rights (MSR) valuation adjustments, totaled $17 million in the third quarter, compared with $11 million last quarter and $14 million a year ago. MSR valuation adjustments, including mark-to-market related adjustments on free-standing derivatives, represented a net loss of $15 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared with a net loss of $4 million last quarter and a net gain of $3 million a year ago. The mortgage-servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $683 million at quarter end on a servicing portfolio of $39.8 billion.
Net securities gains of $22 million were recorded in the third quarter on non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights which offset MSR valuation adjustments, compared with no gains in the previous quarter or in the same period the previous year.
 
Net losses on investment securities were $63 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared with a net loss of $10 million last quarter. We recorded an other-than-temporary-impairment charge on the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock ownership, which accounted for $51 million of these losses compared with $13 million in charges last quarter. These assets are now carried at $4 million on a combined basis on an original par value of $69 million.
Other noninterest income totaled $112 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared with $49 million last quarter and $93 million in the third quarter of 2007. Third quarter 2008 results included the $76 million gain related to the litigation settlement stemming from a prior acquisition and the $27 million charge that lowered the current cash surrender value of one of our BOLI policies. Excluding these items, other noninterest income increased by $14 million from the previous quarter driven by lower write-downs on other real estate owned (OREO) properties. Excluding the gain from the court case and the BOLI charge in the third quarter of 2008 and the gain on the sale of FDIC deposit insurance credits and certain non-strategic credit card accounts in the third quarter of 2007, other non-interest income was relatively unchanged from the previous year.
Noninterest Expense
 
Noninterest expense of $967 million increased $109 million sequentially and $114 million from a year ago. Third quarter results included an estimated $45 million charge due to Visa's pending settlement with Discover, $36 million related to legal expenses associated with the litigation settlement from a prior acquisition, and $7 million in additional pension settlement expense, the same amount that was recorded in the third quarter of the previous year. Second quarter 2008 results included $13 million in expenses related to the acquisition of First Charter and branches from First Horizon and $12 million in sequentially additional operating expenses from acquisitions. Third quarter 2007 results included a $78 million charge due to Visa's settlement with American Express. On a year-over-year comparison basis, acquisitions have added approximately $31 million of additional operating expense compared with the prior year and the impact of the adoption of FAS 159 on the classification of mortgage origination costs has added approximately $11 million. Excluding these items, noninterest expense increased $15 million, or 2 percent, from the second quarter of 2008 and increased $69 million, or 9 percent, from the third quarter of 2007. Expense growth on a sequential basis was primarily attributable to volume-related processing and technology investment expense. The increase in noninterest expense compared with the third quarter of 2007 was driven by increased loan and lease processing costs as a result of increased collections activities, increased provision for unfunded commitments, and higher volume-related payments processing expense.
 
Credit Quality
 
Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 217 bps in the third quarter, compared with 166 bps in the second quarter of 2008 and 60 bps in the third quarter of 2007. Loss experience continues to be primarily associated with consumer residential real estate loans and commercial residential builder and developer loans, and to be disproportionately concentrated in Michigan and Florida. These states represented approximately 65 percent of total third quarter net charge-offs. Of total net charge-offs, 35 percent related to residential builders and developers and 29 percent related to residential real estate. Excluding losses on loans to homebuilders and developers of $163 million in the third quarter and $34 million the previous quarter, net charge-offs decreased by $10 million.
Commercial net charge-offs of $267 million, or 207 bps, increased $90 million compared with the second quarter of 2008. Losses related to residential builders and developers were $163 million and increased $129 million from the second quarter and represented 61 percent of commercial net charge-offs. Of total residential real estate builder and developer net charge-offs, $9 million were C&I losses, $75 million were commercial construction losses, and $79 million were commercial mortgage losses. Commercial construction net charge-offs increased to $88 million from $49 in the second quarter. Michigan and Florida accounted for approximately 86 percent of these losses in the third quarter and more than all of the sequential increase. Commercial mortgage net charge-offs increased to $94 million, up $73 million from the second quarter of 2008. Michigan and Florida accounted for approximately 87 percent of these losses and approximately 95 percent of the sequential growth. Net charge-offs in the C&I portfolio were $85 million, down $22 million from the second quarter of 2008. Excluding the previously disclosed $25 million loss related to fraud in the second quarter of 2008, C&I losses were relatively flat.
 
Consumer net charge-offs of $196 million, or 233 bps, grew $29 million from the second quarter of 2008, driven primarily by losses in the residential real estate portfolio. Net charge-offs in Michigan and Florida represented 52 percent of consumer losses in the third quarter, up from 48 percent in the second quarter of 2008. Home equity net charge-offs of $55 million increased $1 million and continued to be driven by brokered home equity loans reflecting borrower stress and lower home price valuations. Originations of these brokered loans were discontinued last year. Net losses on brokered home equity loans were $30 million or 54 percent of third quarter home equity losses. Brokered home equity loans represented $2.4 billion, or 19 percent, of the total home equity portfolio of $12.6 billion. Michigan and Florida represented 40 percent of third quarter home equity losses. Net charge-offs within the residential mortgage portfolio were $77 million, an increase of $14 million from the previous quarter, primarily a result of declining property values on loans in foreclosure, with losses in Michigan and Florida representing 85 percent of losses in the third quarter. Net charge-offs in the auto portfolio increased by $6 million from the second quarter to $32 million, driven by seasonality and lower values received on larger vehicles at auction. Net charge-offs on consumer credit card loans were $24 million, up $3 million from the second quarter, as the portfolio continues to mature.
 
Provision for loan and lease losses totaled $941 million in the third quarter of 2008, exceeding net charge-offs by $478 million. The increase in the provision for loan and lease losses as well as the corresponding increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was largely driven by higher estimates of inherent losses resulting from deterioration in residential real estate collateral values, particularly in the residential homebuilder and developer and consumer residential real estate portfolios, and negative trends in nonperforming and other criticized assets.
The allowance for loan and lease losses represented 2.41 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of quarter end, compared with 1.85 percent last quarter, and represented 79 percent of nonperforming loans, the same percentage as the previous quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
Nonperforming assets (NPAs) at quarter end were $2.8 billion, or 3.30 percent of total loans and leases and OREO, up from 2.57 percent last quarter and 0.92 percent in the third quarter a year ago. Sequential growth in NPAs was $628 million, or 29 percent, down from 38 percent growth in the second quarter. Third quarter growth was driven by increases related to residential real estate builders and developers in the commercial portfolio and restructurings of mortgage and home equity loans in the consumer portfolio.
Commercial NPAs of $2.0 billion, or 3.79 percent, grew $464 million, or 30 percent, from the second quarter of 2008. Commercial NPA growth was primarily driven by continued deterioration in the commercial construction and commercial mortgage portfolios, particularly in the residential builder and developer portfolio and particularly in Michigan and Florida. Residential real estate builder and developer NPAs were $702 million in the third quarter, up $154 million from the previous quarter. Of the total residential real estate builder and developer NPAs, $42 million were C&I NPAs, $343 million were commercial construction NPAs, and $316 million were commercial mortgage NPAs. These also represented 12 percent, 52 percent, and 39 percent of the quarterly increases in C&I, commercial construction, and commercial mortgage NPAs, respectively. NPAs in the C&I portfolio of $557 million increased $143 million, or 35 percent, from the previous quarter. Commercial construction NPAs were $659 million, an increase of $107 million, or 19 percent, from the second quarter of 2008. Commercial mortgage NPAs were $749 million, a sequential increase of $209 million, or 39 percent. Commercial real estate loans in Michigan and Florida represented 42 percent of our total commercial real estate portfolio while increases in NPAs in these states represented 66 percent of commercial real estate NPA growth and accounted for 68 percent of total commercial real estate NPAs.
Consumer NPAs of $841 million, or 2.54 percent, increased $164 million, or 24 percent, in the third quarter of 2008. Of the growth, $154 million was experienced in residential real estate portfolios. Included within consumer NPAs, primarily in residential real estate loans, were $427 million in debt restructurings, including a net $104 million that were restructured in the third quarter of 2008. These debt restructurings assist qualifying borrowers in creating workable payment plans to enable them to remain in their homes. Residential mortgage
 
NPAs increased $143 million to $593 million and home equity NPAs increased $11 million to $194 million. OREO represented $118 million of total residential mortgage NPAs and $25 million in total home equity NPAs. Residential real estate loans in Michigan and Florida represented 52 percent of the growth in residential real estate NPAs, 58 percent of total residential real estate NPAs, and 35 percent of total residential real estate loans.
Loans still accruing over 90 days past due were $671 million, up $63 million or 10 percent, from the second quarter of 2008. Consumer 90 days past due balances decreased 9 percent from the previous quarter and commercial 90 days past due balances increased 37 percent.
Capital Position
 
 
The tangible equity ratio decreased 18 bps to 6.19 percent. The Tier 1 capital ratio increased 2 bps to 8.53 and the total capital ratio increased 10 bps to 12.25. The Tier 1 and total capital ratios were higher in the third quarter as the reported net loss to common shareholders of $81 million was more than offset by a decrease in risk weighted assets due to lower off balance sheet exposures and the increase in the reserve for loan and lease losses. Our tangible equity to tangible assets ratio target is 6 to 7 percent; the tier 1 capital ratio target is 8 to 9 percent; and our total capital ratio target is 11.5 to 12.5 percent.
