Earnings Highlights
 
 
NM: not meaningful
Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB) today reported a full year 2008 net loss of $2.2 billion, or $3.94 per diluted share, compared with net income of $1.1 billion, or $1.99 per diluted share in 2007. Reported fourth quarter 2008 earnings were a net loss of $2.2 billion, or $3.82 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $81 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008 and net income of $16 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Fourth quarter results included a non-cash charge of $965 million pre-tax, or $1.64 per share after-tax, to record the impairment of goodwill. This write-down resulted from goodwill impairment testing that was performed at the end of the fourth quarter due to the decline in the stock price during the quarter, and the resulting difference between market capitalization and book value of the Bancorp. The results of the goodwill impairment testing showed that the estimated fair values of certain of the Bancorp's reporting units were less than their book values, resulting in this charge.
Fourth quarter results also included the effect of actions taken to address areas of the loan portfolio exhibiting the most significant credit deterioration. During the fourth quarter, the Bank sold or transferred to held-for-sale loans with contractual balances of $1.6 billion and a carrying value of approximately $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. Approximately 90 percent of these loans were commercial real estate secured loans in Florida and Michigan. Loans sold had contractual balances of $240 million, carrying values (net of prior charge-offs) at the end of the third quarter of $177 million, on which we recorded fourth quarter net charge-offs of $120 million. Loans transferred to held-for-sale had contractual balances of $1.4 billion and carrying values of $1.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. Net charge-offs of $680 million were recorded in the fourth quarter on these loans as they were written down to bids received or collateral liquidation values. Overall, net charge-offs on loans either sold or transferred to held-for-sale during the fourth quarter totaled $800 million, which reflected a reduction in the value of loans sold or transferred to approximately 33 cents of their contractual balances. Fifth Third also significantly increased its reserve for loan and lease losses to $2.8 billion, resulting in an allowance to loan and lease ratio of 3.31 percent, up from 2.41 percent in the third quarter, and an allowance to nonperforming loans ratio of 123 percent, up from 79 percent in the third quarter.
Reported results for the fourth quarter also included $40 million pre-tax, or $0.05 per share after-tax, in other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charges on securities, a non-cash estimated charge of $34 million pre-tax, or $0.06 per share after-tax, to lower the current cash surrender value of one of our BOLI policies, and an estimated $8 million pre-tax, or $0.01 per share after-tax, due to changes on loss estimates related to the Bancorp's indemnification obligation with Visa.
During the quarter, Fifth Third Bancorp sold $3.4 billion in preferred shares to the U.S. Department of the Treasury under its Capital Purchase Program, which represented approximately 3.0% of September 30, 2008 risk-weighted assets. This investment was the primary cause of the increase in our tangible equity ratio to 7.86 percent, our Tier 1 capital ratio to 10.59 percent, and our total capital ratio to 14.79 percent. In order to meet the standard terms of the Capital Purchase Program, Fifth Third repurchased its Series D and Series E
 
preferred stock for aggregate consideration in cash of $28 million. The purchase was accounted for as a retirement of the $9 million par value of Series D and Series E preferred stock and the remaining $19 million was paid as an extraordinary dividend to the holders of those preferred stock issues. Overall, this action represented a charge of $0.05 per diluted share.
"Economic conditions have deteriorated across our footprint and have placed both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios under significant stress, as evident in our bottom line results for the year," said Kevin T. Kabat, Chairman, President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "The resultant decline in our stock price during the quarter, and the evaluation of goodwill, led to our recording of goodwill impairment of $940 million after-tax during the quarter. This is a non-cash charge and it doesn't negatively affect our cash flow or our capital ratios."
Our underlying business results continue to be solid. We produced growth in both consumer and commercial deposit accounts of 4%, excluding acquisitions. Our Everyday Great Rates strategy helped us expand our customer base despite the extremely aggressive deposit competition we saw in 2008. Additionally, corporate banking fees were $444 million for the full year, up 21% in 2008, and electronic payments processing revenue and service charges on deposits were both up 11%.
Since the beginning of the current credit cycle in the second half of 2007, we have been aggressively addressing our loan portfolio exposure to the geographies and industries most affected by this credit downturn. Actions we've taken include suspending originations of residential homebuilder and developer loans and commercial non-owner occupied real estate loans, discontinuing all brokered home equity products, and implementing more stringent underwriting standards. We have significantly increased our reserves by over $1.9 billion over the course of 2008, including over $700 million in the fourth quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we took actions that resulted in the recording of significant losses. We sold or transferred to held-for-sale of $1.3 billion of commercial loans, based on the combined carrying value of these loans at the end of the third quarter. These steps were intended to further reduce the risk of our most problematic loan portfolios, primarily residential homebuilder and commercial non-owner occupied real estate loans in Michigan and Florida. During the quarter, $800 million in losses were recorded on these loans sold or transferred to held-for-sale. We also continued to be very aggressive in dealing with problematic loans in our consumer portfolio, modifying a total of $218 million loans during the quarter. Modifying these loans is beneficial not only to our shareholders but is also consistent with the needs of our customers, and result in a greater likelihood of payment and more value ultimately received by Fifth Third. As of year-end, we had $574 million in restructured customer loans on our books. We understand that these actions significantly impacted our bottom line results, but we believe the actions taken in 2008 to mitigates risks and fortify the balance sheet will benefit our shareholders and customers in 2009 as this credit cycle progresses.
 
During 2008, we raised a combined $4.5 billion in preferred equity, including $3.4 billion under the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, and increased our reserve for loan and lease losses by $1.9 billion from the prior year's level, bolstering the strength of our balance sheet. The investment by the Treasury was made on December 31, 2008. This additional capital increases our capacity to provide credit to businesses and consumers in our markets in coming periods and to further assist struggling borrowers as we work together to manage through this difficult environment."
Income Statement Highlights
 
Net interest income of $897 million on a taxable equivalent basis declined $171 million from the third quarter of 2008, largely driven by a $134 million reduction in loan discount accretion related to the second quarter 2008 acquisition of First Charter Corporation ("First Charter"). Excluding the benefit of the loan discount accretion of $81 million in the fourth quarter and $215 million in the third quarter, net interest income declined $37 million, or 4 percent, from the third quarter 2008. This sequential decline was driven by a number of factors, which included the effect of loan interest reversals and higher nonperforming loan balances, a change in the mix of deposits to higher priced CDs and savings products as a result of a highly competitive deposit pricing environment, and the effect of lower market interest rates on deposit spreads. In a low rate
 
environment, asset yields decline but it is difficult to reduce rates paid on lower yielding deposit accounts to the same extent. These negative effects were partially offset by wider loan spreads and the addition of assets related to certain off-balance sheet programs.
The reported net interest margin was 3.46 percent, down 78 bps from 4.24 percent in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a 54 bps reduction in the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for First Charter loan discount accretion, which contributed 31 bps to the fourth quarter margin versus 85 bps of benefit to the third quarter margin. Excluding this impact, the net interest margin would have been 3.15 percent, a decline of 24 bps from the previous quarter. This decline was driven by the change in mix of deposits, deposit costs declining less than asset yields, higher interest reversals, and the addition of assets due to customer use of contingent liquidity facilities related to certain off-balance sheet programs. These items were partially offset by wider loans spreads.
Compared with the fourth quarter of 2007, net interest income increased $112 million and the net interest margin increased 17 bps from 3.29 percent, both primarily due to the impact of loan discount accretion from the First Charter acquisition. Excluding this effect, net interest income increased by $31 million, or 4 percent, from the same period in 2007, and the net interest margin declined 14 bps.
Average Loans
 
Average portfolio loan and lease balances increased 2 percent sequentially and were up 10 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007. Acquisitions had no impact on sequential growth and accounted for 3 percent of average loan growth on a year-over-year basis.
Average commercial loan and lease balances grew 3 percent sequentially and 19 percent compared with the previous year. During the fourth quarter, commercial and industrial (C&I) average loans grew by approximately $1.7 billion primarily due to the use of contingent liquidity facilities related to certain off-balance sheet programs. Excluding these items and the impact of acquisitions, commercial loan balances were
 
consistent with third quarter balances and increased 12 percent from the previous year, with year-over-year growth driven by C&I lending, up 19 percent due primarily to strong production during the first and second quarters of 2008. Nearly half of the growth in commercial mortgage balances and all of the growth in commercial construction balances from the same period in 2007 was attributable to acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, $1.3 billion in commercial loans were either sold or transferred to held-for-sale, but there was minimal impact to average loan balances due to the timing of these actions.
Consumer loan and lease balances were flat sequentially and declined 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding acquisitions, consumer loan balances declined 5 percent from the previous year, which included a decline in auto loans as a result of $2.7 billion in securitizations in the first quarter of 2008. Sequentially, modest home equity loan growth, a result of lower pay-downs in the quarter, along with credit card and auto loan growth was offset by declines in residential mortgage loans. On a year-over-year basis, growth in home equity and credit card loans was more than offset by a reduction in residential mortgage and auto loan balances. Excluding acquisitions, residential mortgage loans declined 14 percent from the previous year.
Average Deposits
 
Average core deposits increased 1 percent sequentially and were up 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007. Acquisitions had no effect on sequential core deposit growth and a 4 percent positive effect compared with the same quarter last year. Sequential growth in average demand deposit (DDA) and consumer CD balances was partially offset by lower interest checking, savings and money market deposits, and foreign office commercial sweep deposits. On a year-over-year basis, growth in DDA, savings, and consumer CD balances more than offset lower interest checking, money market, and foreign office commercial sweep deposits. Average transaction deposits (excluding consumer time deposits) were down 3 percent from the third quarter and declined 2 percent from a year ago. The decline was driven by lower average balances resulting from weaker economic conditions, as well as the migration of savings balances to higher rate CDs.
Retail average core deposits increased 4 percent both sequentially and from the fourth quarter of 2007. Strong sequential growth in consumer CD balances was partially offset by lower interest checking balances, a
 
result of lower average balances during the quarter. DDA and savings balances were consistent with the previous quarter as lower average balances offset net new account growth. Commercial core deposits decreased 5 percent sequentially and were down 6 percent from the previous year as lower market rates led customers to carry lower balances and to substitute fees for compensating balances in payment for treasury management services. Sequential growth in DDA and interest checking account balances was driven by customers shifting balances into DDA products given the increased FDIC insurance limits, and was more than offset by lower savings and money market account balances. The sequential increase in CDs $100,000 and over was driven by growth in customer jumbo CDs and other time deposits in an overall effort to reduce exposure to market-related funding sources.
Noninterest Income
 
Noninterest income of $642 million decreased $75 million sequentially and increased $133 million from a year ago. Fourth quarter results included a non-cash estimated charge of $34 million to lower the current cash surrender value of one of our BOLI policies. The remaining carrying value on this BOLI policy is $290 million. Fourth quarter results also included securities OTTI charges of $40 million. Third quarter results were impacted by a $76 million gain related to a satisfactory resolution of a court case related to goodwill stemming from a previous acquisition in 1998, a $51 million OTTI charge on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock, and a non-cash BOLI charge of $27 million. Excluding these items, noninterest income of $716 million was consistent with the third quarter, driven primarily by strong corporate banking revenue offset by declines in deposit fees and investment advisory fees. Fourth quarter 2007 results included a $177 million non-cash BOLI charge. Excluding the BOLI charge in both periods and the $40 million in OTTI charges in the fourth quarter of 2008, noninterest income increased by $30 million, or 4 percent from the previous year. Year-over-year growth in noninterest income was driven by stronger mortgage activity, growth in corporate banking, and growth in payments processing revenue.
Electronic payment processing (EPP) revenue of $230 million declined 2 percent sequentially and increased 3 percent from a year ago. Merchant processing revenue was relatively flat sequentially and compared to the previous year, as the benefit of continued account acquisition was offset by a decline in average dollar amount per credit card transaction due to lower consumer spending. Card issuer interchange revenue declined 2 percent sequentially, driven primarily by a decline in the average dollar amount per debit and credit
 
card transaction. Interchange revenue increased 7 percent from the previous year, driven by higher credit card transactions as a result of the Bancorp's credit card growth initiative, partially offset by a lower dollar amount per transaction. Financial institutions revenue decreased 3 percent compared with the previous quarter, relating to lower transaction volume in a weaker economic environment, and grew 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 on higher transaction volumes as card use continues to replace cash at the point of transaction.
Service charges on deposits of $162 million decreased 6 percent sequentially and increased 2 percent compared with the same quarter last year. Retail service charges decreased 12 percent from the third quarter and 7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 due to lower checking account transaction volume. Commercial service charges increased 3 percent sequentially and 14 percent compared with last year. This growth primarily reflected an increase in customer accounts and lower market interest rates, as reduced earnings credit rates paid on customer balances have resulted in higher realized net services fees to pay for treasury management services.
Corporate banking revenue of $121 million increased by $17 million, or 16 percent from the previous quarter. Sequential results were driven by strong growth in interest rate derivative revenue, up 50 percent; business lending fees, up 13 percent; institutional sales, up 7 percent; and foreign exchange revenue, up 4 percent. Corporate banking revenue increased by $15 million, or 14 percent on a year-over-year basis. Strong growth in foreign exchange revenue, up 64 percent, business lending fees, up 10 percent, and institutional sales revenue, up 4 percent, more than offset declines in interest rate derivative revenue, down 27 percent.
Investment advisory revenue of $78 million was down 13 percent sequentially and 17 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007. Institutional trust revenue decreased 22 percent from the same period the previous year largely driven by lower asset values. Mutual fund fees were down 21 percent year-over-year, as a shift to lower yielding investments and lower asset values drove declines. Brokerage fees were down 14 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting the continued shift in assets from equity products to lower yielding money market funds due to extreme market volatility as well as a decline in transaction-based revenues.
Mortgage banking net revenue was a net loss of $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, a decline of $74 million from third quarter results and a $55 million decline from the fourth quarter of 2007. MSR valuation adjustments, including mark-to-market related adjustments on free-standing derivatives, represented a net loss of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with a net loss of $15 million last quarter and a net loss of $6 million a year ago. These losses were fully offset by gains in MSR balance sheet hedges reported in securities gains and losses. Fourth quarter originations were $2.1 billion, up from $2.0 billion the previous quarter, and resulted in fees and the sale of mortgages held-for-sale of $45 million compared with gains of $43 million during the previous quarter, and $18 million during the same period in 2007. Revenue for the fourth quarter included $3 million of gains on the sale of portfolio loans compared with $8 million in the previous quarter and $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The adoption of FAS 159 for mortgage banking in the first
 
quarter of 2008 contributed $12 million of the year-over-year increase in mortgage banking revenue, with corresponding origination costs recorded in noninterest expense. Net servicing revenue, before mortgage servicing rights (MSR) valuation adjustments, totaled $22 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $17 million last quarter and $14 million a year ago. The mortgage-servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $496 million at quarter end on a servicing portfolio of $40.4 billion.
Net securities gains on non-qualifying hedges on MSRs were $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, $22 million in the third quarter and $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Net losses on investment securities were $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with a net loss of $63 million last quarter. The fourth quarter losses were driven by an OTTI charge of $37 million on trust preferred securities. These securities are now carried at $172 million on a combined basis, versus an original par value of $209 million. Results also included an OTTI charge of $3 million on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock, which are now carried at $1 million in aggregate versus original par values of $69 million.
Other noninterest income totaled $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with $112 million last quarter and negative $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter results included an estimated non-cash charge of $34 million that lowered the current cash surrender value of one of our BOLI policies, while third quarter 2008 results included the $76 million gain related to a satisfactory resolution of a court related to supervisory goodwill in a case stemming from a prior acquisition in 1998, partially offset by a $27 million non-cash BOLI charge. Fourth quarter 2007 results also included a $177 million BOLI charge. Excluding these items, other noninterest income decreased by $5 million from the previous quarter and $6 million from the previous year. Both the sequential and year-over-year declines were primarily driven by higher write-downs on other real estate owned (OREO) properties.
Noninterest Expense
 
Noninterest expense of $2.0 billion increased $1.1 billion both sequentially and from a year ago. The significant increase in expenses was primarily driven by the $965 million pre-tax charge to record goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding this charge, noninterest expense of $1.1 billion increased $90 million sequentially and $117 million from a year ago. Fourth quarter results included higher expenses related to the difficult operating environment that included higher provision for unfunded commitments, higher
 
reinsurance reserve accruals to cover losses on proprietary private residential mortgage insurance, and increased reserves for derivative counterparty losses. The combination of these expenses accounted for $91 million of expense increase sequentially and $96 million compared to the previous year. Additionally, fourth quarter 2008 results included an estimated net $8 million charge due to changes on loss estimates related to our indemnification obligation with Visa, while third quarter results included a $45 million charge related to Visa litigation, $36 million related to legal expenses associated with the satisfactory resolution of a goodwill suit related to a 1998 acquisition, and $7 million in seasonally higher pension expense. Fourth quarter 2007 results included a $94 million charge due to Visa litigation and $8 million in acquisition related expenses. On a year-over-year comparison basis, acquisitions added approximately $26 million of additional operating expense, and the impact of the adoption of FAS 159 on the classification of mortgage origination costs has added approximately $12 million. Remaining expense growth on both a sequential and year-over-year basis was attributable to higher volume-related payment processing expense, increased equipment and occupancy expense, and higher loan and lease processing costs as a result of increased collection activities.
Credit Quality
 
Net charge-offs totaled $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Results included net losses of $800 million on commercial loans that were either sold or transferred to held-for-sale during the quarter and an additional $827 million of losses, or 381 bps, on average portfolio loans and leases. Loss experience overall continues to be primarily associated with commercial residential builder and developer loans and consumer residential real estate loans, and to be disproportionately concentrated in Michigan and Florida. In aggregate, Florida and Michigan represented approximately 66 percent of total losses during the quarter and less than 30 percent of total loans and leases. Losses on commercial and consumer real estate loans in these states represented approximately 56 percent of total fourth quarter net charge-offs. Losses on loans to homebuilders and developers represented $568 million, or 35 percent of total losses, of which $128 million were incurred on
 
loans remaining in the loan portfolio (primarily states outside of Florida and Michigan) and $440 million were on loans sold or transferred to held-for-sale.
Commercial net charge-offs were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter and represented 88 percent of total losses. During the quarter, the Bank either sold or transferred to held-for-sale commercial loans that had contractual balances of $1.6 billion. At the end of the third quarter, the loans sold or transferred to held-for-sale had balances of $1.3 billion, and net losses on these loans totaled $800 million for the quarter. Of that, $120 million was realized on loans sold and $680 million was recognized on loans transferred to held-for-sale, with $39 million on C&I loans, $389 million on commercial construction loans, and $372 million on commercial mortgage loans. Approximately 49 percent of those losses were on real estate secured loans in Florida, while another 44 percent were on real estate secured loans in Michigan. Loans to residential builder and developers accounted for $440 million, or 55 percent of these total losses, of which $17 million were C&I losses, $233 million were commercial construction losses, and $190 million were commercial mortgage losses. Loans sold during the quarter had customer balances of $240 million and carrying values of $177 million at the end of the third quarter. Loans transferred to held-for-sale during the quarter had customer balances of $1.4 billion and carrying values of $1.2 billion as of the end of the third quarter.
Excluding losses from loans sold or transferred to held-for-sale, commercial net charge-offs on portfolio loans were $626 million or 470 bps. Portfolio C&I losses were $383 million, an increase of $298 million from the previous quarter. Auto dealers accounted for $84 million, or 22 percent, of C&I net charge-offs and included a $26 million customer fraud loss in Illinois. Additionally, $105 million of C&I losses were attributable to loans to companies in real estate related industries. Commercial mortgage net losses totaled $93 million, a decrease of $1 million from the previous quarter. Michigan and Florida accounted for 47 percent of commercial mortgage losses. Commercial construction net losses were $150 million, and increased $62 million from the previous quarter. Michigan and Florida accounted for 47 percent of commercial construction losses. Net losses on residential builder and developer portfolio loans totaled $128 million and decreased by 24 percent from the third quarter, and were composed of $15 million on C&I loans, $32 million on commercial mortgage loans, and $81 million on commercial construction loans. Originations of homebuilder/developer loans were suspended in 2008 and remaining portfolio balances total $2.5 billion. Commercial portfolio net charge-offs for the quarter were $498 million, or 393 bps, excluding losses on the suspended homebuilder/developer portfolio.
 
Consumer net charge-offs of $201 million, or 240 bps, were up $5 million from the third quarter of 2008. Net charge-offs in Michigan and Florida represented 49 percent of consumer losses in the fourth quarter, down from 52 percent in the third quarter of 2008. Home equity net charge-offs of $54 million declined $1 million sequentially and continued to be driven by losses on brokered home equity loans, reflecting borrower stress and lower home price valuations. Net losses on brokered home equity loans were $26 million or 49 percent of fourth quarter home equity losses, while brokered home equity loans represented $2.3 billion, or 18 percent, of the total home equity portfolio. Originations of brokered home equity loans were discontinued in 2007. Michigan and Florida represented 45 percent of fourth quarter home equity losses and 29 percent of total home equity loans. Net charge-offs within the residential mortgage portfolio were $68 million, a decrease of $9 million from the previous quarter, with losses in Michigan and Florida representing 80 percent of losses in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs in the auto portfolio increased by $11 million from the third quarter to $43 million and losses on consumer credit card loans were $30 million, up $6 million from the third quarter, as higher unemployment and weakening economic conditions continue to impact these portfolios. Auto losses were also affected by declining values of repossessed autos at auction.
 
 
Provision for loan and lease losses totaled $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, exceeding net charge-offs by $729 million. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses is reflective of a number of factors including: increased estimated loss factors due to negative trends in nonperforming assets and overall delinquencies; increased loss estimates due to the real estate price deterioration in some of the Bancorp's key lending markets; and significant declines in general economic conditions.
The allowance for loan and lease losses represented 3.31 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of quarter end, compared with 2.41 percent last quarter, and represented 123 percent of nonperforming loans, up from 79 percent the previous quarter.
 
 
 
Nonperforming assets (NPAs) at quarter end were $3.0 billion, of which $473 million were classified as held-for-sale and have been charged down or marked to their fair market value. Excluding the held-for-sale portion, NPAs were $2.5 billion, or 2.96 percent of total loans and leases and OREO, down from $2.8 billion, or 3.30 percent, last quarter. This reduction in NPAs was driven by the sale or transfer to held-for-sale of a portion of the Bank's Florida and Michigan real estate secured loan portfolios, partially offset by the effect of continued restructurings of mortgage and home equity loans in the consumer portfolio. Portfolio NPAs at quarter end consisted of $1.7 billion of non-accrual loans, down $483 million from last quarter; $574 million of restructured consumer loans, up $147 million from the previous quarter; and $230 million of other real estate owned (OREO) and repossessed personal property, up $8 million from the third quarter of 2008.
Excluding NPAs in held-for-sale, commercial NPAs of $1.5 billion, or 2.91 percent, declined $515 million, or 26 percent, from the third quarter of 2008. Residential real estate builder and developer NPAs were $366 million in the fourth quarter, down $377 million, or 51 percent, from the previous quarter. Of the residential real estate builder and developer NPAs, $21 million were C&I NPAs, $210 million were commercial construction NPAs, and $135 million were commercial mortgage NPAs. C&I portfolio NPAs of $548 million decreased $9 million, or 2 percent, from the previous quarter. Commercial construction NPAs were $400 million, a decrease of $259 million, or 39 percent, from the third quarter of 2008. Commercial mortgage NPAs were $502 million, a sequential decline of $247 million, or 33 percent. Commercial real estate loans in Michigan and Florida represented 38 percent of our total commercial real estate portfolio in the fourth quarter 2008, compared with 42 percent the previous quarter, and 37 percent of commercial real estate NPAs, compared to 68 percent the previous quarter.
Consumer NPAs of $1.0 billion, or 3.04 percent, increased $186 million, or 22 percent, from the third quarter of 2008, of which $175 million were in residential real estate portfolios. Included in consumer NPAs were $574 million in debt restructurings, of which $218 million represented loans restructured in the fourth quarter
 
of 2008. These debt restructurings assist qualifying borrowers by creating workable payment plans to enable them to remain in their homes. Residential mortgage NPAs increased $126 million to $719 million and home equity NPAs increased $49 million to $243 million. Fourth quarter other real estate owned (OREO) of $206 million included $118 million of total residential mortgage NPAs and $21 million in total home equity NPAs, compared with OREO of $198 million in the third quarter of 2008. Residential real estate loans in Michigan and Florida represented 52 percent of the growth in residential real estate NPAs, 57 percent of total residential real estate NPAs, and 35 percent of total residential real estate loans.
Loans still accruing over 90 days past due were $662 million, down $9 million from the third quarter of 2008. Commercial 90 days past due balances declined 18 percent from the previous quarter, driven by a 30 percent reduction in C&I 90 days past due balances. Consumer 90 days past due balances increased 17 percent from the previous quarter, driven by 14 percent growth in residential real estate, 30 percent growth in auto and 29 percent growth in credit card 90 days past due balances.
Capital Position
 
 
Regulatory capital ratios and the tangible equity ratio increased significantly during the quarter. The tangible equity ratio increased 167 bps to 7.86 percent, the Tier 1 capital ratio increased 202 bps to 10.59 percent, and the total capital ratio increased 249 bps to 14.79. These ratios were higher in the fourth quarter as the issuance of $3.4 billion of preferred shares to the U.S. Treasury more than offset the effect of losses recognized during the quarter. The goodwill impairment charge of $965 million did not significantly affect our capital ratios as goodwill is excluded from these ratios by definition. The Tier 1 and total capital ratios were also helped by a reduction in risk-weighted assets due to lower off-balance sheet exposures and the increase in the reserve for loan and lease losses.
Fifth Third's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio target is 6 to 7 percent; the Tier 1 capital ratio target is 8 to 9 percent; and the total capital ratio target is 11.5 to 12.5 percent.
Other
During the fourth quarter of 2008, Fifth Third acquired approximately $250 million of deposits from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), acting as receiver for Freedom Bank in Bradenton, Florida. The FDIC
 
retained substantially all of Freedom Bank's loan portfolio. This transaction raised Fifth Third's market share in the Bradenton-Sarasota-Venice Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) to 4
th
, according to FDIC data at the time of the acquisition.
During the fourth quarter, Fifth Third reduced its common dividend due to the outlook for a continued negative credit environment. The reduction is expected to conserve approximately $300 million of common equity on a full year basis, relative to the previous dividend level.
