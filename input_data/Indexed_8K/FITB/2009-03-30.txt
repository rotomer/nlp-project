On March 30, 2009, Fifth Third Bancorp ("Fifth Third") and Advent International ("Advent") announced that they entered into a master investment agreement (the "Investment Agreement") pursuant to which Advent will purchase a majority interest in Fifth Third's processing business. The joint venture involves Fifth Third Processing Solutions' merchant acquiring and financial institutions processing businesses. Fifth Third will retain its credit card issuing business.
Fifth Third's Ohio bank will contribute assets to a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary ("Opco") of a new limited liability company ("FTPS LLC") in which a newly formed company owned by Advent ("Buyer") will purchase a 51% interest for $561 million. Fifth Third will retain the remaining 49% interest in FTPS LLC and will also receive warrants to purchase additional interests in FTPS LLC of up to approximately 10% of the equity of the new company on a fully-diluted basis that are exercisable in certain circumstances. The transaction is also subject to certain price adjustments.
Opco will assume a Loan Agreement, which is secured by the assets of Opco, and is payable to indirect subsidiaries of Fifth Third in an aggregate amount of $1.25 billion. Fifth Third's Michigan bank will also provide Opco with a $125 million revolving credit facility.
Under the agreed upon terms of the operating agreement of FTPS LLC (the "Operating Agreement"), Advent will be able to name 5 directors and Fifth Third will be able to name 4 directors. Each party will have limited pre-emptive rights and will be restricted from selling their interests in certain circumstances. Also, under the Operating Agreement, Advent will have the right to require Fifth Third to purchase its interests in Buyer upon the occurrence of certain events.
Fifth Third and Opco will also enter into certain agreements to support the transition of the processing business to Opco and other related matters. Opco will provide processing services to Fifth Third.
The transaction is currently expected to close in the second quarter of 2009 and is subject to regulatory approval.

Indemnification by the Companies
Section 7.5 . (a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying party (an "") may have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party (a ""), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than thirty days following such Indemnified Party's receipt of a Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third-Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third-Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto (a ""); , , that the failure to give a timely Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

Notice Period
(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate Legal Proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense at its expense. Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall defend such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnified Party may participate in any such defense at its expense; , , that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or (ii) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim after the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue a Third-Party Claim it has assumed, as provided in the first sentence of Section 7.5(c). The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the imposition of a consent Order, injunction or decree that would materially restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) a finding or admission that would have a Material Adverse Effect on other claims made or threatened against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) any monetary liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party, and, in connection with any of the foregoing, the Indemnified Party alone shall be entitled to contest, defend, compromise and settle such Third-Party Claim in the first instance.
provided
however
(c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, (ii) is not entitled to defend the Third-Party Claim as a result of the Indemnified Party's election to defend the Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 7.5(b) or (iii) after assuming the defense of a Third-Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim within ten days after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the obligation to assume its own defense; that the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification for a Third-Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

being
understood
 
(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by providing access to each other's relevant business records and other documents, and employees; that the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall be Losses.
it
being
understood
(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.
Section 7.6 . If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim for indemnification hereunder for a Loss that does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a ""), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Direct Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Direct Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto. The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30 days within which to respond to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party rejects all or any part of the Direct Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be free to seek enforcement of its rights to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such Direct Claim.
Direct Claims
Direct Claim
Section 7.7 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Person shall be liable under this Article VII for (i) any Losses that are not direct, actual damages or (ii) any punitive, special or speculative damages, in each case, unless such Losses are paid pursuant to a third party claim.
Consequential Damages
Section 7.8 . (a) . In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person in each case relating to the Third-Party Claim or the Direct Claim, net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums (including any increase in premiums exclusively and demonstrably attributable to insurance claims relating to such Loss) incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted, except to the extent that the adjustment itself would excuse, exclude or limit the coverage of all or part of such Loss. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Losses to the same extent that such Indemnified Party would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder.
Adjustments to Losses
Insurance
(b) . In calculating the amount of any Loss, there shall be deducted an amount equal to any net Tax benefit actually realized through a reduction in cash Taxes otherwise due (including the utilization of a Tax loss or Tax credit carried forward) as a
Taxes
 
result of such Loss by the party claiming such Loss, and there shall be added an amount equal to any Tax imposed on the receipt of any indemnity payment with respect thereto.
(c) . If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from the third party in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount of Loss.
Reimbursement
(d) . For purposes of determining the failure of any representations and warranties (other than representations and warranties in Sections 3.12 and 3.14) to be true and correct, the breach of any covenants or agreements and calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be disregarded.
Qualifiers
Section 7.9 . The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to this Article VII (the ""), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, within a reasonable period of time following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill, together with reasonably detailed back-up documentation, for a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes the Loss, in which event it shall so notify the Indemnified Party. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party an amount in cash equal to the Indemnity Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than five Business Days following any final determination of the Indemnity Amount and the Indemnifying Party's liability therefor. A "final determination" shall exist when (i) the parties to the dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable Order or judgment or (iii) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-appealable determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to submit thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if an indemnity payment is to be made to Buyer hereunder for a Loss incurred by the Companies, then the amount to be paid to Buyer for such Loss will be reduced to take into account Seller's ownership of Holdco.
Payments
Indemnity Amount
Section 7.10 . All payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant to Section 7.2 or 7.3 shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Consideration, or, if applicable, as a member contribution of such amount by Seller to the Companies, for Tax purposes.
Characterization of Indemnification Payments
Section 7.11 . Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss. In the event an Indemnified Party fails to so mitigate an indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for any portion of such Loss that reasonably could have been avoided had the Indemnified Person made such efforts.
Mitigation
Section 7.12 . Following the Closing, except (a) with respect to a claim to enforce this Article VII, (b) with respect to a good faith claim for fraud or (c) as may be
Remedies
 
otherwise contemplated by Sections 2.4, 2.5, 2.11, 5.4(f) or 9.1 or by the Confidentiality Agreement, the rights and remedies of Seller and Buyer under this Article VII are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies which Seller and Buyer may have under this Agreement or otherwise against each other with respect to the Transactions; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 7.12 is intended to limit any rights the parties have under the Ancillary Agreements. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement, shall foreclose the right to indemnification or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.
Section 8.1 . This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:
Termination
(a) by written agreement of Buyer and Seller;
(b) by either Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before August 31, 2009 (the "") so long as the terminating party is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
Termination Date
(c) by Buyer or Seller if any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction or other state or federal Government Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any other action permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions and such Order or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;
(d) by Seller, by giving written notice of such termination to Buyer, if there has been a breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Buyer contained in this Agreement which (i) would result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) and (ii) cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date; or
(e) by Buyer, by giving written notice of such termination to Seller, if there has been a breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement which (i) would result in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) and (ii) cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date.
Section 8.2 . In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect, and no Party shall have any liability to any other Party or their respective Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers or employees, except for the obligations of the parties hereto contained in this Section 8.2 and in Sections 9.2, 9.5, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, 9.11 and
Effect of Termination
 
9.13 (and any related definitional provisions set forth in Article I), as applicable, and except that nothing in this Section 8.2 shall relieve any Party from liability for any breach of this Agreement that arose prior to such termination, for which liability the provisions of Article VII shall remain in effect in accordance with the provisions and limitations of such Article.
Section 9.1 . The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the covenants or agreements (including Buyer's obligation to effect the Closing) contained in this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and to enforce specifically any terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in equity.
Specific Performance

Notwithstanding the use of the word "Administrative Agent" as a defined term, the Lenders expressly agree that the Administrative Agent is not acting as a fiduciary of any Lender in respect of the Loan Documents, the Borrower or otherwise, and nothing herein or in any of the other Loan Documents shall result in any duties or obligations on the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders except as expressly set forth herein.
Section 9.1. Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or Event of Default exists unless notified in writing to the contrary by a Lender or the Borrower. In all cases in which the Loan Documents do not require the Administrative Agent to take specific action, the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in using its discretion in failing to take or in taking any action thereunder. Any instructions of the Required Lenders, or of any other group of Lenders called for under the specific provisions of the Loan Documents, shall be binding upon all the Lenders and the holders of the Obligations.
Section 9.3. Action by Administrative Agent
. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants, and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

If any such withholding is so required, the Borrower shall make the withholding or deduction, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate Governmental Authority before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon and forthwith pay such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by each Lender and the Administrative Agent free and clear of such taxes (including such taxes on such additional amount) is equal to the amount which that Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) would have received had such withholding not been made. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender pays any amount in respect of any such taxes, penalties or interest, the Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent or such Lender for that payment on demand in the currency in which such payment was made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amounts or reimburse any Lender or the Administrative Agent with respect to any taxes (i) that, except as provided in Section 10.1(c), are attributable to a Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of Section 10.1(b) or (ii) that are withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to a Lender or Administrative Agent at the time such Lender or Administrative Agent becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent such Lender's assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts or reimbursement under this Section 10.1(a). If the Borrower pays any such taxes, penalties or interest, it shall deliver official tax receipts evidencing that payment or certified copies thereof (or, if such receipts are not available, other evidence of payment reasonably acceptable to the relevant Lender or Administrative Agent) to the Lender or Administrative Agent on whose account such withholding was made (with a copy to the Administrative Agent if not the recipient of the original) on or before the thirtieth day after payment.
(b) . Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (x) on or before the Closing Date or, if later, the date such financial institution becomes a Lender hereunder, (y) on or prior to the date 60 days after written notice from Borrower that such form or certificate shall expire or become obsolete other than in connection with an event described in (z), and (z) after the occurrence of any event within Lender's control requiring a change in the most recent form of certification previously delivered by it, two duly completed and signed originals of (i) either Form W-8 BEN (relating to such Lender and entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding under the Code on all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) or Form W-8 ECI (relating to all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) of the United States Internal Revenue Service (the ), or any successor forms, (ii) solely if such Lender is claiming exemption from United States withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8 BEN, or any successor form prescribed by the IRS, and a certificate representing that such Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the

meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code) or (iii) any other applicable document prescribed by the IRS certifying as to the entitlement of such Lender to such exemption from United States withholding tax or reduced rate with respect to all payments to be made to such Lender under the Loan Documents. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Lender, within 60 days of Borrower's written request, shall submit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one or the other of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) and such other certificates as may be (i) requested by the Borrower in a written notice, directly or through the Administrative Agent, to such Lender and (ii) required under then-current United States law or regulations to avoid or reduce United States withholding taxes on payments in respect of all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents or the Obligations.

Tax Refunds
(e) The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (i) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 10.1 or (ii) becomes a Defaulting Lender, with a replacement bank or other financial institution, that (A) such replacement does not conflict with any Applicable Law, (B) no Event of Default shall have

(f) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.1 shall use its reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and Applicable Laws) to change the jurisdiction of its lending office if such a change would reduce any such additional amounts (or any similar amount that may thereafter accrue) and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
Mitigation.
. No delay or failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on the part of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations in the exercise of any power or right under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof or as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. The rights and remedies hereunder of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would otherwise have.
Section 10.2. No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies
. If any payment hereunder or date for performance becomes due and payable or performable (in each case, including as a result of the expiration of any relevant notice period) on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date of such payment or the date for such performance shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day on which date such payment shall be due and payable or such other requirement shall be performed. In the case of any payment of principal falling due on a day which is not a Business Day, interest on such principal amount shall continue to accrue during such extension at the rate per annum then in effect, which accrued amount shall be due and payable on the next scheduled date for the payment of interest.
Section 10.3. Non-Business Days
. The Borrower agrees to pay within 10 days after demand therefor any documentary, stamp or similar taxes payable in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including interest and penalties, in the event any such taxes are assessed, irrespective of when such assessment is made and whether or not any credit is then in use or available hereunder.

General Provisions
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ: FITB) and Advent International announced today that they have signed a definitive agreement whereby Advent International will acquire a 51% interest in Fifth Third's processing business through the establishment of a joint venture that values the new company at approximately $2.35 billion before valuation adjustments by either party. Fifth Third will retain the remaining 49 percent interest in the new company, Fifth Third Processing Solutions, LLC.
Cincinnati, Ohio and Boston, Massachusetts, March 30, 2009
Pursuant to the agreement, Fifth Third Bank (OH), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Fifth Third Bancorp, will contribute the assets and operations of Fifth Third's merchant acquiring and financial institutions processing businesses to a new limited liability company ("LLC"). The LLC's capitalization prior to the purchase of this interest will include senior secured notes payable to subsidiaries of Fifth Third in the amount of $1.25 billion. Advent will pay Fifth Third $561 million in cash for a 51 percent ownership interest in the equity of the LLC and for certain put rights. Additionally, Fifth Third will receive warrants in the new company exercisable in certain circumstances. Fifth Third estimates the valuation adjustments related to these warrants, the put rights, and minority interest discounts may reduce its implied valuation of the business by an estimated $50 million. The agreement is subject to certain potential purchase price adjustments. The terms and conditions of the transaction are more fully described in Fifth Third's Form 8-K filed on March 30, 2009. The transaction will be accounted for under Financial Accounting Standard 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements." Fifth Third will retain its credit card issuing business, including retail credit card and commercial multi-card services.
"Advent has a long and impressive record of investing in and growing payment processing companies to achieve exceptional results, and we believe that its investment will significantly enhance the ability of our processing business to generate even stronger results in the future," said Kevin T. Kabat, Chairman, President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "Partnering with Advent will provide the processing business with access to additional capital and resources that we believe will create significant new opportunities and incremental growth in that business. At the same time, our ability to offer the best-in-class capabilities of Fifth Third Processing Solutions to our banking customers will continue to be a key entry point for us in creating new relationships and in expanding existing relationships."
"This transaction represents the culmination of work we began last summer as part of our capital plan announced in June. It is expected to generate meaningful additions to our tangible common equity and Tier 1 capital ratios, reflecting the value of the business as a whole, while at the same time enabling us to retain significant ownership in the joint venture and its ongoing creation of value. The cash proceeds represent 13 times the earnings divested. And the valuation of the business, at 3.3 times 2008 net revenue, compares favorably with large publicly-traded processing businesses. The expected equity and capital contribution reflects not only the economic value of the interest being sold, but also the economic value of our remaining interest in the business. As a result, this transaction represents a highly efficient source of capital for our shareholders relative to capital alternatives in the current environment."
"The transaction significantly enhances the level and composition of our already very strong regulatory capital position. We believe our strengthened capital position, in combination with our strong credit reserves and earnings power, provide us with the resources and the ability to withstand a more difficult economic environment should that occur."
"We are excited to enter into this partnership with Fifth Third," said David Mussafer, Managing Partner of Advent. "We have long viewed Fifth Third Processing Solutions as the premier processor for merchants and financial institutions in the U.S., and we look forward to working with Fifth Third and the management team of the processing business to continue the impressive growth of the business. We are excited about opportunities to make further investments in this business, and we expect to leverage our international infrastructure and work with Fifth Third Processing Solutions to expand outside the U.S."
"We are pleased to welcome Advent as a partner and investor in our processing business," said Charles Drucker, President of Fifth Third Processing Solutions, who will be CEO of the new joint venture company. "Over the years, we have successfully built our processing business into one of the country's leading providers of payment processing services. Advent's worldwide set of portfolio companies in financial services and payments processing provides Fifth Third Processing Solutions with new opportunities to partner internationally. The technology focus and operational expertise of Advent and its partners will provide us with significant opportunities to enhance the wide range of products and services that we offer to clients."
 
"Our customers and employees should expect a smooth transition. Our industry-leading platform will remain in place, so our clients will not experience a system conversion, and our clients will continue to be served by the same people from Fifth Third Processing Solutions in the same locations. We look forward to working with the Advent team to grow the business going forward."
Advent has been investing in the financial services sector for over 20 years, and has backed more than 25 companies worldwide in a broad range of sub-sectors, including payments, transaction processing, and financial technology. Advent has done several transactions of particular relevance to Fifth Third Processing Solutions: CSU Cardsystem is a leading card processor in Brazil, which went public in 2006; Dolex Dollar Express, a leading money transfer business which Advent sold to Global Payments in 2003; and Monext, a French merchant acquirer and bank processor which Advent acquired in 2008.
"As a processor, Fifth Third Processing Solutions has tremendous scale in both of its core businesses, merchant acquiring and debit/ATM processing," said Chris Pike, Managing Director of Advent. "Working with our operating partner, Pam Patsley, we had identified Fifth Third Processing Solutions early on as the premier company in the payment processing space. We worked closely with Fifth Third to structure a transaction and a partnership that met our mutual objectives in a difficult environment, and to position the business for accelerated growth over this next exciting period. Patsley is the former President of First Data International where she was responsible for all of the company's business outside of the U.S. from 2002 to 2007."
The transaction is expected to contribute significantly to Fifth Third's retained earnings, capital levels and capital ratios, generating an expected pre-tax book gain of an estimated $1.7 billion and increasing Fifth Third's tangible common equity and Tier 1 capital by an estimated $1.2 billion. On a pro forma basis, the estimated increase in Fifth Third's tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio at December 31, 2008 would have been more than 0.9 percent, to approximately 5.2 percent, and its Tier 1 capital ratio would have been increased by an estimated 0.9 percent to approximately 11.5 percent. Fifth Third's December 31, 2008 pro forma book value per common share would have been an estimated $15.21, compared with the $13.57 reported, and its tangible book value per common share would have been an estimated $10.74, compared with $8.74. On a pro forma basis for 2008, the transaction would have been dilutive to Fifth Third's earnings by an estimated $100 million, or approximately 17 cents per share, of which $57 million or $0.10 per share represents non-cash intangibles amortization.
The transaction is subject to regulatory review and approval by the Ohio Department of Financial Institutions as well as review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. It is currently expected to close in the second quarter of 2009. Credit Suisse acted as exclusive financial advisor, while Sullivan & Cromwell, LLP, Chapman & Cutler, LLP, Alston & Bird, LLP, and Graydon Head & Ritchey, LLP acted as legal advisors to Fifth Third in this transaction. Morgan Stanley and Weil, Gotshal & Manges, LLP acted as financial and legal advisor, respectively, to Advent.
