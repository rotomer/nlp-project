Troubled debt restructurings (TDR) overview
Successive improvement in vintage performance during 2008 and 2009, even as volume of modification increased
Fifth Third's mortgage portfolio TDRs have redefaulted at a lower rate than other bank held portfolio modifications
Fifth Third's TDRs are about a third less likely to redefault than modifications on GSE mortgages
Mortgage TDR charge-offs in 2009 were ~$50 million (15% of mortgage charge-offs); expected to be ~$100 million in 2010 due to seasoning and growth in the TDR portfolio
Other mortgage charge-offs (unrelated to TDRs) are expected to decline in 2010 due to improving delinquency trends, lower severities and portfolio maturation
Included in 2010 charge-off outlook
Total charge-offs on consumer real estate (home equity and mortgage) TDRs expected to be ~$200 million in 2010 vs. $110 million in 2009
