Fifth Third's realized credit losses have been significantly below its SCAP submitted baseline and more adverse scenarios
We expect 2010 losses to be lower than our original baseline scenario submission despite our 3Q10 actions that resulted in immediate charge-off recognition of $510mm
Stress scenarios as of November, 2010 from Moody's Economy.com; incorporate further deterioration in credit market conditions, which is not currently expected
Realized credit losses have been significantly below SCAP submissions; expect further improvement reflecting anticipated likely economic conditions and previous credit actions
1 Red SCAP line represents more adverse scenario as adjusted by supervisors for additional assumed two-year losses. Supervisory estimates of total two-year losses under more adverse scenario were not allocated by period. Estimate allocates total two-year supervisory losses using the allocation under Fifth Third's submission.

Fifth Third capital position and goals
 -  Current capital position strong relative to peers, U.S. regulatory standards, and proposed "Basel III" standards
 Currently expect no material adjustments to Tier 1 common ratio under new rules
 Tier 1 common capital could increase under Basel proposed definitions (not assumed for capital planning)
 -  Basel III standards have begun to provide clarity on "future state" capital requirements
 U.S. regulators have expressed support for those standards (final U.S. rules are dependent on rule-making)
 -  On the basis of these standards, we have established a near-term Tier 1 common equity ratio target in the 8% range (3Q10 actual: 7.34%)
 Would provide 100 basis points cushion over the 7% fully phased-in Basel III buffered minimum for Tier 1 common that is to apply globally by 2019 (minimum of 4.5% and capital conservation buffer of 2.5%)
 We would expect internal capital generation (i.e., earnings less dividends) to cause Tier 1 common equity to continue to increase in the intermediate term, due to current limitations on the industry's ability to manage capital levels (e.g., lower than normal dividend payout ratios, share repurchases, etc.)
 -  Federal Reserve has recently established a 5% Tier 1 common minimum (post-stress) under supervisory-specified stress scenario
 For our own evaluation of results under internally-specified severe stress scenarios outlined on pp. 10-11, we target the maintenance of a Tier 1 common ratio well above the supervisory reference minimum
 -  TARP repayment: TARP capital is not needed by Fifth Third; improved economic environment, establishment of new Basel III capital standards, and strong results provide foundation for discussions with Federal Reserve
 We have significant excess capital relative to prevailing U.S. capital standards, excluding TARP
 Post-TARP repayment, we would intend for all capital ratios to immediately meet or exceed both fully phased-in Basel III buffered minimum capital ratios as well as our own internal targets
 Repayment of TARP including terms subject to Federal Reserve approval
1 Basel III minimum capital ratios are to be phased-in over a number of years. "Buffered minimums" include capital conservation buffers that are also to be phased in following phase-in of minimum ratios. A 3% leverage ratio has been proposed under Basel III but not adopted. The denominator of this ratio adopted by U.S. regulators may not be the same as that used for the calculation of the current leverage ratio. See http://www.bis.org/press/p100912.pdf for more information.
2 There is no current Tier 1 common well-capitalized minimum ratio under current U.S. capital standards. Supervisory reference minimum of 5.0% Tier 1 common capital is to be utilized for evaluation of forward-looking results under supervisory stress scenario.
Tier 1 common ratio reflects current U.S. capital definitions. See http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20101117b1.pdf for more.

Well-positioned for changed financial landscape
Fifth Third's business model is driven by traditional banking activities
 Making loans, taking deposits, treasury management
 Largest bank headquartered within core Midwest footprint
No significant business at Fifth Third impaired during crisis; core business activities not generally limited by financial reform
 Didn't/don't originate/sell CDOs or securitize loans on behalf of others; no mortgage securitizations outstanding (except <$150 million HELOC from 2003)
 Didn't/don't originate/sell subprime mortgages or Option ARMs
 De minimis market making in derivatives
 De minimis proprietary trading
 Small private equity portfolio <$100 million (holding company subsidiary)
 Low level of financial system "interconnectedness" (e.g., Fifth Third loss in Lehman bankruptcy should be less than $2 million)
 Daily VaR less than $500 thousand
While financial reform will be costly, expect financial reform to create new opportunities for banking industry through re-intermediation
Fifth Third's businesses have performed well through the crisis, and we expect to continue capitalizing on our strong competitive position as the landscape evolves further toward our traditional strengths
