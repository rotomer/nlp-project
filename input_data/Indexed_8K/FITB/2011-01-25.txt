This report contains statements about Fifth Third Bancorp ("Fifth Third") that we believe are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder, that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business. They usually can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as "will likely result," "may," "are expected to," "is anticipated," "estimate," "forecast," "projected," "intends to," or may include other similar words or phrases such as "believes," "plans," "trend," "objective," "continue," "remain," or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could," "might," "can," or similar verbs. You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the risk factors set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements we may make. Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to us.
There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (1) general economic conditions and weakening in the economy, specifically the real estate market, either nationally or in the states in which Fifth Third, one or more acquired entities and/or the combined company do business, are less favorable than expected; (2) deteriorating credit quality; (3) political developments, wars or other hostilities may disrupt or increase volatility in securities markets or other economic conditions; (4) changes in the interest rate environment reduce interest margins; (5) prepayment speeds, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions; (6) Fifth Third's ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity; (7) maintaining capital requirements may limit Fifth Third's operations and potential growth; (8) changes and trends in capital markets; (9) problems encountered by larger or similar financial institutions may adversely affect the banking industry and/or Fifth Third (10) competitive pressures among depository institutions increase significantly; (11) effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; (12) changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other regulatory agencies; (13) legislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, adversely affect Fifth Third, one or more acquired entities and/or the combined company or the businesses in which Fifth Third, one or more acquired entities and/or the combined company are engaged, including the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (14) ability to maintain favorable ratings from rating agencies; (15) fluctuation of Fifth Third's stock price; (16) ability to attract and retain key personnel; (17) ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries; (18) potentially dilutive effect of future acquisitions on current shareholders' ownership of Fifth Third; (19) effects of accounting or financial results of one or more acquired entities; (20) difficulties in separating Fifth Third Processing Solutions from Fifth Third; (21) loss of income from any sale or potential sale of businesses that could have an adverse effect on Fifth Third's earnings and future growth; (22) ability to secure confidential information through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; and (23) the impact of reputational risk created by these developments on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity.
You should refer to our periodic and current reports filed with the SEC for further information on other factors which could cause actual results to be significantly different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

. On January 20, 2011, Fifth Third Bancorp announced that it priced a $1.7 billion public offering of its common stock at a price of $14.00 per share (the "Common Stock Offering"). In connection with the Common Stock Offering, on January 20, 2011, Fifth Third entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Common Stock Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representative of the several underwriters listed therein (the "Common Stock Underwriters"), with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in its capacity as agent for an affiliate (the "Forward Seller"), and with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the "Forward Purchaser"). The Common Stock Underwriting Agreement provides for the sale by Fifth Third to the Common Stock Underwriters of 121,428,572 shares of Fifth Third Common Stock. The Underwriting Agreement further provides the Common Stock Underwriters with an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to an additional 12,142,857 shares of Fifth Third Common Stock to cover over-allotments. If such option is exercised, Fifth Third may elect in its sole discretion that all or any portion of such additional shares be sold to the Common Stock Underwriters by the Forward Seller, in which case Fifth Third would enter into a forward sale agreement with the Forward Purchaser in respect of such additional shares.
Common Stock Offering
On January 24, 2011, the Common Stock Underwriters notified Fifth Third that they have exercised their option in full to purchase the additional 12,142,857 shares of Fifth Third Common Stock at the public offering price of $14.00 per share. In connection with such exercise, Fifth Third elected that all such additional shares be sold by the Forward Seller and Fifth Third entered into a forward sale agreement dated January 24, 2011 with the Forward Purchaser (the "Forward Sale Agreement").

Also at the closing, in satisfaction of the additional shares subject to the over-allotment option, the Forward Seller borrowed and sold 12,147,857 shares of Fifth Third Common Stock to the Common Stock Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement and the Forward Sale Agreement. Fifth Third does not expect to receive any cash proceeds from the sale of the additional shares in satisfaction of the over-allotment option. Fifth Third expects that the number of any additional new shares of its common stock necessary to be issued by Fifth Third in settlement of the Forward Sale Agreement will not be significant.
The Common Stock Offering is described in Fifth Third's prospectus supplement dated January 20, 2011, together with the related prospectus dated March 25, 2010, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Rule 424(b) on January 21, 2011.

In connection with the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes, Fifth Third entered into a Supplemental Indenture dated as of January 25, 2011 with Wilmington Trust Company, as Trustee, which modifies the existing Indenture for Senior Debt Securities dated as of April 30, 2008 between Fifth Third and the Trustee. The Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture define the rights of the Senior Notes, which Senior Notes are represented by Global Securities dated as of January 25, 2011.

Purchase of the Shares by the Underwriters
(a) The Company agrees to issue and sell the Underwritten Shares to the several Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and each Underwriter, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth herein, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the respective number of Underwritten Shares set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule 1 hereto at a price per share (the "Purchase Price") of $13.58.
(b) The Underwriters shall have the right to purchase, pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) below, as applicable, solely for the purpose of covering overallotments made in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Shares, severally and not jointly, up to the maximum number of Option Shares set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in Schedule 1 hereto, at the Purchase Price less an amount per share equal to any dividends or distributions declared by the Company and payable on the Underwritten Shares during the period from, and including, the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) to, but excluding, the relevant Additional Closing Date (as
hereinafter defined) (such reduced price, the "Option Purchase Price"). The Underwriters may exercise the option to purchase Option Shares at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, on or before the thirtieth day following the date of the Prospectus, by written notice from the Representative to the Company. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Option Shares as to which the option is being exercised and the date and time when the Option Shares are to be delivered and paid for, which may be the same date and time as the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) but shall not be earlier than the Closing Date or later than the tenth full business day (as hereinafter defined) after the date of such notice (unless such time and date are postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 hereof). If any such notice is provided subsequent to the Closing Date, such notice shall be given at least two business days prior to the date and time of delivery specified therein. Following delivery of an exercise notice:
(i) Company may, in its sole discretion, within one business day after such notice is given, execute and deliver to the Forward Seller a letter agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B between the Company and the Forward Purchaser (a "Forward Sale Agreement") providing for the forward sale by the Company, subject to the Company's right to elect Cash Settlement or Net Share Settlement (as such terms are defined in the Forward Sale Agreement), of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate number of Option Shares being purchased pursuant to the exercise of such option (less any such Option Shares sold by Company directly to Forward Seller). Upon the Company's execution and delivery to the Forward Purchaser of the Forward Sale Agreement, the Forward Purchaser shall promptly execute and deliver the Forward Sale Agreement to the Company, and upon such execution and delivery to the Company, on the basis of the representations and warranties contained herein, and subject to the conditions stated herein and therein, each of the Forward Seller and the Company (with respect to any Company Top-Up Option Shares), severally and not jointly, hereby agrees to sell to the several Underwriters such Option Shares at the Option Purchase Price.
(ii) If the Company does not timely execute and deliver the Forward Sale Agreement pursuant to clause (i) above, then on the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, the Company hereby agrees to sell to the several Underwriters the aggregate number of Option Shares with respect to which the option is being exercised at the Option Purchase Price.
On the relevant Additional Closing Date, each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, to purchase from the Company or the Forward Seller, as applicable, at the Option Purchase Price, the number of Option Shares which bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of Option Shares being purchased as the number of Underwritten Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto (or such number increased as set forth in Section 10 hereof) bears to the aggregate number of Underwritten Shares being purchased from the Company by the several Underwriters, subject, however, to such adjustments to eliminate any fractional Shares as the Representative in its sole discretion shall make.
(c) If the Company has entered into a Forward Sale Agreement with the Forward Purchaser pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) hereof, and (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 3.A hereof or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto is not
true and correct in all material respects as of the relevant Additional Closing Date, (ii) the Company has not performed all of the additional obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement on or prior to the relevant Additional Closing Date, (iii) any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof has not been satisfied on or prior to the relevant Additional Closing Date, or (iv) any of the conditions to effectiveness set forth in Section 3 of the Forward Sale Agreement are not satisfied on or prior to the relevant Additional Closing Date (clauses (i) to (iv), together, the "Option Conditions"), then the Forward Seller, in its sole discretion, may elect not to borrow and deliver for sale to the Underwriters on the relevant Additional Closing Date the Borrowed Option Shares. In addition, in the event that (A) in the Forward Seller's sole reasonable judgment, it is unable to borrow and deliver for sale under this Agreement all of the Borrowed Option Shares, or (B) in the Forward Seller's sole reasonable judgment, it would incur a stock loan cost of in excess of a rate equal to 100 basis points per annum (the "Maximum Rate") to borrow and deliver for sale under this Agreement all of the Borrowed Option Shares (unless the Company has agreed in writing on or prior to the relevant Additional Closing Date to reimburse Forward Seller for its costs in borrowing and delivering for sale such Borrowed Option Shares in excess of a rate equal to the Maximum Rate), then, in each case, the Forward Seller shall only be required to deliver for sale to the Underwriters on the relevant Additional Closing Date the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that the Forward Seller is able to so borrow at or below such cost.
(d) If the Forward Purchaser has entered into a Forward Sale Agreement with the Company pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) hereof and the Forward Seller elects, pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof, not to borrow and deliver for sale to the Underwriters on the relevant Additional Closing Date the total number of Borrowed Option Shares for such Additional Closing Date, the Forward Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Company no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the first business day prior to the Closing Date or such Additional Closing Date, as the case may be.
(e) The Company understands that the Underwriters intend to make a public offering of the Shares as soon after the effectiveness of this Agreement as in the judgment of the Representative is advisable, and initially to offer the Shares on the terms set forth in the Prospectus. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters may offer and sell Shares to or through any affiliate of an Underwriter.
(f) Payment for the Shares shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Company (in the case of any Company Shares) or by the Forward Seller (in the case of any Borrowed Option Shares) to the Representative, at the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017 at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on January 25, 2011, or at such other time or place on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as the Representative and the Company may agree upon in writing or, in the case of the Option Shares, on the date and at the time and place specified by the Representative in the written notice of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Option Shares. The time and date of such payment for the Underwritten Shares is referred to herein as the "Closing Date", and the time and date for such payment for the Option Shares, if other than the Closing Date, is herein referred to as the "Additional Closing Date".
Payment for the Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall be made against delivery to the Representative for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or the
Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of such Shares duly paid by the Company (in the case of any Company Shares) or by the Forward Seller (in the case of any Borrowed Option Shares). The Company will deliver the Underwritten Shares to or as instructed by the Representative for the accounts of the several Underwriters in a form reasonably acceptable to the Representative through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") unless the Representative shall otherwise instruct on the Closing Date. The Forward Seller (with respect to any Borrowed Option Shares) and the Company (with respect to any Company Option Shares and Company Top-Up Option Shares) will deliver the Option Shares to or as instructed by the Representative for the accounts of the several Underwriters in a form reasonably acceptable to the Representative through the facilities of DTC unless the Representative shall otherwise instruct on the relevant Additional Closing Date. The certificates for the Shares will be made available for inspection and packaging by the Representative at the office of DTC or its designated custodian not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the business day prior to the Closing Date or the relevant Additional Closing Date, as the case may be.
(g) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters, the Forward Purchaser and the Forward Seller are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Shares contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, none of the Underwriters, the Forward Purchaser nor the Forward Seller is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters, the Forward Purchaser and the Forward Seller shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters, the Forward Purchaser or the Forward Seller of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters, the Forward Purchaser or the Forward Seller, as the case may be, and shall not be on behalf of the Company.

damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement, the Forward Purchaser, the Forward Seller, and each person, if any, who controls the Company, the Forward Purchaser or the Forward Seller within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Pricing Disclosure Package, it being understood and agreed upon that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described in a letter delivered by the Representative to the Company on the Closing Date.
Indemnification of the Company, the Forward Purchaser and the Forward Seller.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, the Forward

Purchaser, the Forward Seller, each of their respective affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter, the Forward Purchaser or Forward Seller shall be designated in writing by the Representative, the Forward Purchaser or the Forward Seller, as applicable, and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Person on the one hand, and the Indemnified Person on the other, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Indemnifying Person, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Person, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, the Underwriters and the Forward Seller shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company (which proceeds shall include the proceeds to be received by the Company pursuant to any Forward Sale Agreement, assuming, in each case, Physical Settlement on the Effective Date, as such terms are defined therein), the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith (in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus), and, in the case of the Forward Seller, the Spread (as defined in the relevant Forward Sale Agreement) deducted from the Forward Price (as defined in such Forward Sale Agreement), net of the cost of borrowing shares of Common Stock to hedge the exposure to such Forward Sale Agreement, as reasonably determined by the Forward Seller, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Indemnified Person, on the one hand, and the Indemnifying Person, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact

or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnified Person or by the Indemnifying Person and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company, the Underwriters, the Forward Purchaser and the Forward Seller agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and in no event shall the Forward Seller be required to contribute any amount in excess of the Spread deducted from the Forward Price under any Forward Sale Agreement net of the cost of borrowing shares of Common Stock to hedge the exposure to such Forward Sale Agreement, as reasonably determined by the Forward Seller. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
9. . This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representative, the Forward Purchaser and the Forward Seller, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or, in the case of the Option Shares, prior to the Additional Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representative, the Forward Purchaser and the Forward Seller, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Shares on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
Termination
10. .
Defaulting Underwriter
(a) If, on the Closing Date or any Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Shares by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Shares on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date or the relevant Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Shares that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the relevant Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such date plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase on such date) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the relevant Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate amount of Shares to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement or, with respect to any Additional Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Shares on such Additional Closing Date shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 12 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11. .
Issuance and Sale by the Company
(a) . In the case of any Forward Sale Agreement to be entered into pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) hereof, in the event that (i) all of the Option Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the relevant Additional Closing Date and the Forward Seller elects, pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof not to deliver and sell to the Underwriters the Borrowed Option Shares, (ii) in the Forward Seller's sole reasonable judgment, it is unable to borrow and deliver for sale under this Agreement all of the Borrowed Option Shares, or (iii) in the Forward Seller's sole reasonable judgment, it would incur a stock loan cost in excess of the Maximum Rate to borrow and deliver for sale under this Agreement all of the Borrowed Option Shares (unless the Company has agreed in writing on or prior to the relevant Additional Closing Date to reimburse Forward Seller for its costs in borrowing and delivering for sale such Borrowed Option Shares in excess of a rate equal to the Maximum Rate), then, in each case, the Company shall issue and sell to the Underwriters, pursuant to Section 2 hereof, in whole but not in part, an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Borrowed Option Shares that the Forward Seller does not so deliver and sell to the Underwriters. In connection with any such issuance and sale by the Company, the Company or the Representative shall have the right to postpone the Additional Closing Date for a period not exceeding one business day in order to effect any required changes in any documents or arrangements. The shares of Common Stock sold by the Company to the Underwriters pursuant to this Section 11(a) in lieu of Borrowed Option Shares are referred to herein as the "Company Top-Up Option Shares."
Company Top-Up Option Shares
(b) . Neither the Forward Purchaser nor the Forward Seller shall have any liability whatsoever for any Borrowed Option Shares that the Forward Seller does not deliver and sell to the Underwriters or any other party if (i) any of the Option Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the relevant Additional Closing Date and the Forward Seller elects, pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof not to deliver and sell to the Underwriters the Borrowed Option Shares, (ii) in the Forward Seller's sole reasonable judgment, it is unable to borrow and deliver for sale under this Agreement all of the Borrowed Option Shares, or (iii) in the Forward Seller's sole reasonable judgment, it would incur a stock loan cost in excess of the Maximum Rate to borrow and deliver for sale under this Agreement all of the Borrowed Option Shares (and the Company has not agreed in writing on or prior to the relevant Additional Closing Date to reimburse Forward Seller for its costs in borrowing and delivering for sale such Borrowed Option Shares in excess of a rate equal to the Maximum Rate).
Exclusion of Liability
12. .

(a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Shares and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (iv) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification of the Shares under the state or foreign securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative, the Forward Purchaser and the Forward Seller may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Shares for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Shares for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
13. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.

Indemnification of the Underwriters.
 
are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information.
Indemnification of the Company.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall

have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary, (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representative and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
Contribution.
 
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.

(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.

delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representative, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
9. . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in the Underwriting Agreement that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
 
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 10 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
10. . (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (iv) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (v) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (vii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of any offering by, FINRA; and (viii) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors.
Payment of Expenses
(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
 
11. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
12. . The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.

Dear Sirs,
The purpose of this letter agreement (this "Confirmation") is to confirm the terms and conditions of the transaction entered into between us on the Trade Date specified below (the "Transaction"). This Confirmation constitutes a "Confirmation" as referred to in the ISDA Master Agreement specified below.
 
This Confirmation evidences a complete and binding agreement between Party A and Party B as to the terms of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates.

In the event of any inconsistency between provisions of that Agreement and this Confirmation, this Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates. The parties hereby agree that no Transaction other than the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates shall be governed by the Agreement. For purposes of the 2002 Definitions, the Transaction is a Share Forward Transaction.
 
Party A and Party B each represents to the other that it has entered into the Transaction in reliance upon such tax, accounting, regulatory, legal, and financial advice as it deems necessary and not upon any view expressed by the other.

on or prior to the Effective Date to reimburse Party A for its costs in borrowing and delivering for sale such number of Shares in excess of a rate equal to 100 basis points per annum).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer of Fifth Third Bancorp, an Ohio corporation (the "Corporation"), and in that capacity I have acted as counsel to the Corporation in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and prospectus filed in connection with the registration of up to 133,571,142 shares of its common stock, without par value (the "Common Stock") and in connection with the registration of the Corporation's 3.625% Senior Notes due 2016 in the aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000,000 (the "Senior Debt Securities") being issued by the Corporation pursuant to the Indenture dated as of April 30, 2008 between the Corporation and Wilmington Trust Company, as trustee, as such Indenture has been supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated January 25, 2011 (the "Senior Debt Indenture").
As counsel for the Corporation, I have examined such corporate records, certificates, documents and matters of law as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In all such examinations, I have assumed the genuineness of signatures on original documents and the conformity to such original documents of all copies submitted to me as certified, conformed or photographic copies, and, as to statements of the officers of the Corporation and certificates of public officials, I have assumed the same to have been properly given and accurate.
Based upon such examination and the assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
(1) The Common Stock is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
(2) The Senior Debt Securities are valid and legally binding obligations of the Corporation, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
In rendering the opinion in paragraph (1) above, I have assumed that the certificates for the

Common Stock conform to the specimen thereof examined by me, and have been duly countersigned by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar of the Common Stock. In rendering the opinion in paragraph (2) above, I have assumed that the Senior Debt Securities have been duly executed and authenticated in accordance with the Senior Debt Indenture.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of Ohio, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. I express no opinion as to whether, or the extent to which, the laws of any particular jurisdiction apply to the subject matter of the agreements and documents referred to herein, including without limitation the enforceability of the governing law provisions contained in such agreements and documents.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the references to me under the heading "Validity of Securities" in the Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act.
