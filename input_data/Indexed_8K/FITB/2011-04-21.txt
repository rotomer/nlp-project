FIFTH THIRD BANCORP ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2011 NET INCOME OF $265 MILLION
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
* Pre-provision net revenue (PPNR): net interest income plus noninterest income minus noninterest expense
Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB) today reported first quarter 2011 net income of $265 million, compared with net income of $333 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and a net loss of $10 million in the first quarter of 2010. After preferred dividends, first quarter 2011 net income available to common shareholders was $88 million or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with fourth quarter net income of $270 million or $0.33 per diluted share, and a net loss of $72 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010. In connection with the repayment of the $3.408 billion TARP investment during the quarter, accretion of the remaining issuance discount was accelerated and reduced net income available to common shareholders by $153 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. This discount accretion was recorded in the preferred dividend line.
First quarter 2010 results included $121 million after-tax in benefits related to the decision to surrender one of our bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies.
Earnings Highlights
 
 
NM: Not Meaningful
"The first quarter was a significant one for Fifth Third," said Kevin T. Kabat, president and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "We redeemed the preferred stock investment purchased by the U.S. Treasury under the TARP program, as well as the associated warrant. Fifth Third never issued debt guaranteed by the TLGP program and we have thus completely exited all crisis-era government programs. In March, our Board of Directors approved a $0.05 increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.06 per share. We expect that dividend to grow as earnings increase. Our capital position is robust, and all capital ratios exceed proposed Basel III capital standards as if those standards were phased-in today.
 
First quarter results reflect broader trends within the economy, which remain sluggish although continuing to slowly recover. Average portfolio loans increased 2 percent sequentially but were flat on a period end basis, as demand remains below par for this stage of the recovery and low rates have increased borrower refinancings in the capital markets. Deposit growth continued to be strong, including transaction deposit growth of 3 percent sequentially. Net interest income results were not as strong as expected. In addition to a lower day count and the effect of debt issued as part of the repayment of TARP, loan growth was lower than anticipated and yields on new loan originations declined as credit spreads narrowed given robust capital markets conditions. We currently expect stronger net interest income results in the second quarter and second half of the year. As expected, fee income also declined due to lower mortgage-related revenue as long-term rates have reduced refinancing activity. Offsetting those trends were lower operating expenses, due to lower mortgage origination expense, and lower credit-related costs. Credit trends overall remain favorable and we expect further improvement in coming quarters in this area as well."
Income Statement Highlights
 
NM: Not Meaningful
 
Net Interest Income
 
Net interest income of $884 million on a taxable equivalent basis decreased $35 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in net interest income reflected two fewer days during the quarter (approximately $12 million); the full-quarter effect of the refinancing of the FTPS, LLC loan (approximately $8 million); lower mortgage warehouse balances in loans held-for-sale (approximately $8 million); and the effect of the $1 billion fixed-rate debt issuance done in connection with our TARP repayment (approximately $7 million). Otherwise, net interest income was flat, with the benefit of higher average loan balances, lower interest reversals on nonperforming loans, and lower deposit costs offset by lower yields on new commercial and consumer loan originations and lower loan purchase accounting accretion. The net interest margin was 3.71 percent, a decrease of 4 bps from 3.75 percent in the previous quarter. The full quarter effect of the refinancing of the FTPS, LLC loan reduced the margin by approximately 3 bps and the debt issuance reduced the margin by 3 bps, partially offset by the lower day count which improved the margin by approximately 3 bps. Otherwise, the margin was relatively stable.
Compared with the first quarter of 2010, net interest income decreased $17 million and the net interest margin increased 8 bps. The decrease in net interest income was largely the result of lower average loan balances from a year ago, while the net interest margin improvement largely reflected deposit growth and shift in mix from higher cost term deposits to lower cost deposit products.
Securities
Average securities and other short-term investments were $17.3 billion in the first quarter of 2011, compared with $18.1 billion in the previous quarter and $20.6 billion in the first quarter of 2010. The primary driver of the sequential decline was a $500 million decrease in average short-term investments due to lower cash balances at the Fed. The year-over-year decline was due to our decision not to fully reinvest cash flows from the portfolio in 2010.
 
Loans
 
Average loan and lease balances (excluding loans held-for-sale) increased 2 percent sequentially and declined 1 percent from the first quarter of 2010. Period end loan and lease balances were flat sequentially, as first quarter originations were generally offset by payoffs and pay-downs experienced during the quarter.
Average commercial portfolio loan and lease balances increased 1 percent sequentially and declined 4 percent from the first quarter of 2010. Commercial and industrial (C&I) average loans increased 4 percent sequentially, due to the effect of strong levels of originations late in the fourth quarter of 2010 and modestly higher utilization rates in the first quarter. The full quarter effect of the fourth quarter refinancing of the $1.25 billion FTPS, LLC loan reduced first quarter average C&I loans by $277 million. Compared with the first quarter of 2010, C&I average loans increased 4 percent. Average commercial mortgage and commercial construction loan balances declined by a combined 3 percent sequentially and 17 percent from the same period the previous year, reflecting continued low customer demand and tighter underwriting standards. The year-over-year comparison was also affected by the transfer of $961 million of loans to loans held-for-sale at the end of the third quarter 2010. Commercial line usage, on an end of period basis for the first quarter, increased slightly to 33.3 percent of committed lines versus 32.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 32.6 percent in the first quarter 2010. Commercial portfolio period end loan balances were down $260 million, or 1 percent, driven by lower commercial mortgage and commercial construction loans as those portfolios continue to experience run-off, partially offset by higher C&I balances.
Average consumer portfolio loan and lease balances were up 2 percent sequentially and increased 3 percent from the first quarter 2010. Average residential mortgage loans increased 11 percent sequentially and 16 percent compared with the first quarter 2010. Residential mortgage average loan balances benefitted by $310 million sequentially from the continued retention of certain shorter-term fixed-rate residential mortgages, largely branch originated. Average auto loans increased 2 percent sequentially and 9 percent year-over-year as continued strong loan origination volumes more than offset higher pay downs. This growth was partially offset by lower home equity loan balances, which declined 2 percent sequentially and 8 percent year-over-year due to lower demand and production.
 
Average loans held-for-sale of $1.7 billion declined $1.2 billion from fourth quarter levels due primarily to lower mortgage loans in the held-for-sale warehouse. Loans held-for-sale were relatively flat compared with the first quarter of 2010.
Deposits
 
 
Average core deposits increased 1 percent sequentially and 2 percent from the first quarter of 2010, with strong transaction deposit growth partially offset by continued runoff of consumer time deposits (CDs). Average transaction deposits, excluding consumer time deposits, increased 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 and 9 percent year-over-year. Sequential growth was primarily driven by higher interest checking, savings, and demand deposit account (DDA) balances. Year-over-year performance was largely due to growth in savings and DDA balances.
Retail average transaction deposits increased 3 percent sequentially and 14 percent from the first quarter of 2010 and reflected growth across all transaction deposit account categories for each comparison period. Higher average DDA and interest checking account balances contributed to the improvement. Consumer CDs included in core deposits declined 13 percent sequentially and 39 percent year-over-year, driven by ongoing downward pricing adjustments, which continued to reflect our high levels of liquidity as well as customer reluctance to extend CD maturities given the current low rate environment.
Commercial average transaction deposits increased 3 percent sequentially and 2 percent from the previous year. Excluding public funds balances, commercial average transaction deposits increased 1 percent sequentially and 17 percent from the first quarter of 2010 driven by DDA and interest checking balances. Average public funds balances were $5.7 billion, up $574 million sequentially largely due to seasonally strong deposit balances, and down $2.5 billion from the first quarter of 2010 due to ongoing pricing adjustments which continue to reflect our excess liquidity position.
 
Noninterest Income
 
Noninterest income of $584 million decreased $72 million, or 11 percent, sequentially and decreased $43 million, or 7 percent compared with results a year ago. The sequential decline was driven by lower mortgage-related revenue, investment securities gains, and seasonally lower corporate banking revenue and deposit service charges, partially offset by lower credit-related costs recognized in other noninterest income. The year-over-year decline reflected lower mortgage-related revenue and deposit service charges due to the effect of the August implementation of Regulation E.
First quarter 2011 results included a $2 million negative valuation adjustment on warrants and puts related to the processing business sale, compared with $3 million in positive valuation adjustments on these instruments in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $2 million in negative valuation adjustments in the first quarter of 2010. First quarter 2011 results included a $9 million reduction in income due to the increase in fair value of the liability related to the total return swap entered into as part of the 2009 sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. This item reduced noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2010 by $5 million and $9 million, respectively. Excluding these items, as well as investment securities gains in all periods, noninterest income decreased $40 million, or 6 percent, from the previous quarter driven by lower mortgage-related revenue, seasonal declines in corporate banking revenue and service charges on deposits, partially offset by lower credit-related costs recognized in other noninterest income. On a year-over-year basis, noninterest income excluding the items mentioned above decreased $37 million, or 6 percent, due to lower mortgage-related revenue and deposit service fees.
Service charges on deposits of $124 million decreased 11 percent sequentially and 12 percent compared with the same quarter last year. Retail service charges declined 16 percent from the previous quarter due primarily to seasonality and declined 26 percent compared with the first quarter of 2010, largely due to the implementation of new overdraft regulations and overdraft policies. Commercial service charges decreased 7 percent sequentially due to seasonality and were consistent with last year.
Corporate banking revenue of $86 million decreased 17 percent from seasonally strong fourth quarter results and increased 6 percent from the same period last year. Sequential results were driven by lower syndication fee revenue and business lending fees as well as lower letter of credit and foreign exchange revenue. On a year-over-year basis, higher revenue from syndication fees and interest rate derivative sales and foreign exchange more than offset lower institutional sales revenue and letters of credit fees.
 
Investment advisory revenue of $98 million increased 5 percent sequentially and 8 percent from the first quarter of 2010. The sequential growth was driven by higher tax-related private bank revenue, institutional trust revenue, and brokerage fees due to continued market value increases, as well as improved sales production resulting in strong net asset and account growth. On a year-over-year basis, improvement reflected an overall increase in equity and bond market values.
Card and processing revenue was $80 million in the first quarter of 2011, down 1 percent sequentially and up 10 percent from the first quarter of 2010. The sequential decrease reflected lower transaction volumes versus the seasonally strong fourth quarter while the year-over-year comparison reflected higher transaction volumes as general improvement in the economy drove increased spending.
Mortgage banking net revenue was $102 million in the first quarter of 2011, a decrease of $47 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 and a decrease of $50 million from the first quarter of 2010. First quarter 2011 originations were $3.9 billion, a decrease from $7.4 billion in the previous quarter and increase from $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2010. First quarter 2011 originations resulted in gains of $62 million on mortgages sold compared with gains of $158 million during the previous quarter and $71 million during the first quarter of 2010. Gain on sale margins declined sequentially due to rising mortgage rates in the quarter. Mortgage servicing fees this quarter were $58 million, compared with $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $53 million in the first quarter of 2010. Mortgage banking revenue is also affected by net servicing asset value adjustments, which include mortgage servicing rights (MSR) amortization and MSR valuation adjustments (including mark-to-market adjustments on free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio). These net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $18 million in the first quarter of 2011 (reflecting MSR amortization of $28 million and MSR valuation adjustments of positive $10 million); negative $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 (MSR amortization of $47 million and MSR valuation adjustments of negative $20 million); and positive $28 million in the first quarter of 2010 (MSR amortization of $23 million and positive $51 million in MSR valuation adjustments). The mortgage-servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $894 million at quarter end on a servicing portfolio of $55 billion.
Gains on securities held as non-qualifying hedges for the MSR were $5 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and none in the first quarter of 2010.
Other noninterest income totaled $81 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $55 million in the previous quarter and $74 million in the first quarter of 2010, largely driven by improvements in net credit-related costs. Other noninterest income for all periods included revenue associated with the transition service agreement (TSA) entered into as part of our processing business sale, revenue from our equity interest in the processing business, any effects of the valuation of warrants and puts related to the processing business sale, and any changes in income related to the valuation of the total return swap entered into as part of the
 
2009 sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. As of March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, and March 31, 2010, TSA revenue was $11 million, $11 million, and $13 million, respectively; revenue from our processing business equity interest was $9 million, $8 million, and $5 million, respectively; valuation adjustments were negative $2 million, positive $3 million, and negative $2 million, respectively; and reductions in income related to the Visa, Inc. total return swap were $9 million, $5 million, and $9 million, respectively. Excluding these items, other noninterest income increased $44 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to the effects of lower net credit-related costs, and increased $5 million from the first quarter of 2010.
Net credit-related costs recognized in noninterest income were $3 million in the first quarter of 2011 versus $34 million last quarter and $1 million in the first quarter of 2010. First quarter 2011 results included $17 million of net gains on sales of commercial loans held-for-sale and $16 million of fair value charges on commercial loans held-for-sale, as well as $2 million of losses on other real estate owned (OREO). Fourth quarter 2010 results included $21 million of net gains on sales of commercial loans held-for-sale and $35 million of fair value charges on commercial loans held-for-sale, as well as $19 million of losses on OREO. First quarter 2010 results included net gains of $25 million on the sale of loans held-for-sale, $9 million of fair value charges on commercial loans held-for-sale, and $16 million of losses on OREO.
Net gains on investment securities were $8 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with investment securities gains of $21 million in the previous quarter and $14 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Noninterest Expense
 
Noninterest expense of $918 million in the first quarter 2011 decreased from $987 million in the fourth quarter 2010 and $956 million a year ago. Excluding $17 million of expenses related to the termination of $1 billion in FHLB funding in the fourth quarter 2010, noninterest expense declined $52 million sequentially. This remaining sequential decline was driven primarily by lower revenue-based compensation as well as lower credit-related expenses, partially offset by a $23 million seasonal increase in FICA and unemployment costs. Excluding a $4 million charge to increase the litigation reserve associated with bank card memberships in the first quarter 2010, noninterest expense declined $34 million from a year ago, due to significantly lower credit-related expenses. Each period included operating expenses related to the processing business that were largely offset by revenue under the TSA reported in other noninterest income.
 
Noninterest expenses incurred related to problem assets totaled $31 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $91 million in the first quarter of 2010. First quarter credit-related expenses included provision expense for mortgage repurchases of $8 million, compared with $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $39 million a year ago. (Realized mortgage repurchase losses were $24 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with $23 million last quarter and $13 million in the first quarter of 2010.) Provision for unfunded commitments was a benefit of $16 million in the current quarter, compared with a benefit of $4 million last quarter and $9 million of expense to increase this reserve a year ago. Derivative valuation adjustments related to customer credit risk were a net zero this quarter versus positive $1 million last quarter and $8 million in expense a year ago. OREO expense was $13 million this quarter, compared with $11 million last quarter and $6 million a year ago. Other work out-related expenses were $26 million in the first quarter, compared with $27 million the previous quarter and $29 million in the same period last year.
Credit Quality
 
Net charge-offs were $367 million in the first quarter of 2011, or 192 bps of average loans on an annualized basis. Fourth quarter 2010 net charge-offs were $356 million, or 186 bps of average loans on an annualized basis. The increase in net charge-offs from the prior quarter was primarily the result of a commercial loan that was foreclosed upon in the fourth quarter 2010 which was collateralized by individual consumer loans. These loans were subsequently moved to other consumer loans in the fourth quarter 2010. We recorded $22 million of charge-offs related to these loans in the first quarter of 2011, recorded in "other consumer loans and leases." First quarter 2010 net charge-offs were $582 million, or 301 bps of average loans on an annualized basis. The decrease in net charge-offs from the prior year reflected continued improvement in the credit quality of loans in our portfolio as well as the impact of the credit actions taken during the third quarter of 2010.
 
Commercial net charge-offs were $164 million, or 152 bps, compared with $173 million, or 159 bps, in the fourth quarter of 2010. Commercial net charge-offs decreased $9 million sequentially with improvement in commercial mortgage and C&I partially offset by higher commercial construction losses. C&I net losses were $83 million, compared with net losses of $85 million in the previous quarter. Commercial mortgage net losses totaled $54 million compared with net losses of $80 million in the fourth quarter. Commercial construction net losses were $26 million, compared with net losses of $11 million in the prior quarter. Net losses on residential builder and developer portfolio loans across the C&I and commercial real estate categories totaled $22 million. Originations of homebuilder/developer loans were suspended in 2007 and the remaining portfolio balance is $651 million, down from a peak of $3.3 billion in the second quarter of 2008.
Consumer net charge-offs were $203 million, or 243 bps, in the first quarter of 2011, compared with $183 million, or 220 bps, in the fourth quarter. Consumer net charge-offs increased $20 million as a result of higher losses in other consumer loans, as discussed earlier. Net charge-offs on residential mortgage loans in the portfolio were $65 million, compared with portfolio losses of $62 million in the previous quarter. Home equity net charge-offs were $63 million, compared with portfolio losses of $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net losses on brokered home equity loans represented 38 percent of first quarter home equity losses and 15 percent of the total home equity portfolio. The home equity portfolio included $1.6 billion of brokered loans, down from a peak of $2.6 billion in 2007; originations of these loans were discontinued in 2007. Net charge-offs in the auto portfolio of $20 million was consistent with the prior quarter, and net losses on consumer credit card loans were $31 million, down $2 million from the previous quarter. Net charge-offs in other consumer loans were $24 million, up $20 million from the previous quarter due to the previously mentioned commercial loan that was foreclosed upon in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
 
 
Provision for loan and lease losses totaled $168 million in the first quarter of 2011, up $2 million from the fourth quarter and down $422 million from the first quarter of 2010. The allowance for loan and lease losses represented 3.62 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of quarter end, compared with 3.88 percent last quarter, and represented 170 percent of nonperforming loans and leases, 132 percent of nonperforming assets, and 188 percent of first quarter annualized net charge-offs.
 
 
Total nonperforming assets, including loans held-for-sale, were $2.3 billion, a decline of $126 million, or 5 percent, from the previous quarter. Nonperforming assets held-for-investment (NPAs) at quarter end were $2.1 billion or 2.73 percent of total loans, leases and OREO, and decreased $48 million, or 2 percent, from the previous quarter. Nonperforming loans held-for-investment (NPLs) at quarter end were $1.6 billion or 2.11 percent of total loans and leases, and decreased $35 million, or 2 percent, from the fourth quarter. The decrease in total nonperforming assets was driven by the sale of assets from held-for-sale during the quarter and by decreases in NPLs and OREO in the held-for-investment portfolio.
Commercial portfolio NPAs at quarter-end were $1.6 billion, or 3.64 percent of commercial loans, leases and OREO, and increased $10 million, or 1 percent, from the fourth quarter. Commercial portfolio NPLs were $1.2 billion, or 2.78 percent of commercial loans and leases, and decreased $3 million from last quarter. Commercial construction portfolio NPAs were $248 million, a decline of $11 million from the previous quarter.
 
Commercial mortgage portfolio NPAs were $696 million, up $18 million from the prior quarter. Commercial real estate loans in Michigan and Florida represented 48 percent of commercial real estate NPAs and 37 percent of our total commercial real estate portfolio. C&I portfolio NPAs of $620 million increased $8 million from the previous quarter. Within the overall commercial loan portfolio, residential real estate builder and developer portfolio NPAs declined $10 million from the fourth quarter to $249 million, of which $75 million were commercial construction assets, $160 million were commercial mortgage assets and $14 million were C&I assets. Commercial portfolio NPAs included $149 million of nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), compared with $141 million last quarter.
Consumer portfolio NPAs of $538 million, or 1.57 percent of consumer loans, leases and OREO, decreased $58 million from the fourth quarter. Consumer portfolio NPLs were $434 million, or 1.26 percent of consumer loans and leases, and decreased $32 million from last quarter. Of consumer NPAs, $409 million were in residential real estate portfolios. Residential mortgage NPAs were $338 million, down $29 million from the previous quarter, with Florida representing 47 percent of residential mortgage NPAs and 19 percent of total residential mortgage loans. Home equity NPAs were consistent with last quarter at $71 million. Credit card NPAs declined $2 million from the previous quarter to $54 million. Other consumer NPAs declined $24 million to $60 million, due to charge-offs on loans that collateralized the previously mentioned commercial loan foreclosed upon in the fourth quarter 2010. Consumer nonaccrual TDRs were $209 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with $206 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Fourth quarter OREO balances included in portfolio NPA balances described above were $461 million compared with $467 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, and included $323 million in commercial real estate assets, $77 million in residential mortgage assets, $46 million in C&I assets, and $15 million in home equity assets. Repossessed personal property of $20 million consisted largely of autos.
Loans still accruing over 90 days past due were $266 million, down $8 million or 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010. Commercial balances 90 days past due of $39 million increased $9 million sequentially. Consumer balances 90 days past due of $227 million declined $17 million from the previous quarter. Loans 30-89 days past due of $538 million decreased $98 million, or 15 percent, from the previous quarter. Commercial balances 30-89 days past due of $187 million declined $20 million, or 10 percent, sequentially and consumer balances 30-89 days past due of $351 million declined $78 million, or 18 percent, from the seasonally high fourth quarter.
At quarter-end, we held $216 million of commercial nonaccrual loans for sale, compared with $294 million at the end of the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we transferred approximately $43 million of commercial loans from the portfolio to loans held-for-sale, and we transferred approximately $10 million of loans from loans held-for-sale to OREO. We recorded negative valuation adjustments of $16 million on held-for-sale loans and we recorded net gains of $17 million on loans that were sold or settled during the quarter.
 
Capital Position
 
 
Capital ratios remained strong during the quarter. Compared with the prior quarter, the Tier 1 common equity ratio increased 150 bps to 9.00 percent, the Tier 1 capital ratio decreased 173 bps to 12.21 percent and the Total capital ratio decreased 185 bps to 16.29 percent. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased 135 bps to 8.39 percent excluding unrealized gains/losses, and increased 131 bps to 8.61 percent including unrealized gains/losses. The Tier 1 common and tangible common equity ratios increased due to the issuance of $1.7 billion in common equity during the first quarter in connection with the redemption of the TARP preferred stock of $3.4 billion, as well higher retained earnings. The Tier 1 capital, total capital, and other ratios that include preferred stock declined due to the net $1.7 billion reduction in preferred and common stock, partially offset by higher retained earnings.
Book value per share at March 31, 2011 was $12.80 and tangible book value per share was $10.11, compared with December 31, 2010 book value per share of $13.06 and tangible book value per share of $9.94. Book value and tangible book value per share were increased by higher retained earnings and the issuance of common stock at a premium, offset by the effect of the repurchase of the TARP warrant from the U.S. Treasury.
Average diluted common shares of 895 million shares increased 59 million shares from 836 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2010. During the first quarter, we issued 122 million common shares in connection with the redemption of TARP preferred stock. However, the acceleration of the discount accretion associated with
 
the TARP preferred stock reduced earnings below the level at which our Series G convertible preferred shares are included in the fully diluted common share count (in other words, absent this item, the 36 million shares underlying the Series G convertible preferred shares would have been included in the fully diluted share count). Fourth quarter 2010 earnings per share were computed using the "if converted" method, which resulted in an increase in our diluted share count for the quarter. In most previous quarters, these shares were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation, as their impact would have been anti-dilutive to EPS. Period end common shares outstanding were 918.7 million in the first quarter of 2011, up 122.4 million compared with 796.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, due to the issuance of 122.4 million shares during the quarter. The inclusion or exclusion of the fully dilutive effect of the common shares underlying the Series G shares has no impact on end of period shares.
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) recently proposed new capital rules for Internationally Active banks, known as "Basel III." Fifth Third is subject to U.S. bank regulations for capital, which have not yet been issued in response to the Basel proposals. Fifth Third's capital levels exceed current U.S. "well-capitalized" standards and proposed Basel III standards, and we expect Fifth Third's capital levels to continue to exceed U.S. "well-capitalized" standards including the adoption of U.S. rules that incorporate changes contemplated under Basel III.
Fifth Third's Tier 1 and Total capital levels at March 31, 2011 included $2.8 billion of Trust Preferred securities, or 2.8 percent of risk weighted assets. Under the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation recently passed, these Trust Preferred securities are intended to be phased out of Tier 1 capital over three years beginning in 2013. The BIS also issued proposals that would include a phase-out of these securities, although over a longer period. To the extent these securities remain outstanding during and after the phase-in period, they would be expected to continue to be included in Total capital, subject to prevailing U.S. capital standards. The BIS has also proposed adjustments to definitions of capital, including what is to be included in the definition of Tier 1 common, and to risk weightings applied to certain types of assets. We do not currently expect these proposed adjustments to negatively affect Fifth Third's Tier 1 common capital levels and for any positive effect to be modest.
Fifth Third was one of 19 bank holding companies that submitted a capital plan for the years 2011 and 2012, approved by its board of directors, to the Federal Reserve as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System did not object to the proposed capital actions in its capital plan, which included an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2011 and the possible future redemption of certain trust preferred securities. The board of directors approved an increase to the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.06 per share on March 22, 2011 from $0.01 per share.
We expect to manage our capital structure  including the components represented by common equity and non-common equity  over time to adapt to the effect of legislation, changes in U.S. bank capital regulations reflecting changes to BIS capital rules, and our goals for capital levels and capital composition as appropriate given any changes in rules.
