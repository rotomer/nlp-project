Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB) today reported second quarter 2011 net income of $337 million, compared with net income of $265 million in the first quarter of 2011 and net income of $192 million in the second quarter of 2010. After preferred dividends, second quarter 2011 net income available to common shareholders was $328 million or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with first quarter net income of $88 million or $0.10 per diluted share, and net income of $130 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010.
First quarter 2011 net income available to common shareholders was reduced by $153 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, of discount accretion recorded in preferred dividends accelerated by the February repurchase of $3.408 billion of TARP CPP Preferred Stock.
Earnings Highlights
 
 
"Fifth Third's second quarter results were strong and reflected continued improvement in credit trends," said Kevin T. Kabat, president and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. "Bottom-line results were the best Fifth Third has generated since 2007 and drove strong returns  a 1.2 percent return on assets, a 14 percent return on average tangible common equity, and 4 percent unannualized sequential growth in tangible book value per share.
Noninterest income increased 12 percent from the first quarter and expenses were well-controlled, down 2 percent. Mortgage banking revenue improved significantly from the first quarter, and card and processing revenue and corporate banking revenue were both up 10 percent or more. Period-end loan balances were up 1 percent driven by 3 percent growth in both C&I and residential mortgage loans; average transaction deposits increased 2 percent and core deposits increased 1 percent reflecting continued CD run-off.
 
Net interest income and the net interest margin were both down modestly in the quarter reflecting a flatter yield curve and heightened loan pricing competition. We expect both measures to improve in the third and fourth quarters.
Credit results continued to trend favorably. Net charge-offs were $304 million, down 17 percent from last quarter and were the lowest level we've experienced since the beginning of 2008. Nonperforming asset levels and delinquencies also declined. We expect further improvement in credit results in the second half of the year.
Overall, we expect second half 2011 results to produce similarly strong or stronger returns and build upon the 11 percent growth in tangible book value per share we've generated over the past year."
Income Statement Highlights
 
Net Interest Income
 
 
Net interest income of $869 million on a taxable equivalent basis decreased $15 million from the first quarter of 2011. The decline in net interest income was attributable to lower yields on commercial and consumer loans, a flatter yield curve and lower LIBOR rates, partially offset by higher loan balances, lower deposit costs and CDs maturing or migrating into lower cost deposit categories. A higher day-count increased net interest income by $6 million, offset by higher interest expense resulting from hedge ineffectiveness and the full quarter effect of the issuance of $1 billion in fixed-rate debt in the first quarter of 2011. The net interest margin was 3.62 percent, a decrease of 9 bps from 3.71 percent in the previous quarter, and was impacted by the previously mentioned items. Of the decrease, 2 bps was attributable to hedge ineffectiveness, 2 bps to the higher day-count, and 1 bp to the increase in long-term debt.
Compared with the second quarter of 2010, net interest income decreased $18 million while the net interest margin increased 5 bps. The decrease in net interest income was largely the result of lower loan yields, partially offset by higher average loan balances and run-off in higher-priced CDs. The net interest margin improvement largely reflected deposit growth and shift in mix from higher cost term deposits to lower cost deposit products.
Securities
Average securities and other short-term investments were $17.2 billion in the second quarter of 2011, consistent with $17.3 billion in the previous quarter and down from $20.9 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Lower cash balances held at the Fed contributed to the sequential and year-over-year declines.
Loans
 
Average loan and lease balances (excluding loans held-for-sale) were up $301 million sequentially and increased $964 million, or 1 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Period end loan and lease balances grew $502 million, or 1 percent from the first quarter and $1.7 billion or 2 percent from a year ago.
 
Average commercial portfolio loan and lease balances were up $160 million sequentially and declined $761 million or 2 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Commercial and industrial (C&I) average loans increased 2 percent sequentially and 7 percent compared with the second quarter of 2010. Average commercial mortgage and commercial construction loan balances declined by a combined 3 percent sequentially and 17 percent from the same period the previous year, reflecting continued low customer demand and tighter underwriting standards. The year-over-year comparison was also affected by the transfer of $961 million of loans to loans held-for-sale at the end of the third quarter 2010. Commercial line usage, on an end of period basis for the second quarter, was consistent at 32.9 percent of committed lines versus 33.3 percent in the first quarter of 2011 and 32.1 percent in the second quarter of 2010.
Average consumer portfolio loan and lease balances were up $141 million sequentially and increased $1.7 billion, or 5 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Average residential mortgage loans increased 4 percent sequentially and 24 percent compared with the second quarter of 2010. Sequential and year-over-year growth reflected the continued retention of certain shorter-term fixed-rate residential mortgages, branch originated, which totaled $283 million in the second quarter. Average auto loans increased 1 percent sequentially and 10 percent year-over-year as continued strong loan origination volumes more than offset pay-downs. This growth was partially offset by lower home equity loan balances, which declined 2 percent sequentially and 8 percent year-over-year due to lower demand and production.
Average loans held-for-sale of $1.2 billion declined $527 million from first quarter levels and $618 million compared with the second quarter of 2010 driven primarily by lower balances of mortgage loans in the held-for-sale warehouse due to deliveries in excess of origination volumes.
Deposits
 
 
Average core deposits increased 1 percent sequentially and 2 percent from the second quarter of 2010, as transaction deposit growth was partially offset by continued runoff of consumer time deposits (CDs). Average transaction deposits, excluding consumer time deposits, increased 2 percent from the first quarter of 2011 and 9 percent year-over-year. Sequential and year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher demand deposit account (DDA) and savings balances.
 
Retail average transaction deposits increased 4 percent sequentially and 13 percent from the second quarter of 2010 and reflected growth across all transaction deposit account categories for each comparison period, particularly DDA and savings. Consumer CDs included in core deposits declined 9 percent sequentially and 41 percent year-over-year, driven by maturities of higher-rate CDs and customer reluctance to purchase longer CD maturities given the current low rate environment.
Commercial average transaction deposits decreased 2 percent sequentially and increased 1 percent from the previous year. The sequential decline reflects seasonally higher balances in the first quarter. Growth in DDAs was offset by lower interest checking, money market and foreign office accounts. On a year-over-year basis, strong DDA growth more than offset lower public funds balances. Average public funds balances were $5.7 billion, flat sequentially and down $663 million from the second quarter of 2010 due to ongoing pricing adjustments which continue to reflect our excess liquidity position.
Noninterest Income
 
Noninterest income of $656 million increased $72 million or 12 percent sequentially and $36 million or 6 percent compared with results a year ago. The sequential growth was driven by higher mortgage-related revenue, corporate banking revenue and card and processing revenue. The year-over-year growth reflected higher mortgage-related revenue partially offset by lower deposit service charges due to the effect of the August 2010 implementation of Regulation E.
Second quarter 2011 results included a $29 million positive valuation adjustment on warrants and puts related to the 2009 sale of an interest in our processing business, compared with $2 million in negative valuation adjustments on these instruments in the first quarter of 2011 and a $10 million positive valuation adjustment in the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter 2011 results included a $4 million reduction in income due to the increase in fair value of the liability related to the total return swap entered into as part of the 2009 sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. This item reduced noninterest income in the first quarter of 2011 by $9 million. Excluding these items, as well as investment securities gains in all periods, noninterest income increased $38 million, or 6 percent, from the previous quarter driven by higher mortgage-related revenue, corporate banking
 
revenue and card and processing revenue. On a year-over-year basis, noninterest income excluding the items mentioned above increased $23 million, or 4 percent, due to higher mortgage-related revenue partially offset by lower deposit service charges.
Service charges on deposits of $126 million increased 1 percent sequentially from a seasonally light first quarter and decreased 16 percent compared with the same quarter last year, due to lower retail service charges. Retail service charges were flat compared with the previous quarter and declined 34 percent compared with the second quarter of 2010, largely due to the implementation of new overdraft regulations and overdraft policies. Commercial service charges increased 2 percent sequentially and 3 percent compared with the same quarter last year.
Corporate banking revenue of $95 million increased 11 percent from the first quarter of 2011 and increased 2 percent from the same period last year. Sequential results were driven by higher lease remarketing fees, syndication fee revenue and institutional sales revenue. On a year-over-year basis, higher revenue from business lending fees primarily drove the increase.
Mortgage banking net revenue was $162 million in the second quarter of 2011, a 58 percent increase from the first quarter of 2011 and a 42 percent increase from the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter 2011 originations were $3.1 billion, a decrease from $3.9 billion in the previous quarter and $3.8 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter 2011 originations resulted in gains of $64 million on mortgages sold compared with gains of $62 million during the previous quarter and $89 million during the second quarter of 2010. Gain on sale margins increased sequentially from weak first quarter levels as interest rates were generally lower this quarter. Mortgage servicing fees this quarter were $58 million, compared with $58 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $54 million in the second quarter of 2010. Mortgage banking revenue is also affected by net servicing asset value adjustments, which include mortgage servicing rights (MSR) amortization and MSR valuation adjustments (including mark-to-market adjustments on free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio). These net servicing asset valuation adjustments were positive $40 million in the second quarter of 2011 (reflecting MSR amortization of $25 million and MSR valuation adjustments of positive $65 million); negative $18 million in the first quarter of 2011 (MSR amortization of $28 million and MSR valuation adjustments of positive $10 million); and negative $29 million in the second quarter of 2010 (MSR amortization of $25 million and negative $4 million in MSR valuation adjustments). The mortgage-servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $847 million at quarter end on a servicing portfolio of $56 billion.
Investment advisory revenue of $95 million decreased 3 percent sequentially and increased 10 percent from the second quarter of 2010. The sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonally high tax-related private client services fees in the first quarter and a less active securities trading environment in the second quarter. Year-over-year improvement reflected an overall increase in equity and bond market values.
 
Card and processing revenue was $89 million in the second quarter of 2011, an increase of 10 percent sequentially and 5 percent from the second quarter of 2010. The sequential increase reflected higher transaction volumes compared with the seasonally weak first quarter, while the year-over-year comparison reflected higher transaction volumes as general improvement in the economy drove increased spending.
Other noninterest income totaled $83 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $81 million in the previous quarter and $85 million in the second quarter of 2010. Other noninterest income included revenue associated with the transition service agreement (TSA) entered into as part of our processing business sale, revenue from our equity interest in the processing business, effects of the valuation of warrants and puts related to the processing business sale, and changes in income related to the valuation of the total return swap entered into as part of the 2009 sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. For periods ending June 30, 2011, March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2010, TSA revenue was $5 million, $11 million, and $13 million, respectively; revenue from our processing business equity interest was $6 million, $9 million, and $6 million, respectively; warrant/put valuation adjustments were positive $29 million, negative $2 million, and positive $10 million, respectively; and reductions in income related to the Visa, Inc. total return swap were $4 million this quarter and $9 million in the first quarter. Excluding these items, other noninterest income decreased $25 million from the previous quarter and $9 million from the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to the effects of higher net credit-related costs recognized in other noninterest income.
Net credit-related costs recognized in other noninterest income were $28 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $3 million last quarter and $15 million in the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter 2011 results included $8 million of net gains on sales of commercial loans held-for-sale and $9 million of fair value charges on commercial loans held-for-sale, as well as $26 million of losses on other real estate owned (OREO). First quarter 2011 results included $17 million of net gains on sales of commercial loans held-for-sale and $16 million of fair value charges on commercial loans held-for-sale, as well as $2 million of losses on OREO. Second quarter 2010 results included net gains of $6 million on the sale of loans held-for-sale, $7 million of fair value charges on commercial loans held-for-sale, and $13 million of losses on OREO.
Net gains on investment securities were $6 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared with investment securities gains of $8 million in the previous quarter and $8 million in the second quarter of 2010.
There were no gains on securities held as non-qualifying hedges for the MSR, compared with $5 million in the first quarter of 2011 and none in the second quarter of 2010.
 
Noninterest Expense
 
Noninterest expense of $901 million decreased 2 percent from the first quarter of 2011 and decreased 4 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Excluding $6 million of debt extinguishment gains in the second quarter and $3 million in the first quarter recorded as a reduction to other noninterest expense, noninterest expense declined $14 million sequentially and $28 million compared with the second quarter of 2010. The remaining sequential decline was primarily driven by lower employee benefits expense due to a decrease in FICA and unemployment costs from seasonally high first quarter levels as well as improvements in other noninterest expense, partially offset by higher salaries, wages, and incentives. The remaining year-over-year decline was due to significantly lower credit-related expenses. Each period included operating expenses related to the processing business that were largely offset by revenue under the TSA reported in other noninterest income.
Credit costs related to problem assets recorded as noninterest expense totaled $36 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared with $32 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $55 million in the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter credit-related expenses included provision expense for mortgage repurchases of $14 million, compared with $8 million in the first quarter and $18 million a year ago. (Realized mortgage repurchase losses were $22 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared with $24 million last quarter and $19 million in the second quarter of 2010.) Provision for unfunded commitments was a benefit of $14 million in the current quarter, compared with a benefit of $16 million last quarter and a benefit of $6 million a year ago. Derivative valuation adjustments related to customer credit risk were $1 million in expense this quarter versus a net of zero last quarter and $9 million in expense a year ago. OREO expense was $6 million this quarter, compared with $13 million last quarter and $7 million a year ago. Other problem asset-related expenses were $30 million in the second quarter, compared with $28 million the previous quarter and $26 million in the same period last year.
 
Credit Quality
 
Net charge-offs were $304 million in the second quarter of 2011, or 156 bps of average loans on an annualized basis. First quarter 2011 net charge-offs were $367 million, or 192 bps of average loans on an annualized basis. Second quarter 2010 net charge-offs were $434 million, or 226 bps of average loans on an annualized basis.
Commercial net charge-offs were $141 million, or 130 bps, down $23 million versus $164 million, or 152 bps, in the first quarter. Improvement in charge-offs was broad-based. C&I net losses were $76 million, compared with net losses of $83 million in the previous quarter. Commercial mortgage net losses totaled $47 million compared with net losses of $54 million in the first quarter. Commercial construction net losses were $20 million, compared with net losses of $26 million in the prior quarter. Net losses on residential builder and developer portfolio loans across the C&I and commercial real estate categories totaled $14 million. Originations of homebuilder / developer loans were suspended in 2007 and the remaining portfolio balance is $597 million, down from a peak of $3.3 billion in the second quarter of 2008.
Consumer net charge-offs were $163 million, or 189 bps, down $40 million versus $203 million, or 243 bps, in the first quarter. Improvements were driven by trends in the residential mortgage and automobile portfolios, partially offset by the effect of charge-offs on loans from a credit relationship in the other consumer loans and leases portfolio described below. Net charge-offs on residential mortgage loans in the portfolio were $36 million, down from $65 million in the previous quarter, with lower losses in Florida driving $16 million of improvement. Home equity net charge-offs were $54 million, compared with portfolio losses of $63 million in the first quarter. Net losses on brokered home equity loans represented 36 percent of second quarter home equity losses; such loans are 14 percent of the total home equity portfolio. The home equity portfolio included $1.6 billion of brokered loans, down from a peak of $2.6 billion in 2007; originations of these loans were discontinued in 2007. Net charge-offs in the auto portfolio of $8 million declined $12 million from the prior
 
quarter. Net losses on consumer credit card loans were $28 million, down $3 million from the previous quarter. Net charge-offs in other consumer loans were $37 million, up $13 million from the previous quarter, primarily the result of a commercial loan that was foreclosed upon in the fourth quarter 2010 which was collateralized by individual consumer loans. These loans were subsequently moved to other consumer loans. We recorded $34 million and $23 million of charge-offs related to these loans in the second and first quarters of 2011, respectively, and have no remaining loss exposure following the second quarter 2011 charge-offs.
 
 
Provision for loan and lease losses totaled $113 million in the second quarter of 2011, down $55 million from the first quarter of 2011 and $212 million from the second quarter of 2010. The allowance for loan and lease losses represented 3.35 percent of total loans and leases outstanding as of quarter end, compared with 3.62 percent last quarter, and represented 160 percent of nonperforming loans and leases, 125 percent of nonperforming assets, and 214 percent of second quarter annualized net charge-offs.
 
 
Total nonperforming assets, including loans held-for-sale, were $2.3 billion, a decline of $78 million, or 3 percent, from the previous quarter. Nonperforming assets held-for-investment (NPAs) at quarter end were $2.1 billion or 2.66 percent of total loans, leases and OREO, and decreased $38 million, or 2 percent, from the previous quarter. Nonperforming loans held-for-investment (NPLs) at quarter end were $1.6 billion or 2.09 percent of total loans, leases and OREO, and decreased $6 million from the first quarter. The decrease in total nonperforming assets was driven by the sale of assets from held-for-sale during the quarter and by decreases in NPLs and OREO in the held-for-investment portfolio.
Commercial portfolio NPAs at quarter-end were $1.6 billion, or 3.68 percent of commercial loans, leases and OREO, and increased $24 million, or 2 percent, from the first quarter. Commercial portfolio NPLs were $1.3 billion, or 2.86 percent of commercial loans and leases, and increased $42 million from last quarter. Commercial construction portfolio NPAs were $240 million, a decline of $8 million from the previous quarter. Commercial mortgage portfolio NPAs were $710 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter. Commercial real estate loans in Michigan and Florida represented 44 percent of commercial real estate NPAs and 37 percent of our total commercial real estate portfolio. C&I portfolio NPAs of $638 million increased $18 million from the previous quarter. Within the overall commercial loan portfolio, residential real estate builder and developer portfolio NPAs declined $6 million from the first quarter to $243 million, of which $68 million were commercial construction assets, $159 million were commercial mortgage assets and $16 million were C&I
 
assets. Commercial portfolio NPAs included $188 million of nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), compared with $149 million last quarter.
Consumer portfolio NPAs of $476 million, or 1.37 percent of consumer loans, leases and OREO, decreased $63 million from the first quarter. Consumer portfolio NPLs were $387 million, or 1.12 percent of consumer loans and leases, and decreased $48 million from last quarter. Of consumer NPAs, $410 million were in residential real estate portfolios. Residential mortgage NPAs were $338 million, consistent with the previous quarter, with Florida representing 47 percent of residential mortgage NPAs and 18 percent of total residential mortgage loans. Home equity NPAs were consistent with last quarter at $71 million. Credit card NPAs declined $4 million from the previous quarter to $50 million. Other consumer NPAs declined $57 million to $3 million, primarily due to charge-offs on loans that collateralized the previously mentioned commercial loan foreclosed upon in the fourth quarter 2010. Consumer nonaccrual TDRs were $211 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared with $209 million in the first quarter.
Second quarter OREO balances included in portfolio NPA balances described above were $434 million compared with $461 million in the first quarter, and included $355 million in commercial OREO and $79 million in consumer OREO. Repossessed personal property of $15 million consisted largely of autos.
Loans still accruing over 90 days past due were $279 million, up $13 million, or 5 percent, from the first quarter of 2011. Commercial balances 90 days past due of $68 million increased $29 million sequentially. Consumer balances 90 days past due of $211 million declined $16 million from the previous quarter. Loans 30-89 days past due of $466 million decreased $83 million, or 15 percent, from the previous quarter. Commercial balances 30-89 days past due of $135 million declined $54 million, or 29 percent, sequentially and consumer balances 30-89 days past due of $331 million declined $29 million, or 8 percent, from the first quarter.
At quarter-end, we held $176 million of commercial nonaccrual loans for sale, compared with $216 million at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we transferred approximately $15 million of commercial loans from the portfolio to loans held-for-sale, and we transferred approximately $10 million of loans from loans held-for-sale to OREO. We recorded negative valuation adjustments of $9 million on held-for-sale loans and we recorded net gains of $8 million on loans that were sold or settled during the quarter.
 
Capital Position
 
 
Capital ratios remained strong during the quarter. Compared with the prior quarter, the Tier 1 common equity ratio increased 21 bps to 9.20 percent. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased 25 bps to 8.64 percent excluding unrealized gains/losses, and increased 36 bps to 8.96 percent including unrealized gains/losses. These ratios increased primarily due to higher retained earnings. The Tier 1 capital ratio decreased 27 bps to 11.93 percent, the Total capital ratio decreased 24 bps to 16.03 percent, and the Leverage ratio decreased 18 bps to 11.03 percent. These decreases were primarily due to the redemption of $452 million in Trust Preferred Securities (TruPS), partially offset by higher retained earnings.
Book value per share at June 30, 2011 was $13.23 and tangible book value per share was $10.55, compared with March 31, 2011 book value per share of $12.80 and tangible book value per share of $10.11.
Average diluted common shares of 955.5 million shares increased 60.7 million shares from 894.8 million shares in the first quarter of 2011. This increase was due primarily to first quarter capital actions and the dilution treatment of our Series G convertible preferred shares. First, the average fully diluted share count increased due to the full quarter effect of our first quarter 2011 issuance of 122 million common shares in connection with the redemption of TARP preferred stock. The average effect of the issuance of these shares increased the quarterly average share count by 32.7 million shares. Second, our repurchase of the warrants associated with the TARP preferred stock late in the first quarter eliminated their dilutive effect to the fully diluted share count, whereas they represented an average of 7.2 million shares in the first quarter fully diluted
 
share count. Finally, the higher level of earnings reported in the second quarter resulted in our Series G convertible preferred shares being included in the fully diluted common share count in the second quarter under the "if converted" method. In the first quarter, fully diluted earnings per share was calculated using the preferred dividend rather than including these shares in the common share count, as their impact would have been anti-dilutive to EPS. This increased average fully diluted common shares by 35.5 million versus the first quarter. Period end common shares outstanding were 919.8 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared with 918.7 million in the first quarter of 2011. The inclusion or exclusion of the fully dilutive effect of the common shares underlying the Series G shares has no impact on end of period shares.
The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has proposed new capital rules for Internationally Active banks, known as "Basel III." Fifth Third is subject to U.S. bank regulations for capital, which have not yet been issued in response to the Basel proposals. Fifth Third's capital levels exceed current U.S. "well-capitalized" standards and proposed Basel III standards, and we expect Fifth Third's capital levels to continue to exceed U.S. "well-capitalized" standards including the adoption of U.S. rules that incorporate changes contemplated under Basel III and/or the Dodd-Frank Act.
Fifth Third's Tier 1 and Total capital levels at June 30, 2011 included $2.3 billion of TruPS, or 2.3 percent of risk weighted assets compared with $2.8 billion at March 31, 2011. During the quarter, the Bancorp redeemed at par $452 million of its TruPS, including $400 million 8.875% retail TruPS, and $52 million in floating rate capital securities. Under the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, these TruPS are intended to be phased out of Tier 1 capital over three years beginning in 2013. The BIS also issued proposals that would include a phase-out of these securities, although over a longer period. We will continue to evaluate the role of these types of securities in our capital structure, based on regulatory developments. To the extent these types of securities remain outstanding during and after the phase-in period, they would be expected to continue to be included in Total capital, subject to prevailing U.S. capital standards. The BIS has also proposed adjustments to definitions of capital, including what is to be included in the definition of Tier 1 common, and to risk weightings applied to certain types of assets. We do not currently expect these proposed adjustments to negatively affect Fifth Third's Tier 1 common capital levels and for any positive effect to be modest.
We expect to manage our capital structure  including the components represented by common equity and non-common equity  over time to adapt to the effect of legislation, changes in U.S. bank capital regulations reflecting changes to BIS capital rules, and our goals for capital levels and capital composition as appropriate given any changes in rules.
