Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
As previously reported, on April 19, 2011, Fifth Third Bancorp held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders for which the Board of Directors solicited proxies. In its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 20, 2011, Fifth Third Bancorp reported the results of the voting at the 2011 Annual Meeting, including the approval by its shareholders in an advisory vote of its recommendation to hold an advisory vote for the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers every 1 year.
Accordingly, on February 27, 2012, Fifth Third Bancorp filed its preliminary Proxy Statement for its upcoming Annual Meeting scheduled for April 17, 2012 and has included, among other items, both an annual advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers as well as another advisory vote on the frequency of votes on the compensation of the named executive officers.
In addition to the disclosure by incorporation by reference in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 20, 2011 of its Proxy Statement dated March 10, 2011 which included statements that the Board believes that emerging corporate practices and governance trends favor an annual advisory vote and that the Board of Directors recommends holding an advisory vote for the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers every 1 year, and for the avoidance of doubt, Fifth Third is hereby amending its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 20, 2011 as stated herein and as added by item (d) below.
(d) In light of the approval at the April 19, 2011 Annual Meeting by its shareholders in an advisory vote of its recommendation to hold an advisory vote for the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers every 1 year, Fifth Third will hold future shareholder advisory votes on compensation of the named executive officers every 1 year until its next vote on the frequency of shareholder votes on the compensation of executives.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
