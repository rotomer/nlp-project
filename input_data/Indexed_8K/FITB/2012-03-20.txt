(d) As previously reported, on November 28, 2011 the Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp (the "Registrant") elected Michael B. McCallister as a Director. The Board of Directors increased the size of the Board to fourteen Directors and appointed Mr. McCallister as a Director to fill the vacancy created by the increase. The Board had not yet determined which committees that Mr. McCallister was to be appointed at the time of the filing of the original report.
Mr. McCallister's compensation for service as a Director will be consistent with that of the Registrant's other non-employee directors, as described in the Registrant's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 8, 2012 and the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
A copy of the related press release was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the original report.
This amendment is being filed to report that on March 20, 2012, the Board of Directors appointed McCallister to the Audit Committee.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
