Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On March 21, 2012, in connection with the initial public offering of Vantiv, Inc. ("Vantiv"), indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Fifth Third Bancorp ("Fifth Third") received Class B Common Stock of Vantiv entitling them to elect two directors to the board of directors of Vantiv (the "Class B Directors"), and on that date, Greg D. Carmichael, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Fifth Third, and Paul L. Reynolds, Executive Vice President, Secretary and Chief Risk Officer of Fifth Third, were elected to the board of directors of Vantiv as the Class B Directors.
After the initial public offering of Vantiv, each of Messrs. Carmichael and Reynolds will receive compensation from Vantiv for their service as directors, which will consist of the following:
 
 
On March 21, 2012, each of Messrs. Carmichael and Reynolds received a grant of 7,058 restricted stock units, which will vest on the earlier of one year from the date of the grant or the next annual stockholder meeting and will be settled in shares of Class A common stock following the termination of the director's service.
None of the aforementioned compensation will be paid by Fifth Third. The terms of the compensation paid to Messrs. Carmichael and Reynolds by Vantiv are the same as the terms of the compensation paid to all other directors of Vantiv, other than its chairman and its chief executive officer.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On March 22, 2012, Fifth Third issued a press release announcing certain information relating to Vantiv's initial public offering.
A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Exhibit 99.1  Press Release dated March 22, 2012
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq: FITB) today announced the following estimated effects to Fifth Third related to the recent actions of Vantiv Inc. ("Vantiv").
Cincinnati
Vantiv recently priced an initial public offering of its Class A shares ("the offering"). As a result of this offering, we expect to recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately $95 million (approximately $60 million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2012. Following the offering, Fifth Third continues to hold approximately 86 million Class B units of Vantiv Holding, LLC which may be exchanged for Class A Common Stock of Vantiv, Inc. on a one-for-one basis, as well as a warrant that is exercisable and exchangeable into Vantiv Inc. Class A Common Stock. These securities are subject to certain terms and restrictions.
Additionally, the underwriters of the offering have been granted an option, solely to cover over-allotments and exercisable for 30 days from the date of pricing, to purchase up to an additional 15 percent of the number of shares of common stock offered in the offering (exclusive of such over-allotment option) at the IPO share price. Any such option would be fulfilled by shares of the pre-offering owners of Vantiv (and ratably between Fifth Third and Advent International). Should this option be fully exercised, it would result in an additional pre-tax gain of approximately $17 million (approximately $11 million after-tax) to Fifth Third in the quarter that the option is exercised.
If the underwriters' option is fully exercised, we would have a remaining economic interest of approximately 39 percent of Vantiv's future earnings; if not exercised, our remaining economic interest would be approximately 40 percent. Our interest is accounted for under the equity method.
As previously announced on March 13, 2012, our plan to repurchase shares in an amount up to any after-tax gains realized by Fifth Third from the sale of Vantiv common shares was not objected to by the Federal Reserve in its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process.
As described in Vantiv's S-1 and in connection with the IPO, Vantiv plans to refinance its existing bank debt facilities in which Fifth Third is a participating lender. According to the S-1, Vantiv expects to record termination and other charges related to this refinancing, which we would expect to reduce Fifth Third's equity method earnings attributable to Vantiv by approximately $36 million pre-tax in the first quarter of 2012. The actual reduction in equity method earnings will depend on prevailing interest rates at the time of the refinancing. Fifth Third's future equity method earnings would benefit from a reduction in Vantiv's borrowing costs, which would be partially offset by a modest reduction in Fifth Third's quarterly net interest income earned as a lender to Vantiv.
Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Company has $117 billion in assets and operates 15 affiliates with 1,315 full-service Banking Centers, including 105 Bank Mart locations open seven days a week inside select grocery stores and 2,414 ATMs in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Georgia and North Carolina. Fifth Third operates four main businesses: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Investment Advisors. Following Vantiv Inc.'s initial public offering, Fifth Third will have an interest of approximately 40% in Vantiv Holding, LLC, formerly Fifth Third Processing Solutions, LLC. Fifth Third is among the largest money managers in the Midwest and, as of December 31, 2011, had $282 billion in assets under care, of which it managed $24 billion for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations. and can be viewed at .
