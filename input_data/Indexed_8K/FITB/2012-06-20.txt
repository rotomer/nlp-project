Copies of these documents as revised will be filed with Fifth Third's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2012.
 
 
(d) In light of the approval at the April 17, 2012 Annual Meeting by its shareholders in an advisory vote of its recommendation to hold an advisory vote for the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers every 1 year, Fifth Third will include a shareholder vote on the compensation of executives in its proxy materials every 1 year until its next vote on the frequency of shareholder votes on the compensation of executives.
