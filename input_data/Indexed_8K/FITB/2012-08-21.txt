99.1  Fifth Third Bancorp Press Release dated August 21, 2012 (solely "furnished" and not "filed" for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ: FITB) announced today that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("the Federal Reserve") did not object to the proposed capital actions through March 31, 2013 (the "CCAR period") included in Fifth Third's capital plan submitted in June under the Comprehensive Capital & Analysis Review ("CCAR") process. The capital plan included the potential increase of the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.10 in the third quarter of 2012 and the potential repurchase of common shares.

Fifth Third also announced that its Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to 100 million shares, which replaces the previous authorization from 2007 under which approximately 14 million shares remained. Fifth Third's capital plan included potential common share repurchases of up to $600 million through the first quarter of 2013, in addition to any incremental repurchases related to any after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv, Inc. ("Vantiv") stock. Fifth Third expects to initiate share repurchases shortly by entering into a contract with a counterparty for the repurchase on its behalf of $350 million in value of common shares, subject to market conditions. Fifth Third's Board is expected to consider the possibility of a dividend increase at its regularly scheduled meeting in September.
In comments related to this announcement, Kevin Kabat, president and CEO of Fifth Third, said, "Our capital plan reflects our strong capital base, profitability and earnings generation, which enable us to increase our return of capital to shareholders while retaining more than sufficient capital to support ongoing business opportunities and balance sheet growth. We believe our plan for capital management and retention is a balanced and prudent one given our expectations, our capital position under current and proposed regulatory capital rules, and the current economic outlook."
The Federal Reserve's non-objection applies only to those actions proposed in Fifth Third's CCAR submission to be taken through March 31, 2013. Any actions that Fifth Third may plan or intend to take subsequent to that date would be subject to the CCAR plan submission for that subsequent period. Any capital distributions, including those contemplated in the above announced actions, are subject to evaluation and approval by the Board of Directors at any given time, Fifth Third's performance, the state of the economic environment, market conditions, regulatory factors, and other risks and uncertainties. Fifth Third has no current information and makes no representations as to whether, when or in what amounts there may be future gains
from the sale of Vantiv stock. The new repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date, does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or one or more private negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time.
