PORTLAND, Ore.October 17, 2002 announced today that net earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 2002 increased 73% to a third quarter record $10.7 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for the third quarter of 2001 of $6.2 million, or $0.38 per diluted share. Revenue increased 36% to a third quarter record $64.5 million from $47.5 million for the same period last year.

For the nine months, 2002 net earnings increased 84% to $28.9 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, from $15.7 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for the nine months of 2001. Revenue for the nine month period increased 25% to $186.2 million from $149.4 million for the same period last year.
 
The increase in revenue for the third quarter of 2002 reflected higher sales of FLIR's imaging products, particularly its airborne and ground-based imaging systems, which increased 48% over the same period last year, and an increase in sales of the Company's thermography products, which increased 19% over the same period last year. Gross margins were 53% compared to 55% for the same period last year. Earnings from operations increased 44% to $12.8 million, or 20% of revenue, for the 2002 third quarter compared to $8.9 million, or 19% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2001.
 
"In addition to excellent revenue and earnings growth from both our Imaging and Thermography Divisions for the third quarter, we also achieved a 20 percent operating margin and generated a record $23 million in cash from operations, underscoring the strength of our balance sheet. This puts us in an excellent position as we enter the fourth quarter and 2003," said FLIR President and CEO Earl R. Lewis.
 
Announces Authorization To Repurchase Shares
 
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has approved the repurchase of up to 1.5 million shares of FLIR common stock from time to time in open market or private transactions at the sole discretion of management. "In the interests of building value for our shareholders, we believe that it makes sense for the Company to have the flexibility to repurchase shares whenever we see an opportunity to do so on favorable terms," Lewis said.
