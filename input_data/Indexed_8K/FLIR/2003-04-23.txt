Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
PORTLAND, Ore.  April 22, 2003  announced today that revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 increased 19% to $69.2 million from $58.1 million for the first quarter of 2002. Income before taxes increased 34% to $13.7 million from $10.2 million. Net earnings for this year's first quarter increased 6% to $9.2 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, reflecting a 33% tax rate. This compares to net earnings for the first quarter of 2002 of $8.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, reflecting a 15% tax rate.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
Thermography product revenue increased 21% over the first quarter last year, primarily because of higher sales of the company's new E-Series handheld cameras. Imaging product revenue increased 18%, reflecting sales gains for both the Company's ground-based and airborne Imaging systems.
 
The backlog of orders grew to approximately $113 million at March 31, 2003, as compared to $92 million at December 31, 2002.
 
"Our first quarter 2003 financial performance puts FLIR in an excellent position to accomplish our goals for 2003. I am particularly encouraged by our healthy book-to-bill ratio during a normally slower quarter in terms of orders," said President and CEO Earl R. Lewis.
 
Cash generated from operations totaled $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2003. The Company has no outstanding debt and cash on hand of approximately $48 million.
 
Reiterates Revenue and Earnings Guidance for 2003
 
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
As previously announced, the Company continues to estimate revenue for 2003 in the range of $290 to $300 million, and net earnings of approximately $2.35 to $2.45 per diluted share, reflecting an estimated tax rate of 32%-34% versus 15% in 2002.
