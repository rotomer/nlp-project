PORTLAND, Ore.  July 23, 2003  announced today that revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003 increased 18% to $75.2 million from $63.6 million for the second quarter of 2002. Earnings from operations increased 34% to $15.5 million, or 21% of revenue, from $11.6 million, or 18% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2002. Net earnings for this year's second quarter increased 2% to $9.7 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, reflecting a 33% tax rate. This compares to net earnings for the second quarter of 2002 of $9.6 million, also at $0.27 per diluted share, reflecting a 15% tax rate.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
For the first half of 2003, revenue increased 19% to $144.3 million from $121.7 million for the same period last year. Earnings from operations for the first six months of 2003 increased 33% to $29.2 million, or 20% of revenue, from $22.0 million, or 18% of revenue, for the first half of 2002. Net earnings for that period increased 4% to $18.9 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $18.2 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2002. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split that was effective on May 29, 2003.
Thermography product revenue for the second quarter increased 38% over the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher sales of the Company's new E-Series handheld cameras and favorable currency exchange rates. Imaging product revenue increased 9%, reflecting sales gains for the Company's ground-based and maritime Imaging systems.
The backlog of orders grew to approximately $119 million at June 30, 2003, as compared to $113 million at March 31, 2003. Cash generated from operations totaled $3.5 million for the second quarter of 2003. At June 30, 2003, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $204 million, which includes approximately $150 million from the placement of convertible notes and the concurrent repurchase of the Company's common stock.
"Our financial performance in the second quarter continued to demonstrate strong demand for our full range of products. I am particularly encouraged by both the increase in our backlog and the significant increase in sales of our Thermography systems. The Company is well positioned to achieve our goals for 2003 as we head into the second half, which is seasonally our strongest part of the year," said President and CEO Earl R. Lewis.
