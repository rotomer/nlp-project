EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
PORTLAND, Ore.  October 22, 2003  announced today that revenue for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003 increased 9% to $70.2 million from $64.5 million for the third quarter of 2002. Earnings from operations increased 39% to $17.8 million, or 25% of revenue, a record high, compared with $12.8 million, or 20% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2002. Net earnings for this year's third quarter increased 2% to $10.9 million, or $0.32 per diluted share compared to net earnings for the third quarter of 2002 of $10.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. The effective annual tax rate for 2003 is 32% versus 15% in 2002.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
For the first nine months of 2003, revenue increased 15% to $214.6 million from $186.1 million for the same period last year. Earnings from operations for the 2003 period increased 35% to $47.0 million, or 22% of revenue, from $34.8 million, or 19% of revenue, for the first nine months of 2002. Net earnings increased 3% to $29.7 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $28.9 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2002. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split that was effective on May 29, 2003.
 
Both of FLIR's business lines benefited from increased revenue and higher margins in the third quarter. In particular, the Sweden and Boston operations achieved significant margin improvement during the quarter. Thermography revenue for the 2003 quarter increased 15% over the third quarter last year, as a result of higher sales of the Company's P-Series, E-Series and new A20 handheld cameras, as well as the impact of favorable currency exchange rates. Imaging product revenue increased 5%, reflecting sales gains for the Company's airborne law enforcement and maritime Imaging systems.
 
The company's firm order backlog, defined as funded contracts for delivery within the next twelve months, grew 24% during the third quarter, to approximately $148 million at September 30, 2003, as compared to $119 million at June 30, 2003, reflecting strong order bookings in the maritime, ground and airborne segments of the Imaging business. Cash generated from operations totaled $11.0 million for the third quarter of 2003. At September 30, 2003, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $203 million. During the third quarter, the company repurchased approximately $13 million of its common stock in the open market.

Earl Lewis, President and CEO, stated "I am extremely pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. In particular, I am encouraged by the increase in our backlog and the significant margin improvement during the quarter. Both our Boston operations and our Sweden Thermography business enjoyed margin improvement during the quarter. As we have stated, our business will naturally experience quarterly fluctuations, particularly in revenue, but the operating leverage inherent in our business model, and our continued focus on managing operating expenses enables us to achieve consistent profit growth. The Company is well positioned for an excellent fourth quarter, and to achieve our goals for the year."
