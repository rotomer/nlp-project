99.1 Press Release issued by FLIR Systems, Inc. on October 20, 2004.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized on October 20, 2004.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
PORTLAND, Ore.  October 20, 2004  announced today that revenue for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004 increased 58% to $110.8 million from $70.2 million for the third quarter of 2003. Earnings from operations increased 44% to $25.7 million, or 23% of revenue, compared with $17.8 million, or 25% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2003. Net earnings for this year's third quarter increased 55% to $16.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted share compared to net earnings for the third quarter of 2003 of $10.9 million, or $0.32 per diluted share.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
For the first nine months of 2004, revenue increased 58% to $338.9 million from $214.6 million for the same period last year. Earnings from operations for the first nine months of 2004 increased 59% to $74.7 million, or 22% of revenue, from $47.0 million, or 22% of revenue, for the first nine months of 2003. Net earnings increased 60% to $47.4 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $29.7 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2003.
 
Revenue from the Company's Thermography products increased 35% over the third quarter last year, as a result of strong demand across all products and markets. Revenue from the Company's Imaging products increased 72% in the third quarter. During the quarter, airborne Imaging markets were particularly strong.
 
The backlog of orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $178 million at September 30, 2004, compared to $183 million at June 30, 2004.
 
Cash generated from operations totaled $22 million for the third quarter of 2004, and $61 million for the first nine months of 2004. At September 30, 2004, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $95 million.
 
Earl Lewis, President and CEO, stated "I am pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. Our growth over the third quarter of last year was very strong, and we achieved solid results across all markets and product lines. As we had announced, our earnings per share were less than in the second quarter, due to seasonal factors and a slower than usual end to the government fiscal year. Nevertheless, all of our businesses are performing well, and our outlook for the business has not changed. We expect our usual strong fourth quarter results, and are thus reaffirming guidance for the full year 2004."
 
Effect of Convertible Notes on Earnings Per Share
 
In June, 2003, the Company issued $210 million of 3% Senior Convertible Notes, due 2023. The Notes are convertible into FLIR common stock at a conversion price of $44.38 per share. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company met certain requirements that allow holders of the Notes to convert their Notes into shares of FLIR common stock. As a result, the 4.7 million shares underlying the Notes have been included in the Company's diluted share count for the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the effect of the additional dilutive shares, earnings per share would have been $0.47.

In addition, a recent accounting pronouncement that is expected to be effective in the fourth quarter of 2004 will require that the underlying shares related to the Notes be included in the Company's diluted share count retroactive to the date of issuance in June 2003. As a result, the Company anticipates restating its diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2004 for prior periods dating back to the second quarter of 2003. This pronouncement impacts only the calculation of diluted earnings per share, and has no effect on the reporting or determination of the Company's net income.
 
Based on the Company's interpretation of the new accounting rules, the impact of the restatement will be to reduce fiscal 2003 fully diluted earnings per share by $.02 to $1.25 per share, from a previously reported $1.27 per share.
 
The impact of the diluted earnings per share restatement in the first nine months of 2004 would be to reduce fully diluted earnings per share to $1.26 per share from a reported $1.30 per share.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for 2004
 
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
Based on the Company's financial results for the first nine months of 2004, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, management currently expects revenue for 2004 to be approximately $470 million to $480 million and fully diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.86. Excluding the effect of the dilutive shares related to the Notes, the new earnings per share outlook is the same as prior guidance of $1.88 to $1.98 per diluted share.
