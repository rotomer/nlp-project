"2004 was another excellent year for FLIR. We achieved record revenue and net earnings as both of our divisions grew strongly. We also made progress toward many of our longer term objectives, including the integration of Indigo Systems, which was acquired last January, and the expansion of our global Thermography distribution network," commented Earl R. Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "Looking to 2005, we expect growth to moderate somewhat from the very rapid pace of 2004, but remain strong. We are thus reiterating our outlook for 2005 revenue and earnings per share. Our current expectation is for full year revenue in the range of $545 to $560 million, and net earnings in the range of $1.12 to $1.18 per fully diluted share, after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split effective today. We are very proud of FLIR's accomplishments in 2004 and are excited about the prospects for 2005 and beyond," he concluded.
