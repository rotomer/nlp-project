 July 19, 2006  announced today that revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006 increased 6% to $138.6 million from $131.0 million for the second quarter of 2005, due to higher revenue from the Company's Thermography and Commercial Vision Systems divisions. Earnings from operations decreased 10% to $29.0 million, or 21% of revenue, compared with $32.3 million, or 25% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2005. The decline in earnings from operations was attributable to lower profitability in the Company's Government Systems division, the impact of stock based compensation expense and higher selling and marketing expenses, particularly in the Thermography and Commercial Vision Systems divisions. Net earnings per fully diluted share totaled $0.28, as compared to net earnings per fully diluted share of $0.31 in the second quarter of 2005.

For the first six months of 2006, revenue increased 7% to $255.9 million from $239.3 million for the same period last year. Earnings from operations for the first six months of 2006 decreased 10% to $47.9 million, or 19% of revenue, from $53.5 million, or 22% of revenue, for the first six months of 2005. Net earnings per fully diluted share for the quarter was $0.45, as compared to net earnings per fully diluted share of $0.50 per diluted share for the first six months of 2005.
Revenue from the Company's Thermography Division increased 15% over the second quarter last year, to $51.8 million, as a result of the recent introduction of several new products, including the InfraCAM and the upgraded ThermoVision E-Series camera line. During the quarter the Thermography Division also introduced the all new P-Series camera, the P640.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems Division decreased by 6% in the second quarter to $62.0 million, due in part to lower sales of land-based products in the Division's Boston facility.

Revenue from the Company's Commercial Vision Systems Division increased 25% over the second quarter of last year, to $24.8 million, reflecting strength in the automotive, maritime and OEM businesses.
The backlog of orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $173 million at June 30, 2006, compared to $201 million at March 31, 2006. Lower backlog was attributable to the order delays in the Government Systems Division, both domestically and internationally.
Cash generated from operations totaled $20 million for the second quarter of 2006, and $54 million for the first six months of the year. At June 30, 2006, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $143 million. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 278,000 shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of approximately $25 per share.
Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR, stated "Overall second quarter results were consistent with our expectations. Both the Thermography and Commercial Vision Systems divisions saw continued good revenue growth and profitability growth in the quarter and the first half of the year. We expect both of these divisions to continue to do well in the second half. Government Systems Division revenue and orders were less than our expectations. We are slightly lowering our revenue expectations for the year, reflecting continued softness in Government Systems, but maintaining earnings per share guidance within our original range. We believe the long term outlook for the Government Systems business is improving, and expect faster growth in the future. Our selection by Bell as the provider of the Target Acquisition Sensor Suite for the US Army's Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program is only one of several significant program opportunities for our BRITE Star II system. Production in our Boston facility is improving, and we expect to see better results there in the second half of the year," he concluded.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for 2006
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Based on its financial results for the first six months of 2006, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, management currently expects revenue for 2006 to be in the range of $570 million to $580 million. This compares with management's previous expectations for 2006 revenue of $590 million to $600 million. Management currently expects earnings per share for 2006 to be in the previously-announced range of $1.20 to $1.30.
