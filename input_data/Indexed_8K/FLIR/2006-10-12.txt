On October 6, 2006, FLIR Systems, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (the "Company") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Agreement') with a group of banks including Bank of America, N.A., Union Bank of California, N.A, U.S. Bank National Association and other lenders identified therein. The Agreement provides for a $300 million revolving credit facility with sublimits for multi currency borrowings, letters of credit and swingline loans. The Agreement expires on October 6, 2011. The Company has the option to request an increase in the revolving credit facility up to $150 million over the term of the Agreement. Each lender has the right, but not the obligation, to commit to all or a portion of any proposed increase.
Under the Agreement, borrowings will bear interest based upon the prime lending rate of the Bank of America or Eurodollar rates with a provision for a spread under/over such Eurodollar rates based upon the Company's leverage ratio as defined in the Agreement.
Borrowings under the Agreement will be used for lawful corporate purposes including, but not limited to, the financing of future acquisitions, the refinancing of existing indebtedness, working capital needs, capital expenditures, and purchases of common stock of the Company.
The Agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets, dividends and stock repurchases. The Agreement also includes certain financial covenants that require, among other things, the maintenance of a total debt leverage ratio of no more than 4.0 to 1.0, the maintenance of a senior debt leverage ratio of no more than 3.0 to 1.0, and the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.0. The Agreement also includes usual and customary events of default, including, but not limited to, the failure to pay interest or principal when due, the failure to perform or observe covenants of the Agreement, insolvency or bankruptcy, change of control and certain judgment defaults. The Agreement is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets.
On October 6, 2006, the Company had $56.5 million outstanding under the Agreement and had $5.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Agreement, which reduces the total available credit.
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
On October 6, 2006, the Company used funds borrowed under the Agreement to repay the outstanding amounts under the existing $100 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated April 28, 2004, among the Company as borrowers, and Bank of America, N.A., Union Bank of California, N.A, U.S. Bank National Association. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was terminated upon repayment.

(f) The provisions of this are made for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by any such Person from time to time against any of the Domestic Borrowers as often as occasion therefore may arise and without requirement on the part of any Lender first to marshal any of its claims or to exercise any of its rights against any other Loan Party or to exhaust any remedies available to it against any other Loan Party or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this shall remain in effect until all the Obligations hereunder shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied.

Article IV
 
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Loan Parties hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, that if any Loan Party shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided
(b) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, each Loan Party shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) Each Loan Party agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer for (i) the full amount of Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the L/C Issuer and (ii) any liability (including penalties, interest
 
and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payment under this subsection (c) shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
(i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
(ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,
(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent shareholder" of the applicable Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or
(iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender's status for U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Company, as the Administrative Agent or the Company shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter,
 
such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Lender, as are required under such Laws to confirm such Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the United States by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction. Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes or Other Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Loan Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction.
 
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
 
If the Administrative Agent determines in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or (c) that the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of
 
funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company and all Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein to the extent available (or, in the case of a pending request for a Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Company and the Lenders may establish a mutually acceptable alternative rate).
 
(a) If any Lender or the L/C Issuer reasonably determines that as a result of any Change in Law, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender or the L/C Issuer is organized or has its Lending Office, (iii) reserve requirements utilized, as to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate and (iv) the requirements of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank reflected in the Mandatory Cost, other than as set forth below)) or the Mandatory Cost, as calculated hereunder, does not represent the cost to such Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, then from time to time upon demand of such Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C Issuer such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer for such increased cost or reduction or, if applicable, the portion of such cost that is not represented by the Mandatory Cost.
Section 3.01
(b) If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer (or its Lending Office or holding company) has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender, the L/C Issuer or its holding company as a consequence of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its (and its holding company's) policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's or its holding company's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C Issuer such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such holding company for such reduction.
 
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
 
(b) any failure by any Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower;
(c) any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) in a different currency from such Loan or Letter of Credit drawing; or
(d) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to ;
Section 11.13
including any loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The Company shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company (or the applicable Designated Borrower) to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Base Rate used in determining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank eurodollar market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
Section 3.05
 
(a) A certificate of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender claiming compensation under this and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods if applied consistently to all similarly situated borrowers.
Article III
(b) Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation under or or requiring a conversion of Loans under , the Company may replace such Lender in accordance with .
Section 3.01
3.04
Section 3.02
Section 11.13
(c) If any Loan Party is required to pay any amount to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this , then such Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall, at the expense of the Company, use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the reasonable judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Loan Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements, the obligations of each Guarantor (in its capacity as such) under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under the Debtor Relief Laws or any comparable provisions of any applicable Law.

(iv) any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any holder of Obligations as security for any of the Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or

The obligations of each Guarantor under this shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as a result of any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each holder of the Obligations on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such holder of the Obligations in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any Debtor Relief Law.
Article IV
 
Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (a) the guaranty given hereby may be enforced without the necessity of resorting to or otherwise exhausting remedies in respect of any other security or collateral interests, and without the necessity at any time of having to take recourse against the Borrowers hereunder or against any collateral securing the Obligations or otherwise, and (b) it will not assert any right to require that action first be taken against the Borrowers or any other Person (including any co-guarantor) or pursuit of any other remedy or enforcement any other right, and (c) nothing contained herein shall prevent or limit action being taken against the Borrowers hereunder, under the other Loan Documents or the other documents and agreements relating to the Obligations or, foreclosure on any security or collateral interests relating hereto or thereto, or the exercise of any other rights or remedies available in respect thereof, if neither the Borrowers nor the Guarantors shall timely perform their obligations, and the exercise of any such rights and completion of any such foreclosure proceedings shall not constitute a discharge of the Guarantors' obligations hereunder unless as a result thereof, the Obligations shall have been paid in full and the commitments relating thereto shall have expired or terminated, it being the purpose and intent that the Guarantors' obligations hereunder be absolute, irrevocable, independent and unconditional under all circumstances.
