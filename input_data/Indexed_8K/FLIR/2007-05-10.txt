Item 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
. The US-based named executive officers of FLIR Systems, Inc. (the "Company") have entered into stock trading plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Previously, by Company policy, named executive officers were limited to one trading period per calendar year. Under the terms of the respective trading plans, the officers will sell shares of the Company's common stock either acquired through the exercise of currently unexercised stock options or shares previously acquired. The trading plans specify the time and the maximum number of shares to be sold, subject to certain limit prices. The number of shares subject to each trading plan and the duration of each such plan for each of the officers is as set forth below.
Adoption of 10b5-1 Trading Plans
 
All sales by the officers under the trading plans will be disclosed publicly through appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company's non US-based executive officer, Arne Almerfors, has also announced his intention to exercise options and sell up to 70,000 shares of the Company's common stock in the open trading window following the Company's earnings release for its fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2007.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized on May 10, 2007.
