Revenue from the Company's Commercial Vision Systems division increased 49% over the second quarter of last year, to $36.9 million, reflecting growth across all major product lines. Revenue from the Company's Thermography division increased 11% over the second quarter of last year, to $57.4 million, primarily due to strong demand in both the upper and lower ends of the market.
The backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $311 million at June 30, 2007, an increase of $31 million from $280 million at March 31, 2007. Backlog in the Government System's division was $245 million, up $29 million during the quarter, primarily due to orders for stabilized, multi-sensor systems for the U.S. military. Backlog in the Commercial Vision System's division was $54 million, up $2 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Thermography division was $11 million, flat with the prior quarter.

Cash used in operations during the quarter was $4 million, as net income for the quarter was offset by tax payments and increases in accounts receivable and inventory. At June 30, 2007, cash and cash equivalents were $152 million, down $1 million from $153 million at March 31, 2007.
"Overall, the successful start to the year we experienced last quarter continued throughout the second quarter," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO. "Demand was excellent, particularly in our Government Systems and Commercial Vision Systems divisions, as backlog at the end of the quarter again set a record at $311 million. Based on the quarter's results, and the expectations for the remainder of the year, we are once again increasing our guidance for the year."
