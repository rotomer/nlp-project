Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
On September 13, 2007, FLIR Systems, Inc., an Oregon corporation ("FLIR"), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement'") with the two principal shareholders (the "Sellers") of Cedip Infrared Systems, a company organized and existing under the laws of France ("Cedip"). Cedip is a leading provider of infrared cameras and stabilized gimbaled systems. Cedip is listed on the French Alternext stock market. The Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, FLIR will purchase from the Sellers 2,047,500 shares of capital stock of Cedip (the "Shares"), which represent approximately 63.7% of the share capital of Cedip on a fully diluted basis. FLIR has also entered into separate Share Purchase Agreements (the "Additional Agreements") with three other shareholders of Cedip with respect to a total of 131,000 additional shares of capital stock of Cedip (the "Additional Shares") representing approximately 4.1% of the share capital of Cedip on a fully diluted basis . The purchase price for the Shares and the Additional Shares is EUR 19 per share, or an aggregate of approximately EUR 41.4 million (approximately $57.1 million).
The purchase of the Shares is subject to various closing conditions, including the authorization of the French Minister of Finance and Economy pursuant to the French Monetary and Financial Code. If the Acquisition is completed, FLIR is obligated to launch a mandatory Standing Market Offer in France pursuant to which FLIR will undertake to buy all of the remaining outstanding shares of Cedip at a price of EUR 19 per share. In the event that upon completion of the Standing Market Offer, FLIR owns at least 95 percent of the share capital and voting rights of Cedip, the price per share paid to all shareholders of Cedip will be increased to EUR 19.50 per share. If commenced, the Standing Market Order is expected to be completed by the end of January 2008. In the event that FLIR purchases all of the outstanding shares of Cedip, total consideration paid will be approximately EUR 62.7 million (approximately $86.4 million).
