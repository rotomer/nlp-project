Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
    On November 7, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed for lack of standing four consolidated derivative lawsuits that were pending against certain current and former officers, directors, and employees of FLIR Systems, Inc. ("the Company"). The consolidated complaint alleged the backdating of certain stock options granted at various times between 1996 and 2001.
    As previously disclosed, in late 2006 the Company's Board of Directors ("the Board") appointed a Special Committee of outside directors to investigate the Company's historical option granting practices and related accounting treatment. The Special Committee conducted an investigation with the assistance of independent legal counsel and independent forensic accountants. Following the completion of its investigation and its report to the Board, the Special Committee sought the advice and assistance of its independent legal counsel in evaluating the nature, strength, and expense of pursuing any claims based on the findings of the investigation. After its evaluation, the Special Committee recommended that the Board not pursue litigation of these claims. Based on the Special Committee's recommendation and the exercise of the Board's own business judgment, the directors voted to approve and adopt the Special Committee's recommendation.
    Another lawsuit filed on behalf of the Company in early August 2007 and raising the same issues asserted in the dismissed consolidated complaint is still pending.
