FLIR Systems Announces Third Quarter 2009 Financial Results
Operating Earnings Increase by 17% on Record Operating Margins; Announces Acquisition of OmniTech Partners, Inc.
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - October 21, 2009) - FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009. Revenue was $285.6 million, up 3% compared to third quarter 2008 revenue of $276.7 million. Operating income in the third quarter was $89.3 million, up 17% from $76.7 million in the third quarter of 2008. Third quarter 2009 net income was $60.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with net income of $54.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the third quarter a year ago. Cash provided by operations during the quarter was $67.4 million.
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $835.5 million, up 8% compared to revenue for the first nine months of 2008 of $774.6 million. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $257.3 million, up 31% from the same period a year ago. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $170.0 million, or $1.07 a diluted share, compared with net income of $135.9 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operations for the first nine months of 2009 was $199.4 million.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division increased 7% over the third quarter of 2008, to $163.0 million, with strength in stabilized gimbaled systems. Revenue from the Company's Commercial Vision Systems division increased 15% over the third quarter of last year, to $52.6 million, reflecting growth in the security, cores and components, and maritime markets. Revenue from the Company's Thermography division decreased 12% from the third quarter of last year, to $69.9 million, primarily due to lower demand for high-value products for the predictive maintenance market.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $608 million at September 30, 2009, an increase of $10 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Government System's division was $487 million, up $20 million during the quarter due to strong U.S. demand. Backlog in the Commercial Vision Systems division was $93 million, down $15 million during the quarter due to a significant order cancellation resulting from a delay in project timing. Backlog in the Thermography division was $28 million, up $5 million during the quarter.
Earnings Outlook for 2009
Based on the financial results for the quarter, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, the Company expects full year 2009 earnings per share to be slightly above the most recent outlook.
Acquisition of OmniTech Partners, Inc.
The Company announced today it has acquired OmniTech Partners, Inc., a leader in the development and manufacturing of image intensified and fused image intensified / thermal imagers based in Freeport, PA, for $42 million in cash. OmniTech adds image intensified capability to FLIR's product line, and creates the opportunity to leverage the capabilities of both companies to expand in the growing market for fused image intensified / thermal imagers. OmniTech currently forecasts annual revenue of $22 million for the year ending December 31, 2009. The transaction is expected to be immaterial to FLIR's earnings in 2009 and 2010.
"We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Operating margins were at record levels, operating cash flow was excellent, and backlog increased $20 million in our Government Systems division, improving 2010 visibility," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO. "With low cost, increasing brand awareness, and a diversified revenue base and growing product lines, the Company is executing its strategy effectively and is well positioned for future growth. I am delighted to welcome the talented people at OmniTech to the FLIR team."
