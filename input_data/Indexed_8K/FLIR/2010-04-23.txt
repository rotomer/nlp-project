Based on its financial results for the first quarter of 2010, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, management today is reaffirming its outlook for revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2010. Management currently expects revenue for 2010 to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately 9% compared with 2009, and net earnings to be in the range of $1.48 to $1.53 per diluted share, an increase of approximately 4% compared with 2009.
"I am very pleased with our first quarter performance. Our commercial businesses had solid growth year-over-year and Government Systems was little changed, as expected.

"We are seeing a good recovery in our commercial businesses, and expect them to grow nicely for the remainder of 2010 and beyond. The Government Systems division is on track to meet our expectations as we expand our sales footprint and marketing activities to position us for long term growth. As a company, we continue to focus on efficient operations, broad distribution, high quality products, and leadership in promising growth markets."
