FLIR Systems Announces Second Quarter 2010 Financial Results
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - July 22, 2010) - FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010. Revenue was $331.1 million, up 19% compared to second quarter 2009 revenue of $278.0 million. Excluding the impact of the Raymarine acquisition, second quarter revenue was $303.9 million, an increase of 9%. Operating income in the second quarter was $89.8 million, up 6% from $84.7 million in the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter 2010 net income was $59.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared with net income of $55.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the second quarter a year ago. The tax rate in the second quarter was 34.6%, an increase of 2.6 percentage points compared with the second quarter of 2009, due primarily to non-deductible acquisition expenses, and the lack of R & D tax credits which benefitted prior periods. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $42.7 million.
During the second quarter, Raymarine contributed $27.2 million of revenue and $3.4 million of operating income. Acquisition-related costs and expenses associated with post acquisition restructuring totaled $4.6 million in the quarter and $5.8 million in the first half of the year.
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $618.4 million, up 12% compared to revenue for the first six months of 2009 of $550.0 million. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $174.2 million, up 4% from the same period a year ago. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $115.3 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with net income of $109.9 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operations for the first six months of 2010 was $124.9 million.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division increased 5% from the second quarter of 2009, to $167.9 million. Revenue from the Company's Commercial Systems division increased 16% from the second quarter of 2009, to $136.0 million. Within the Commercial Systems' division, revenue from Commercial Vision Systems increased 27% from the second quarter of last year, to $64.7 million, reflecting strong growth in security, automotive, and personal vision systems. Revenue from Thermography increased 7% from the second quarter of last year, to $71.4 million, reflecting growth across multiple product lines.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $518 million at June 30, 2010, a decrease of $25 million during the quarter. The Raymarine acquisition added $17 million of backlog as of June 30, 2010. Backlog in the Government System's division was $375 million, down $43 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Commercial Vision Systems division was $104 million, up $3 million during the quarter, while backlog in the Thermography division was $22 million, down $2 million during the quarter.
"We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter as the Company continues to perform well across markets and geographies. We are especially pleased with recent growth and profitability trends in our Commercial Vision Systems business and with the continued strong operating margins generated by our Government Systems business. Our strategy to expand the market for infrared technology by driving down costs has delivered an outstanding operating model, balanced growth in uneven economic conditions, and numerous opportunities for future growth," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO.
