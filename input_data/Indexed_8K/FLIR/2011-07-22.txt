FLIR today also announced that it has acquired Aerius Photonics, LLC, a leading provider of short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) detectors and advanced laser components, for $27 million in cash.

"The second quarter finished with solid results for our Commercial Systems division, which posted one of its best growth quarters along with substantially improved profitability. Our Government Systems division was impacted by order and shipment delays," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "We are excited to add Aerius to our Commercial Systems business. Aerius will enhance our ability to serve OEMs in numerous sectors as well as augment our multi-spectral systems development capabilities."
Based on financial results for the first half of 2011 and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR is reducing its outlook for revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2011.
