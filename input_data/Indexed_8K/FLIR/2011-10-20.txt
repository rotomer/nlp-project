Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR, noted, "We are pleased with our third quarter results. During the quarter, we took successful steps to improve operating margins, achieved the best bookings quarter since 2008 in our legacy Government Systems business, saw our acquired Detection and Integrated Systems segments reach profitability for the first time, and delivered the most units in the history of our Commercial Systems division. Our scale, unique operating model, and continued focus on innovation will enable our continued growth."
Based on financial results for the first nine months of 2011 and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR is reaffirming its outlook for earnings per share for the full year 2011. Management currently expects net earnings excluding the net after tax impact of the second quarter litigation settlement and the third quarter severance costs to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.55 per diluted share, or $1.33 to $1.38 per diluted share including these costs. Management now expects revenue for the full year 2011 to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion, compared to the prior outlook for revenue in the range of $1.6 to $1.65 billion.
