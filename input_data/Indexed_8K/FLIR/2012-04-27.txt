FLIR Systems Announces First Quarter 2012 Financial Results
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - April 27, 2012) - (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012.

Operating income in the first quarter was $68.3 million, compared to $76.3 million in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 net income was $48.1 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net income of $51.3 million, or $0.32 per diluted share in the first quarter a year ago.

FLIR Systems, Inc.
Revenue from the Company's Commercial Systems division increased 4% from the first quarter of 2011, to $202.3 million. Within the Commercial Systems division, revenue from the Thermal Vision and Measurement segment was $155.7 million, an increase of 7% over the first quarter results last year. Commercial Systems' Raymarine segment contributed $46.6 million of revenue during the first quarter, down 8% from the prior year.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division decreased 19% from the first quarter of 2011, to $146.1 million. Within the Government Systems division, revenue from the Surveillance segment was $114.6 million, a decrease of 24% from the first quarter of 2011. Revenue from Government Systems' Detection segment was $19.4 million, an increase of 8% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Government Systems' Integrated Systems segment contributed $12.2 million of revenue during the first quarter, a decrease of 5% from the prior year.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $457 million as of March 31, 2012, an increase of $2 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Government Systems division was $312 million, decreasing $2 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Commercial Systems division was $145 million, up $4 million during the quarter.
"While not up to our standards, first quarter performance was about as anticipated," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "A difficult market environment impacted our Government Systems business, but we successfully stabilized backlog as Government Systems orders equaled revenue for the quarter. Our Commercial Systems business was slow in the first quarter, however, we continue to expect improved results as we go through the year. It is clearly our task to improve in the future, and we believe these efforts will show in the second half of 2012."
Based on financial results for the first three months of 2012 and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR is reaffirming its outlook for earnings per share for the full year 2012. Management expects net earnings to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share, and revenue for the full year 2012 to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion.
