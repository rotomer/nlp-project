FLIR Systems Announces Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - July 26, 2012) - (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012. Revenue was $338.3 million, down 14% compared to second quarter 2011 revenue of $391.6 million. Operating income in the second quarter was $60.7 million, compared to $41.8 million in the second quarter of 2011, and was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of approximately $6.8 million before tax. Second quarter 2012 net income was $41.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared with net income of $29.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in the second quarter a year ago. Excluding the net after tax impact of the restructuring costs referred to above, second quarter 2012 net income was $46.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $77.2 million. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $21.60 per share.
FLIR Systems, Inc.
Revenue from the Company's Commercial Systems division decreased 12% from the second quarter of 2011, to $189.8 million. Within the Commercial Systems division, revenue from the Thermal Vision and Measurement segment was $142.6 million, a decrease of 13% from the second quarter results last year. The Raymarine segment contributed $47.2 million of revenue during the second quarter, down 6% from the prior year.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division decreased 16% from the second quarter of 2011, to $148.5 million. Within the Government Systems division, revenue from the Surveillance segment was $119.5 million, a decrease of 16% from the second quarter of 2011. Revenue from the Detection segment was $15.7 million, a decrease of 9% compared to the second quarter of 2011, and the Integrated Systems segment contributed $13.3 million of revenue during the second quarter, a decrease of 26% from the prior year.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $498 million as of June 30, 2012, an increase of $41 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Government Systems division was $334 million, increasing $22 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Commercial Systems division was $164 million, up $19 million during the quarter.
"This second quarter proved difficult for our company," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "Macroeconomic conditions impacted many of our largest markets, but we continued to manage our business in response to these challenges. Both divisions had meaningful increases in backlog during the quarter, and we further streamlined our operations. While the first half of 2012 underperformed our expectations, we anticipate an improved second half and a return to earnings growth in the fourth quarter."
As announced previously, based on financial results for the first half of 2012 and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR has modified its outlook for revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2012. Management currently expects revenue for 2012 to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and net earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per diluted share. This compares to the prior outlook of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion in revenue and $1.60 to $1.70 in earnings per diluted share for the full year 2012.

FLIR's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share on FLIR common stock, payable September 7, 2012, to shareholders of record as of close of business on August 20, 2012.
