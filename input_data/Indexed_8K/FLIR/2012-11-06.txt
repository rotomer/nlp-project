Dear Ms. Yerger:
I write in response to your letter of July 31, 2012. At its recent meeting, the Board of Directors of FLIR Systems, Inc. (the "Board") determined that, in connection with the Company's 2013 Annual Meeting, it would put forth shareholder proposals that will (i) begin the process of eliminating the classification of the Board, and (ii) initiate the appropriate process to amend the Company's articles of incorporation to provide that director nominees will be elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast at each annual meeting of shareholders.
I trust the foregoing answers your inquiry.
Sincerely,
/s/ William W. Davis
William W. Davis Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary
