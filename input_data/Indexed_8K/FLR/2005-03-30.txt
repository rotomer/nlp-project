Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On March 30, 2005, the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Fluor Corporation ("Fluor") unanimously approved by written consent amendments to certain of Fluor's incentive plans that provide for the grant of incentive awards to its executive officers and directors (the "Plans"). The amendments prohibit the Company from providing financing to plan participants to pay the purchase price of plan awards, to pay the amount of taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to any plan awards or for any other purpose. The amendments do not affect the participants' ability to utilize a cashless exercise arrangement. These amendments reflect the policy that Fluor has maintained since July 2002, under which no new loans are allowed to be granted to any executive officers or directors of Fluor.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
