Item 8.01. Other Events.
Fluor Corporation reports that as of August 19, 2005, it has settled all outstanding disputes with the owners' consortium on the Hamaca Crude Upgrader Project in Jose, Venezuela. The pending arbitration proceedings will be dismissed forthwith. The settlement is intended to reimburse Fluor for its incurred costs arising from disputed change orders on the project and for its cost of capital in funding those incurred costs. As a result, in the third quarter, all project related costs previously deferred will be eliminated from Fluor's balance sheet and Fluor will recognize approximately $30 million in pre-tax earnings which primarily reflects Fluor's cost of capital associated with funding the incurred costs. The impact of this settlement was not included in Fluor's recently released earnings guidance for the year.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
