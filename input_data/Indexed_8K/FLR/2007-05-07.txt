NEW AWARDS UP 17 PERCENT TO $4.5 BILLION

EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 94 CENTS
IRVING, TEXAS,  May 7, 2007  Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2007.  Net earnings were $85 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared with $89 million, or $1.00 per diluted share for the same period last year.  Operating profit for the quarter was $177 million, compared with $184 million in the first quarter of 2006.  All business segments posted substantial growth over last year, with the exception of the Government segment which benefited from hurricane relief activities in the first quarter and throughout 2006.  Operating margin was 4.9 percent, compared with 5.1 percent a year ago.   Revenue of $3.6 billion was level with the first quarter of 2006.  Strong growth in Oil & Gas and Global Services revenue offset an expected decline in the Government segment.
New project awards for the first quarter were $4.5 billion, up 17 percent from $3.8 billion a year ago.  The quarter included $2.9 billion in Oil & Gas awards with the balance representing a broad-based mix across the other segments.  Consolidated backlog rose to a new company record of $23.7 billion, up 54 percent from a year ago and up 8 percent sequentially over the prior quarter.
 
 
"Fluor's operations posted very strong results, enabling us to largely offset the expected decline in contingency response work in the Government segment," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alan Boeckmann.   "We continue to win substantial new project awards across our diversified businesses which we expect will continue to drive growth in revenue, earnings and backlog."
Corporate G&A expense for the quarter was $45 million, compared with $42 million in the first quarter of 2006.  Fluor's financial position continues to strengthen, with cash and cash equivalents growing to $1.1 billion, up from $654 million a year ago.
Outlook
Earnings guidance reflects our expectation that continued broad-based growth will more than offset the lower contributions from the Government segment.  First quarter new awards were sizable and, while individual quarterly bookings may fluctuate due to the timing of major awards, we expect continued strength throughout 2007.  Oil & Gas represents the largest market opportunity, with Power, Industrial & Infrastructure and Global Services having solid prospects as well.  We are encouraged by the strength of first quarter performance, which has increased our confidence in delivering Earnings Per Share in a range of $3.50 to $3.80 per share for 2007.
Business Segments
Fluor's Oil & Gas segment reported first quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, up 41 percent from the first quarter of 2006.  Operating profit grew to $88 million, up 56 percent over 2006.  
 
 
Results reflect the significant ramp-up in new project awards over the last two years.  Operating margin was 5.3 percent, increasing from 4.8 percent a year ago.  New oil, gas and petrochemical awards in the first quarter totaled $2.9 billion, including a large award for the engineering, procurement and construction management of the utilities and off-site facilities for a major petrochemical complex in Saudi Arabia.  Ending backlog at March 31, 2007 for Oil & Gas rose to $14.0 billion, a 106 percent increase from a year ago.
Fluor's Industrial & Infrastructure segment reported revenue of $773 million, level with last year.  Operating profit was $21 million, a 55 percent increase over the first quarter a year ago.  Improved performance resulted from the strength of new awards over the last year including growing contributions from the mining business line.  New awards for the quarter were $414 million, primarily from mining and life sciences, compared with $672 million a year ago when a major infrastructure project was awarded.  Backlog rose to $5.2 billion, up 39 percent from $3.8 billion a year ago.
Revenue for the Government segment was $346 million for the first quarter, compared with $1.1 billion a year ago.  Operating profit was $16 million, down from $78 million a year ago, and operating margin declined to 4.7 percent from 6.9 percent last year.  The first quarter of 2006 benefited from contributions from hurricane relief work for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Iraq reconstruction work and the Fernald project.  First quarter new awards totaled $127 million, and ending backlog was $548 million.
 
 
The Global Services segment reported a 38 percent increase in revenue to $635 million in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in operations and maintenance (O&M) activity.  Operating profit grew by 32 percent to $47 million, reflecting strong growth from the O&M and equipment services business lines.  Operating margin was 7.4 percent compared with 7.8 percent last year.  New awards were $757 million and backlog was $2.5 billion at the end of the first quarter.
Fluor's Power segment reported revenue of $206 million, up substantially from $78 million in the first quarter of 2006.  Operating profit was $5 million in the first quarter, with an operating margin of 2.3 percent.  Power segment new awards were $261 million, including an award for the engineering, procurement and construction of a 570 megawatt combined cycle power plant in Canada.  Backlog grew 27 percent over the same period last year to $1.4 billion.
