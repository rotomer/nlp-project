NEW AWARDS OF $5.8 BILLION, RECORD BACKLOG OF $25.7 BILLION
IRVING, TEXAS  August 7, 2007  Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2007.  Net earnings rose 44 percent to $96 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared with $67 million or $0.74 per diluted share for the same period last year.  Operating profit for the quarter was $187 million, compared with $162 million in the second quarter of 2006.  All business segments posted substantial growth in revenue and profit over last year, with the exception of Government which declined as expected.    Revenue grew by 22 percent to $4.2 billion, compared with $3.5 billion in the second quarter of 2006, mainly due to significant growth in the Oil & Gas and Power segments.
New project awards for the second quarter were $5.8 billion, equal to the record-setting quarter a year ago.  This quarter included a $1.7 billion award for the TXU Oak Grove coal-fired power units in Texas.  Consolidated backlog rose to another new company record of $25.7 billion, up 43 percent from a year ago and up 8 percent sequentially over the prior quarter.
 
Corporate G&A expense for the quarter was $52 million, compared with $54 million in the second quarter of 2006. Strong cash flows drove cash and cash equivalents to $1.5 billion, up from $1.1 billion last quarter and $585 million a year ago.
"Fluor continues to capitalize on the market for major new energy and infrastructure capital programs globally, as evidenced by the robustness of our new awards and backlog," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alan Boeckmann. "Strong operating performance and substantial market opportunity continues to reinforce our confidence in the business outlook."
Outlook
All business segments delivered operating results that exceeded our expectations for the second quarter. New awards continue to be very strong, including major awards in the oil, gas, petrochemicals, power and mining markets. We are very encouraged by the overall strength of financial results to date and, as a result, we are increasing our full year guidance for Earnings Per Share to a range of $4.00 to $4.20 per share for 2007. Our previous guidance for 2007 was a range of $3.50 to $3.80 per share.
Business Segments
Fluor's Oil & Gas segment reported second quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, up 65 percent from the second quarter of 2006. Operating profit grew to $101 million, up 31 percent over 2006. Results reflect continued strength in world energy markets and the associated increase in new project awards over the last two years. Operating margin was 4.7 percent, down from 5.9 percent a year ago, as a number of large projects transition from engineering to the construction
 
 
phase which typically generates lower margin percentages. New oil, gas and petrochemical awards in the second quarter totaled $2.1 billion, including a large poly-silicon plant and refinery expansion work in the United States and a refinery project in Europe. Ending backlog at June 30, 2007 for Oil & Gas rose to $14.0 billion, a 68 percent increase from a year ago.
Fluor's Industrial & Infrastructure segment reported revenue of $877 million, up 17 percent over last year. Operating profit was $23 million, a 27 percent increase over the second quarter of 2006. Strong performance across the segment, especially in mining, drove both revenue and operating profit higher. Operating margins were 2.6 percent, up from 2.4 percent a year ago. New awards of $1.1 billion for the quarter included a significant mining project in Australia. Backlog rose to $5.7 billion, up 6 percent from $5.4 billion a year ago.
As anticipated, revenue for the Government segment declined to $325 million for the second quarter, compared with $816 million a year ago. Operating profit was $9 million, down from $25 million a year ago, and operating margin was 2.9 percent compared with 3.0 percent last year. The second quarter of 2006 benefited from contributions from hurricane relief work for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Iraq reconstruction work and the Fernald project. Second quarter new awards totaled $181 million, and ending backlog was $428 million.
The Global Services segment reported revenue of $598 million, up 24 percent from $483 million in the second quarter of last year. Revenue increases continue to be driven primarily by growth in operations and maintenance (O&M) activity. Operating profit grew by 21 percent to
 
 
$48 million, reflecting strong growth from both the O&M and equipment services business lines. Operating margin was 8.1 percent, level with last year. New awards were $570 million including a major multi-year contract renewal, which brought backlog to $2.6 billion at the end of the second quarter.
Fluor's Power segment reported revenue of $280 million, up 164 percent from $106 million in the second quarter of 2006. Operating profit was $6 million in the second quarter, compared with $3 million a year ago. Operating margin was 2.3 percent. Power segment new awards were $1.8 billion, reflecting the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of two 800 megawatt coal-fired power units for TXU. Ending backlog for the quarter rose to $3.0 billion, more than double the $1.4 billion at the end of last quarter.
Results for the Six Months
Net earnings for the first six months of 2007 were $180 million, or $1.99 per diluted share. This compares with $155 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2006. Revenue rose 11 percent to $7.9 billion, compared with $7.1 billion in the first half of last year.
