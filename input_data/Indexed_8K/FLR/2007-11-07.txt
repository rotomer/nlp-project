IRVING, TEXAS  November 7, 2007  Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2007.  Revenue grew by 22 percent to $4.1 billion, compared with $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2006.  Net earnings in the third quarter were $94 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, reflecting solid profit contributions from Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure, Global Services and Power.  This compares with $27 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the same period last year.  Operating profit for the quarter was $190 million, compared with $47 million in the third quarter of 2006.   Net earnings and operating profit for the third quarter of 2006 included the impact of loss provisions of $168 million on several fixed price projects.
 
New project awards for the third quarter were a record-setting $6.0 billion, including a significant award for work on a new refinery in the Middle East.  Consolidated backlog also rose to a company record of $27.9 billion, a $2.2 billion sequential increase over last quarter and up 41 percent from the same period a year ago.
 
 
                Corporate G&A expense for the quarter was $45 million, compared with $33 million in the third quarter of 2006.  Compensation cost included in G&A increased in the 2007 period as a result of strong operating performance and an increase in the company's stock price.  Cash and cash equivalents were $1.6 billion, up from $1.5 billion last quarter and $895 million a year ago.
 
                "Fluor is delivering strong results and growth in 2007, and we expect these positive trends to continue throughout 2008," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alan Boeckmann. "We posted the best new award quarter in the company's 95 year history, and with nearly $28 billion in backlog, 2008 is shaping up to be another very good year for Fluor."
                 
Outlook
Based on the strength of underlying performance to date, the company is narrowing its earnings guidance to a range of $4.10 to $4.20 per share for 2007.  Looking ahead to 2008, all segments have strong prospects and expect solid growth over 2007.  The company continues to be encouraged by the strength of new awards, and is actively working to grow Fluor's resource base to support the expanding backlog of work.  Considering these factors and the positive momentum in Fluor's key financial metrics, we are establishing initial 2008 earnings guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.30 per share.
 
Business Segments
                Fluor's Oil & Gas segment reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, up 58 percent from the third quarter of 2006.  Operating profit grew to $112 million, up 28 percent over 2006.
 
 
This strong performance reflects the significant growth in backlog over the last two years.  Operating margin was 5.1 percent, down from 6.3 percent a year ago, as a number of large projects are transitioning from engineering to the lower-margin construction phase.  New awards in the third quarter totaled $4.3 billion, including the engineering, procurement and construction of the utilities and offsites for a major new refinery complex in the Middle East.  Ending backlog for Oil & Gas at September 30, 2007 rose to $16.4 billion, up 63 percent from $10.1 billion a year ago and up 17 percent sequentially.
 
Fluor's Industrial & Infrastructure segment reported revenue of $735 million in the third quarter, down 8 percent from last year.  Operating profit in the third quarter of 2007 was $27 million.  This compares with $22 million in the third quarter of 2006, which included a $22 million charge on a fixed price road project.  Operating margins rose to 3.6 percent, up from 2.7 percent a year ago.  Margins in the segment continue to expand, reflecting improved performance across the segment.   New awards in the quarter were $364 million, and ending backlog was $5.2 billion compared with $5.3 billion a year ago.
 
                Revenue for the Government segment was $337 million for the third quarter, compared with $550 million a year ago when the segment recorded revenue contributions from hurricane relief work for FEMA.  The segment reported an operating loss of $2 million in the quarter, including a $21 million charge relating to the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.  This compares with an operating loss of $95 million a year ago, when provisions of $146 million were recorded on fixed price projects, including embassies and the Bagram project.  Third quarter new awards totaled $708 million,
 
 
including the final year of the existing Hanford contract.  Ending backlog was $839 million, compared with $928 million a year ago.
 
                The Global Services segment reported revenue of $542 million, up 12 percent from $484 million in the third quarter of last year.  Operating profit grew by 51 percent to $48 million, up from $32 million a year ago.  Operating margin increased to 8.8 percent, up from 6.5 percent a year ago.  Improvements in profits and margins reflect strong growth and performance from both the operations and maintenance and equipment services business lines.  New awards were $540 million, bringing backlog to $2.7 billion at the end of the third quarter.
 
                Fluor's Power segment reported revenue of $324 million, up 121 percent from $147 million in the third quarter of 2006.  Operating profit was $6 million in the third quarter, compared with $2 million a year ago.  Operating margin improved to 1.8 percent, from 1.4 percent last year.  Recent awards including new power generation and environmental betterment projects are driving the improved financial performance.  The Power segment booked new awards of $71 million in the third quarter, bringing ending backlog to $2.8 billion which compares with $1.1 billion in the same period of 2006.
 
Results for the Nine Months
                Net earnings for the first nine months of 2007 were $274 million, or $3.01 per diluted share.  This compares with $183 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2006.  Revenue rose 15 percent to $12.0 billion, compared with $10.4 billion in the first nine months of last year.
