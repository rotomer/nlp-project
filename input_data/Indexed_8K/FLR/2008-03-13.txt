The stock trading plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Fluor's policy regarding stock transactions.
 
Under the plan, Mr. Boeckmann may sell up to 20,000 shares per month beginning in April 2008 and ending in December 2008.  Upon completion of the planned sales under his Rule 10b5-1 Plan, Mr. Boeckmann will continue to significantly exceed the Company's stock ownership guidelines.
 
Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate officers and directors to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they do not have material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders can gradually diversify their investment portfolios and can spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce any market impact.
