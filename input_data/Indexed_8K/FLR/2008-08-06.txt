Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On August 1, 2008, the Board of Directors of Fluor Corporation approved amendments to Section 2.04, Section 2.07 and Section 3.02 of Fluor's amended and restated bylaws.  The amendments, which were effective immediately upon approval, implemented the changes described below.
 
1.
                                      
The amended bylaws clarify that stockholders seeking to nominate directors or propose other business at a meeting must comply with the advance notice provisions in Section 2.04.  The advance notice provisions in Section 2.04 will not apply to stockholders seeking to have a stockholder proposal considered for inclusion in Fluor's annual proxy statement only pursuant to and in compliance with the notice requirements applicable to stockholder proposals under the federal proxy rules.
 
2.
                                      
The amended bylaws update the information that must be included in a notice under Section 2.04.  Among other things, the amendments require a stockholder that intends to propose a nomination or other business to provide information about (a) any agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to the nomination or other business to be proposed and (b) any agreement, arrangement or understanding that has the effect or intent of mitigating loss, managing risk or benefiting from changes in the share price of any class of shares of Fluor, or increasing or decreasing voting power with respect to shares of Fluor, including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares.  In addition, the amended bylaws require that the stockholder provide Fluor with a written update of certain of the information required to be included in the notice within five business days after the record date for the meeting.
 
3.
                                      
The amended bylaws provide guidance in Section 2.04(C) regarding the persons that stockholders may designate to represent them at an annual or special meeting.  Previously, the bylaws did not include that guidance.
 
The amended bylaws provide in Section 3.02 for a range of directors from ten to fourteen.  Subsequent to the effectiveness of the amended bylaws, the Board fixed by resolution in accordance with the certificate of incorporation the exact number of directors at eleven.
4.
                                      
 
The advance notice deadlines in Section 2.04 remain as set forth in the 2008 Proxy Statement under the caption "ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  Advance Notice Procedures".
 
The preceding description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended and restated bylaws of Fluor, which are filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this report and are incorporated herein by reference.

If any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.04, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted.

Section 2.07
                               
Voting
.
 
(a)
                                 
Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question.  Each stockholder shall, at each meeting of the stockholders, be entitled to vote in person or by proxy each share or fractional share of the stock of the Corporation having voting rights on the matter in question and which shall have been held by him or her and registered in his or her name on the books of the Corporation:
 
(i)
                                         
on the date fixed pursuant to Section 6.05 of the Bylaws as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting, or
 
(ii)
                                      
if no such record date shall have been so fixed, then (a) at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of the meeting shall be given or (b) if notice of the meeting shall be waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which meeting shall be held.
 
(b)
                                
Shares of its own stock belonging to the corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the corporation or any subsidiary of the corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.  Persons holding stock of the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote such stock. Persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation such person has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or such person's proxy, may represent such stock and vote thereon.  Stock having voting power standing of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, shall be voted in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
(c)
                                 
Any such voting rights may be exercised by the stockholder entitled thereto in person or by his or her proxy or by his or her attorney thereunto authorized and delivered to the secretary of the meeting; provided, however, that no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date unless said proxy shall provide for a longer period.  The attendance at any meeting by a stockholder who may theretofore have given a proxy shall not have the effect of revoking the same unless he or she shall in writing so notify the secretary of the meeting prior to the voting of the proxy.  At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast; except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, directors (not exceeding the authorized number of directors as fixed by the Board in accordance with the certificate of incorporation) shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast if as of the record date for such meeting the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected based upon nominations then expected to be made by or at the direction of the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or to be brought before the meeting by a stockholder who has given notice thereof.  For purposes of this
Section 2.07(c), a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director nominee.  If, for any cause, the Board shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected thereafter at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws.  All other matters shall, unless otherwise provided by the certificate of incorporation, these by-laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the corporation which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.  The vote at any meeting of the stockholders on any question need not be by ballot, unless so directed by the chairman of the meeting.  On a vote by ballot each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his or her proxy, if there be such proxy, and it shall state the number of shares voted.
 
Section 2.08

Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, as required by applicable law.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
 
Section 2.09
                               
Inspectors of Election
.  The corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.  The corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act.  In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.  Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.  The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law.  In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law.  No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
