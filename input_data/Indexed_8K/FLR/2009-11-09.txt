2009 EPS GUIDANCE REVISED TO RANGE OF $3.75-$3.90
                 
2010 EPS GUIDANCE ESTABLISHED AT RANGE OF $3.20 - $3.60
 
IRVING, TEXAS  November 9, 2009  Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2009.  Revenue declined by 4 percent to $5.4 billion, compared with $5.7 billion in the third quarter of 2008, mainly driven by decreases in the Oil & Gas and Power segments.  Net earnings attributable to Fluor in the third quarter of 2009 were $162 million, a decrease of 11 percent from $182 million a year ago.  Earnings per diluted share was $0.89, compared with $1.00 per diluted share for the same period last year.  Segment profit for the quarter was $300 million, down 8 percent from $324 million a year ago.  While three of the five business segments reported earnings growth over 2008, the Oil & Gas segment profit declined by 8 percent and the Global Services segment profit was impacted by a $45 million provision relating to a collection issue on a completed paper mill revamp project.  Segment margins were 5.5 percent this quarter compared with 5.7 percent in the third quarter of 2008.
 
New project awards for the third quarter were $2.9 billion, compared with record awards of $8.8 billion a year ago.   Consolidated backlog at the end of the third quarter was $28.0 billion, which is a $2.9 billion decrease from last quarter and a 23 percent decrease from a year ago.
 
 
During the third quarter of 2009, the Company removed approximately $1.2 billion from backlog for a gas processing expansion project in Russia which has been delayed indefinitely by the client.  Including this delayed project, cancellations and scope reductions since the beginning of 2009 total approximately $5.3 billion.
 
Corporate G&A expense for the quarter was $50 million, up from $45 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Fluor's financial condition remains strong, with cash plus current and non-current marketable securities totaling $2.4 billion, up from $2.2 billion a year ago.
 
"Strong new awards in 2008 and the first half of 2009 have contributed to Fluor's $28 billion backlog, allowing us to maintain our selectivity and discipline when pursuing new prospects," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alan Boeckmann.  "Looking ahead to 2010, we are taking a cautious view of our markets at this time, but remain hopeful that a broader economic recovery will develop during the year."
 
Outlook
 
Due to the collection issue on the paper mill project, along with the impact of recent cancellations, scope reductions and delays, the company has trimmed its 2009 earnings guidance to a range of $3.75 to $3.90 per share.  For 2010, while the company is optimistic that the general economy and capital investment levels will recover, recent delays suggest that the outlook for many of our markets remains uncertain.  As a result, we are establishing initial 2010 earnings guidance in the range of $3.20 to $3.60 per share.
Business Segments
 
Fluor's Oil & Gas segment reported third quarter revenue of $2.9 billion, down 11 percent from the third quarter of 2008, while segment profit declined 8 percent to $189 million.  Declines in both revenue and segment profit reflect declining new award and backlog levels in recent quarters.  New awards in the third quarter totaled $1.2 billion, which compares with a record $5.1 billion a year ago.  Ending backlog for Oil & Gas at September 30, 2009 was $13.1 billion, down 43 percent from $22.8 billion a year ago.  Backlog reflects the impact of project cancellations, scope reductions and delays of approximately $5 billion during 2009, including a $1.2 billion gas processing project in Russia which was removed from backlog this quarter.
 
Fluor's Industrial & Infrastructure segment reported a 26 percent revenue increase to $1.1 billion, and segment profit rose 49 percent to $42 million, reflecting increases in both the infrastructure and mining and metals business lines.  Segment profit in the third quarter of 2008 included the impact of a $16 million provision relating to the London Connect infrastructure project.  During the third quarter of 2009, the company successfully resolved a dispute on the London Connect project relating to claims against the client for delays and additional costs.  The settlement allows for the final close-out of all outstanding issues, with no material impact to the segment's profit.   New awards in the quarter were $494 million, and ending backlog rose to $9.7 billion, up 14 percent from $8.5 billion a year ago.
 
Revenue for the Government segment rose by 47 percent to $544 million for the third quarter of 2009.  Segment profit for the quarter increased 34 percent to $24 million, compared to
$18 million a year ago.  Growth in results can primarily be attributed to contributions from the Savannah River project and LOGCAP IV task orders in Afghanistan.  Third quarter new awards totaled $872 million, compared with $922 million a year ago, including approximately $400 million for the annual booking of the Savannah River contract and approximately $160 million for LOGCAP IV task orders.  Ending backlog rose to $1.3 billion, up from $886 million a year ago.
 
The Global Services segment reported revenue of $529 million, down 11 percent from the third quarter of last year.  Segment profit was $0.5 million compared with $49 million a year ago, with the majority of the decline attributable to a $45 million provision for the collection issue on the completed paper mill revamp project in Louisiana.  New awards were $183 million, compared with $405 million last year, bringing backlog to $2.4 billion at the end of the third quarter which is down from $2.7 billion a year ago.
 
Fluor's Power segment reported revenue of $317 million, down 40 percent from the third quarter of 2008.  While the segment has continued to replenish backlog throughout the year, revenue declined as a large coal-fired project in Texas progressed closer to completion.  Due to substantial progress on backlog projects, segment profit in the third quarter increased to $45 million, up from $24 million a year ago.  The segment booked new awards of $152 million in the third quarter, bringing ending backlog to $1.5 billion which compares with $1.6 billion a year ago.
 
Results for the Nine Months
 
Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the first nine months of 2009 were $536 million, up from $527 million for the first nine months of 2008.  Earnings per diluted share for the nine months rose to $2.93, which compares with $2.86 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Results for 2008 included a pre-tax gain of $79 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, from the sale of a joint venture interest in the Greater Gabbard offshore wind power project.   Revenue for the first nine months of 2009 was up modestly to $16.5 billion, compared with $16.3 billion in the first nine months of last year.
