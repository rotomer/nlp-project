(c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned of record by such stockholder and the beneficial owner as of the date of the notice, and a representation that the stockholder will notify the Corporation in writing within five business days after the record date for such meeting of the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation owned of record by the stockholder and such beneficial owner as of the record date for the meeting (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (A)(3) of this Section 2.04), and (iii) a representation that the stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such nomination or business; and
 
(d) as to the stockholder giving the notice or, if the notice is given on behalf of a beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, as to such beneficial owner (i) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such stockholder or beneficial owner as of the date of the notice, and a representation that the stockholder will notify the Corporation in writing within five business days after the record date for such meeting of the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such stockholder or beneficial owner as of the record date for the meeting (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (A)(3) of this Section 2.04), (ii) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or other business between or among such stockholder or beneficial owner and any other person, including without limitation any agreements that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 5 or Item 6 of Exchange Act Schedule 13D (regardless of whether the requirement to file a Schedule 13D is applicable to the stockholder or beneficial owner) and a representation that the stockholder will notify the Corporation in writing within five business days after the record date for such meeting of any such agreement, arrangement, or understanding in effect as of the record date for the meeting (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (A)(3) of this Section 2.04), (iii) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholder's notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder or beneficial owner, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class of the Corporation's capital stock, or maintain, increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder or beneficial owner with respect to shares of stock of the Corporation, and a representation that the stockholder will notify the Corporation in writing within five business days after the record date for such meeting of any such agreement, arrangement or understanding in effect as of the record date for the meeting (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (A)(3) of this Section 2.04), and (iv) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner intends or is part of a group which intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to  approve or adopt the proposal and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such nomination or proposal; and
(e) any other information relating to the stockholder giving the notice that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with the solicitation of proxies pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
(3)           Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 2.04 to the contrary, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders is different from the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, a stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A) of this Section 2.04 shall set forth a representation that the stockholder will notify the Corporation in writing within five business days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, or by the opening of business on the date of the meeting (whichever is earlier), of the information required under clauses (A)(2)(c)(ii) and (A)(2)(d)(i)-(iii) of this Section 2.04, and such information shall be current as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.
 
(4)           This Section 2.04 shall not apply to a proposal or nomination proposed to be made by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present the proposal or nomination at an annual or special meeting only pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) or any other rule promulgated under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and such proposal or nominee has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such meeting.
 
(B)           .  Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.04 is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.04.  In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 2.04 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.  In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
Special Meetings of Stockholders

(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.04 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.04.  The Board of Directors or its designee shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any other business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.04 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (A)(2)(d)(iv) of this Section 2.04). If any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 2.04, then except as otherwise provided by law, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04, if the stockholder does not provide the information required under clauses (A)(2)(c)(ii) and (A)(2)(d)(i)-(iii) of this Section 2.04 to the Corporation within the times frames specified herein or if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.

Notice of Meetings
annual or special, shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting by delivering a notice thereof to him or her personally, or by depositing such notice in the United States mail, in a postage prepaid envelope, directed to him or her at his or her post office address furnished by him or her to the Secretary of the Corporation for such purpose or, if he or she shall not have furnished to the Secretary his or her address for such purposes, then at his or her post office address last known to the Secretary, or if otherwise consented to by suchstockholder, by transmitting a notice thereof to him or her by means of electronic transmission.  Except as otherwise expressly required by law, no publication of any notice of a meeting of the stockholders shall be required.  Every notice of a meeting of the stockholders shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special meeting, shall also state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.  Notice of any meeting of stockholders shall not be required to be given to any stockholder who shall have waived such notice and such notice shall be deemed waived by any stockholder who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy, except a stockholder who shall attend such meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Except as otherwise expressly required by law, notice of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders need not be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.
 
Section 2.06           .  Except in the case of any meeting for the election of directors summarily ordered as provided by law, the holders of record of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to be voted thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation or any adjournment thereof.  In the absence of a quorum at any meeting or any adjournment thereof, the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat or, in the absence therefrom of all the stockholders, any officer entitled to preside at, or to act as secretary of, such meeting may adjourn such meeting from time to time.  At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
Quorum
 
Section 2.07           .
Voting
 
(a)           Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question.  Each stockholder shall, at each meeting of the stockholders, be entitled to vote in person or by proxy each share or fractional share of the stock of the Corporation having voting rights on the matter in question and which shall have been held by him or her and registered in his or her name on the books of the Corporation on the date fixed pursuant to Section 6.05 of the Bylaws as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting.
(b)           Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.  Persons holding stock of the Corporation in a fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote such stock. Persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation such person has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or such person's proxy, may represent such stock and vote thereon.  Stock having voting power standing of record in the names of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, shall be voted in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
(c)           Any such voting rights may be exercised by the stockholder entitled thereto in person or by his or her proxy or by his or her attorney thereunto authorized and delivered to the secretary of the meeting; provided, however, that no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date unless said proxy shall provide for a longer period.  The attendance at any meeting by a stockholder who may theretofore have given a proxy shall not have the effect of revoking the same unless he or she shall in writing so notify the secretary of the meeting prior to the voting of the proxy.  At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast; except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, directors (not exceeding the authorized number of directors as fixed by the Board in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation) shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast if as of the record date for such meeting the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected based upon nominations then expected to be made by or at the direction of the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or to be brought before the meeting by a stockholder who has given notice thereof.  For purposes of this Section 2.07(c), a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director nominee.  If, for any cause, the Board shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected thereafter at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws.  All other matters shall, unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.  The vote at any meeting of the stockholders on any question need not be by ballot, unless so directed by the chairman of the meeting.  On a vote by ballot each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his or her proxy, if there be such proxy, and it shall state the number of shares voted.
 
Section 2.08           .  The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, however, that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the
List of Stockholders
stockholders entitled to vote as of the 10th day before the meeting date. Such list shall be arranged in alphabetical order and shall show the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, as required by applicable law.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
 
Section 2.09           .  The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.  The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act.  In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.  Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.  The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law.  In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law.  No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.

General and Special Bank Accounts
 
Section 6.01           .  The shares of stock of the Corporation may be issued in book-entry form or evidenced by certificates.  However, every owner of stock of the Corporation shall be entitled upon request to have a certificate or certificates, to be in such form as the Board shall prescribe, certifying the number and class of shares of the stock of the Corporation owned by him or her.

Any or all of the signatures on the certificates may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon any such certificate shall thereafter have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, such certificate may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as though the person who signed such certificate, or whose facsimile signature shall have been placed thereupon, were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.  A record shall be kept of the respective names of the persons, firms or corporations owning the stock represented by such certificates or held in book-entry form, the number and class of shares represented by such certificates or held in book-entry form, respectively, and the respective dates thereof, and in case of cancellation the respective dates of cancellation.  Every certificate surrendered to the Corporation for exchange or transfer shall be cancelled, and no new certificate or certificates shall be issued (or book entry made) in exchange for any existing certificate until such existing certificate shall have been so cancelled, except in cases provided for in Section 6.04 of the Bylaws.

The person in whose name shares of stock stand on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the Corporation.  Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, such fact shall be stated expressly in the entry of transfer if, when the certificate or certificates shall be presented to the Corporation for transfer, both the transferor and the transferee request the Corporation to do so.
Transfers of Stock
 
Section 6.03           .

Regulations
 
Section 6.04           .

Section 6.05           .

If the Board shall fix a record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of a meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. If, in any case involving the determination of stockholders for any purpose other than notice of or voting at a meeting of stockholders, the Board shall not fix such a record date, the record date for determining stockholders for such purpose shall be the close of business on the day on which the Board shall adopt the resolution relating thereto.  A determination of stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of such meeting;
Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record
 
provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

Waiver of Notices
 
Section 7.03           .  The fiscal year of the Corporation shall end on the 31st day of December of each year.
