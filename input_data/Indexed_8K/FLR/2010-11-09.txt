On November 4, 2010, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has approved an increase in the Company's share repurchase program of approximately 7.2 million shares, bringing the total number of shares available for repurchase to twelve million.  The current authorization is equal to 6.7% of the Company's shares outstanding at October 29, 2010. The shares will be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at the Company's discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors and at such times and in amounts that the Company deems appropriate.
On November 4, 2010, the Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share.  The release incorrectly states the record date for the dividend.  The correct record date is December 3, 2010 and not December 4, 2010 as previously reported.
