On December 1, 2010, Fluor Corporation (the "Company") adopted a revised Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") applicable to all employees, including the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and principal accounting officer and controller.  The Code was revised, among other things, to (1) enhance its overall readability and understanding, (2) update its design, tone and learning aids, and (3) address compliance with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the Company's operations, including its commitment to anti-corruption, avoidance of conflicts of interest and prevention of money laundering, among other matters.  The adoption of the revised Code did not result in any waiver, explicit or implicit, of any provision of the Company's previous Code.
 
The foregoing summary of the revised Code does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the revised Code, which is posted in the Sustainability section of the Company's website at www.fluor.com.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
