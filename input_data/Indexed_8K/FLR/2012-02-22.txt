Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On February 22, 2012, Fluor Corporation announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011.  A copy of the press release (the "") making this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Earnings Release
 
The Earnings Release contains a discussion of segment profit that would be deemed a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC rules.  "Segment profit" is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding: corporate general and administrative expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non-operating income and expense items. The Earnings Release includes a reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Fluor believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides information that is useful to its investors regarding its financial performance and results of operations.
 
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to liabilities of that section.  Furthermore, this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
Fluor Corporation includes backlog and new awards data in the Earnings Release.  Backlog is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress.  Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur.  Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, and deferrals, as appropriate.  New awards is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded in the period.  Backlog and new awards measures are regularly reported in the construction industry.

2011 NEW AWARDS OF $26.9 BILLION; BACKLOG OF $39.5 BILLION
                 
2011 EARNINGS OF $594 MILLION; EPS OF $3.40 PER DILUTED SHARE
                 
2012 EPS GUIDANCE AFFIRMED AT RANGE OF $3.40-$3.80 PER SHARE
 
IRVING, TEXAS  February 22, 2012  Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) today announced financial results for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.  Net earnings attributable to Fluor for 2011 were $594 million, or $3.40 per diluted share, compared with $357 million, or $1.98 per diluted share in 2010.  Consolidated segment profit for the year was $1.0 billion, compared with $621 million in 2010 which was impacted by significant pre-tax charges on two infrastructure projects.  Results in 2011 reflect a substantial increase in the profit contribution from the Industrial & Infrastructure (I&I) segment.  Consolidated revenue for the year totaled a record $23.4 billion, which was up 12 percent from $20.8 billion a year ago, mainly due to strong growth in the mining and metals business line within the I&I segment.
 
Full year new awards were strong at $26.9 billion, which compares with record bookings of $27.4 billion a year ago, reflecting substantial mining & metals orders in the I&I segment and sizable orders in Oil & Gas.  Consolidated backlog rose to a new year-end high of $39.5 billion, up 13 percent from a year ago.
 
"I am pleased that Fluor has delivered another year of strong new awards, resulting in double-digit backlog growth and earnings per share at the top end of our expectations for 2011," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Seaton.  "We continue to have a strong prospect list which supports our growth projection for 2012."
 
Corporate G&A expense for the year rose to $163 million, up from $156 million a year ago, mainly due to higher management incentive compensation which was partially offset by overhead cost reductions.  Fluor's financial condition remains very strong, with cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaling $2.8 billion, which is up from $2.6 billion a year ago.  During 2011, the Company generated $890 million in cash flow from operating activities, repurchased $640 million worth of Fluor shares, and paid out $88 million in dividends.  The Company also took advantage of attractive market rates and completed a $500 million offering of 10-year unsecured notes to enhance cash balances in the United States.
 
Outlook
 
Despite continuing economic uncertainty, the Company remains encouraged about future opportunities across its diverse end-markets, and is maintaining its EPS guidance for 2012 at the previously announced range of $3.40 to $3.80 per diluted share, which includes the estimated impact of ongoing operating expenses of approximately $0.20 per share associated with the Company's investment in NuScale Power.
Business Segments
 
Fluor's Oil & Gas unit reported segment profit of $276 million in 2011, down from $344 million in 2010 which included higher margin contribution from projects that were completed or nearing completion.  Revenue rose by 3 percent to $8.0 billion in 2011.  Full year new awards in 2011 totaled $8.3 billion, which compares with $9.7 billion in 2010.  In the fourth quarter, the segment booked a $1.5 billion award for the construction management of Syncrude Canada Ltd.'s Mildred Lake project in Alberta, Canada.  Ending Oil & Gas backlog rose 6 percent from a year ago to end 2011 at $15.1 billion.
 
The Industrial & Infrastructure group reported segment profit of $389 million, reflecting strong profits from the mining & metals and infrastructure business lines.  This compares with a segment loss of $170 million in 2010.  The Greater Gabbard Offshore Wind Farm project, which is nearing completion, has experienced a number of issues which substantially increased the estimated cost to complete the project.  On the Greater Gabbard project, results for 2011 included charges of $60 million, while 2010 was impacted by provisions totaling $343 million.  Results for 2010 were also impacted by a $95 million charge related to a bankruptcy court ruling on a completed road project.  Total revenue for the segment rose 41 percent to $9.7 billion in 2011, mainly due to increases in mining & metals project volume.  New awards remained strong at $12.2 billion, which compares with $12.5 billion last year.  Year-end backlog rose to a segment record $19.6 billion, representing a 16 percent increase over 2010.
 
Government posted segment profit of $145 million, which compares with $142 million reported a year ago.  Revenue in 2011 grew by 12 percent to $3.4 billion.  Improved results
primarily reflect higher levels of project execution activities on LOGCAP IV task orders in Afghanistan.   New awards totaled $3.7 billion for the year, up 35 percent from $2.8 billion in 2010, reflecting initial funding of the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion project and increased funding of LOGCAP IV task orders.  Ending backlog rose to $1.1 billion, compared with $751 million a year ago.
 
Segment profit for Global Services rose 14 percent to $152 million in 2011, compared with $133 million in 2010.  Revenue increased by 5 percent to $1.6 billion.  Improved financial results were primarily due to growth in the equipment business line.  Full year new awards of $1.0 billion were down from $1.6 billion a year ago, reflecting a reduced volume of operations and maintenance activities.  Ending backlog declined to $1.9 billion from $2.1 billion a year ago.
 
Fluor's Power group reported segment profit of $81 million, down from $171 million last year, on a 56 percent decline in revenue to $743 million.  Lower segment results primarily reflect the completion or near-completion of several large projects and relatively low new award volume in 2010.  With a strong second half, 2011 new awards rose to $1.6 billion, a substantial improvement from $757 million in 2010.  The fourth quarter included an award from the Lower Colorado River Authority to build a 540-megawatt gas-fired combined-cycle power plant in Texas.   Power segment backlog rose to $1.8 billion from $972 million a year ago, reflecting the recent increase in new awards.
Fourth Quarter Results
 
Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $153 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, compared with $117 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in 2010.  Fourth quarter segment profit totaled $279 million, compared with $77 million a year ago which included pre-tax charges of $180 million on the Greater Gabbard Offshore Wind Farm project and $28 million on a gas-fired power plant in Georgia.  Fluor's tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2011, at 26 percent, was lower than expected due to the favorable resolution of various tax issues and audits.  Fluor's consolidated tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $152 million benefit from the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary, largely arising from the financial impact of the Greater Gabbard losses on the affected subsidiary.  Corporate G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $61 million, which compares with $58 million reported a year ago.  Revenue for the quarter of $6.3 billion was 19 percent higher than last year, mainly due to a significant increase in Industrial & Infrastructure.  Fourth quarter new awards were $4.3 billion, including awards of $2.5 billion in Oil & Gas, $947 million in Power and $504 million in I&I.
