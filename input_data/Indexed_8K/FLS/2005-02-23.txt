Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On February 16, 2005, the board of directors (the "Board") of Flowserve Corporation (the "Company") finalized the establishment of performance criteria applicable to the Company's Long-Term Incentive Cash Plan (the "Long-Term Incentive Cash Plan") and Annual Incentive Plan (the "Annual Incentive Plan") for cash bonuses that certain salaried employees of the Company, including its executive officers, are eligible to earn. Any bonuses under the Long-Term Incentive Cash Plan will be earned during 2005 through 2007, to be paid out in 2008. Any bonuses under the Annual Incentive Plan will be earned during 2005, to be paid out in 2006.
Under the Long-Term Incentive Cash Plan, the performance measure is the average return on invested capital over a three-year performance period. The return on invested capital target will be set at the beginning of each three-year performance period based on benchmark data. Actual amounts payable under the Long-Term Incentive Cash Plan can range from 0% to 200% of the target amounts, based upon the extent to which performance under the foregoing criteria meets, exceeds, or is below the target.
Under the Annual Incentive Plan, the primary performance measures are operating income and cash flow in addition to certain local performance criteria. Actual amounts payable under the Annual Incentive Plan can range from 0% to 200% of the target amounts, based upon the extent to which performance under the foregoing criteria meets, exceeds, or is below the target.
 
      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
Date: February 23, 2005
