(b) ISSUANCE FEE. 0.125%, per annum, on the Available Amount, payable to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Issuing Lender) quarterly in arrears from the date of issuance of the Letter of Credit, commencing on the Closing Date, and continuing on the last business day of each June, September, December and March thereafter through and including the Credit Expiration Date; and any accrued but unpaid fee as of such Credit Expiration Date shall be due and payable on the Credit Expiration Date (the "ISSUANCE FEE"). (c) OTHER FEES. Such other fees for the administration and fronting of the Letter of Credit as shall be agreed to between the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender in any letter agreements entered into in connection herewith, such fees to be solely for the account of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender, as applicable. 3.3 COMPUTATION OF RATES AND FEES. All computations of interest and fees payable hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). 3.4 ADDITIONAL COSTS. Amounts sufficient to compensate the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and each Lender for any additional actual costs resulting from the introduction of or change in any Law, guideline or request or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the administration of such Law or guideline which directly or indirectly: (a) imposes or modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by Issuing Lender or the participation obligation of the Lenders; (b) increases the amount of capital required or funded against letters of credit issued by Issuing Lender or the participation obligation of the Lenders (except to the extent such increase arises as a result of the individual creditworthiness of the Issuing Lender or a Lender); or (c) imposes on the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or a Lender some other banking or monetary requirements affecting the cost of issuing the Letter of Credit under this Agreement, and the result of any event referred to in CLAUSES (a), (b), or (c) above shall be to increase the cost to Issuing Lender of issuing or maintaining the Letter of Credit, or to increase the cost to any Lender of maintaining its participation arrangement in this transaction, payable on demand. Promptly after the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or an affected Lender becomes aware of any such introduction, change or requirement, the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, shall notify the Company thereof; provided that the delay or failure to promptly provide such notice shall not affect the Administrative Agent's, Issuing Lender's or affected Lender's rights under this SECTION 3.4; provided further that the Company shall not be required to compensate the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender, or other Lender, as the case may be, pursuant to this SECTION 3.4 for any increased cost incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such affected Lender notifies the Company of the event giving rise to such increased cost and of its intention to claim compensation therefor; and provided further that, if the event giving rise to such increased cost is retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. A certificate in reasonable detail as to such increased cost, which states the basis of calculation thereof, submitted by the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or an affected Lender to the Company shall be sufficient for the purpose of making any 22 LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
such claim. Such certificate shall certify that such costs are generally being charged by the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or an affected Lender to other similarly situated companies in connection with the issuance and maintenance of, or agreements to issue, similar letters of credit. Such increase in cost shall, with respect to Issuing Lender, be based upon a reasonable allocation of Issuing Lender's aggregate cost related to the Letter of Credit and, with respect to the affected Lender, be based upon actual cost incurred. In the event that any Lender shall claim payment of any increased costs pursuant to this SECTION 3.4, the Company shall have the option, to be exercised in writing, to (a) compensate such Lender for the specified additional costs on the basis, if any, negotiated between such Lender and the Company, or (b) replace such Lender with another commercial bank or other financial institution; provided that such replacement commercial bank or other financial institution shall: (i) be an Eligible Assignee; (ii) unconditionally offer in writing (with a copy to the Administrative Agent ) to purchase all of such Lender's rights and assume all of such Lender's obligations hereunder and under this Agreement without recourse at the principal amount of such Lender's participation plus interest and fees accrued thereon to the date of such purchase on a date therein specified; (iii) pay in full the obligations of the Company owing to the Lender being replaced (other than the requested increased costs) to such Lender concurrently with such replacement; (iv) execute an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, pursuant to which it becomes a party to this Agreement with a participation commitment equal to that of the Lender being replaced; and (v) upon such execution of such documents referred to in CLAUSE (IV) above and the payment by the Company of all of the requested costs accruing to the date of purchase, the replacement commercial bank or other financial institution shall constitute a "LENDER" hereunder with a participation commitment as so specified and the Lender being so replaced shall no longer constitute a Lender hereunder; provided that: (A) if a Lender accepts such an offer and such commercial bank or financial institution fails to purchase such rights, interests, and obligations on such specified date in accordance with the terms of such offer, the Company shall continue to be obligated to pay the increased costs to such Lender pursuant to this SECTION 3.4, and (B) if such Lender fails to accept such purchase offer, the Company shall not be obligated to pay to such Lender such increased costs from and after the date of such purchase offer. 3.5 EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The Company shall promptly pay after request therefor: (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses paid (or incurred, to the extent such costs are presented by the Administrative Agent to the Company for direct payment) by the Administrative Agent in connection with the syndication of this Agreement, (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses paid (or incurred, to the extent such costs are presented by the Administrative Agent to the Company for direct payment) by the Administrative Agent and Issuing Lender in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Papers and any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are consummated), and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including all reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements, and other charges of external counsel; (iii) all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender, and each of the Lenders incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any Rights under this Agreement or the other Loan Papers (including all such costs and expenses incurred during any "workout" or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any legal proceeding, including any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements, and other charges of external counsel; and (iv) all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred by the Administrative Agent as a result of and during the continuance of an Event of 23 LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
Default. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of the Letter of Credit Commitment and repayment of all the other Obligations. (B) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE COMPANY HEREBY AGREES TO INDEMNIFY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ISSUING LENDER, AND THE LENDERS, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES AND REPRESENTATIVES (EACH AN "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") AND HOLD EACH OF THEM HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, COSTS OR EXPENSES WHICH MAY ARISE OR BE ASSERTED AGAINST ANY OF THEM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THE LOAN PAPERS, THE LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENT, THE USE OR CONTEMPLATED USE OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT, OR ANY OTHER MATTER RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY SUCH CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, COSTS OR EXPENSES CAUSED BY, ARISING FROM OR EXISTING SOLELY BY REASON OF: (I) SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY'S WILLFUL BREACH OF ANY OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE LETTER OF CREDIT, OR (II) SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. IN THE EVENT ISSUING LENDER IS RESTRAINED OR ENJOINED BY ACTION OF THE COMPANY FROM PAYMENT TO THE BENEFICIARY UNDER THE LETTER OF CREDIT PURSUANT TO ANY JUDICIAL, GOVERNMENTAL OR QUASI-GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDING, THE COMPANY AGREES TO: (A) REIMBURSE EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR ALL COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES REASONABLY INCURRED BY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH (1) SUCH PROCEEDING, AND (2) ANY ACTIONS OR CLAIMS OF THE BENEFICIARY AGAINST SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY RESULTING FROM OR NOTWITHSTANDING SUCH RESTRAINT OR INJUNCTION, AND (B) EXTEND THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT IS THIRTY (30) DAYS BEYOND THAT PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT IS EXTENDED BY VIRTUE OF SUCH RESTRAINT OR INJUNCTION. NO INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN PAPER OR ARISING OUT OF ITS ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH. THE AGREEMENTS IN THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENT AND REPAYMENT OF ALL THE OTHER OBLIGATIONS. 3.6 TAXES. (a) Amounts sufficient such that any and all payments by the Company hereunder shall be made, in accordance with SECTION 3.7 hereof, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, excluding, in the case of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and each Lender, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the Laws of which the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and each Lender, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of the Administrative Agent's, Issuing Lender's or such Lender's applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). If the Company shall be required by Law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or any Lender, (A) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this SECTION 3.6) the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no 24 LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
such deductions been made, (B) the Company shall make such deductions, and (C) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Law. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by Law, to deduct or withhold income or other similar taxes imposed by the United States of America from interest, fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or any Lender other than the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or a Lender (i) which is a domestic corporation (as such term is defined in Section 7701 of the Code) for Federal income tax purposes or (ii) which has the Prescribed Forms on file with the Company for the applicable year to the extent the deduction or withholding of such taxes is not required as a result of the filing of such Prescribed Forms; provided that, if the Company shall so deduct or withhold any such taxes, it shall provide a statement to the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender setting forth the amount of such taxes so deducted or withheld, the applicable rate and any other information or documentation which the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender may reasonably request for assisting the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender to obtain any allowable credits or deductions for the taxes so deducted or withheld in the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender is subject to tax. (c) In addition, the Company agrees to pay any stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES"). (d) The Company agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this SECTION 3.6) paid by the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto except as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender. This indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. (e) Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment of Taxes by or at the direction of the Company, the Company will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in SECTION 11.3 hereof, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. Should the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or any Lender, within five (5) years of the termination of this Agreement, receive any refund, credit or deduction from any taxing authority to which the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender would not be entitled but for the payment by the Company of Taxes as required by this SECTION 3.6 (it being understood that the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender shall use reasonable efforts, as determined in its sole judgment, to claim and to pursue such refund, credits or deduction), the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender thereupon shall repay to the Company an amount with respect to such refund, credit or deduction equal to any net reduction in taxes actually obtained by the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender (as the case may be) and determined by the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender (as the case may be) to be attributable to such refund credit or deduction, provided that the Company upon the request of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount 25 LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
paid over to the Company (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant taxing authority) to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender is required to repay such amount attributable to such refund, credit or deduction to such taxing authority. The Company shall reimburse the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and each Lender for any reasonable costs incurred by the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender with the written consent of or at the written direction of the Company in determining the specific amount of any such refund, credit or deduction due to the Company pursuant to this SECTION 3.6(e). In no event shall the Company be obligated pursuant to the preceding sentence to make a payment to the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or a Lender for associated costs exceeding the amount payable to the Company by the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender in connection with any refund, credit or deduction, without the prior written consent of the Company. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Company or any other Person. (f) The Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and each Lender shall endeavor in good faith efforts (consistent with its internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to select a jurisdiction for its lending office or change the jurisdiction for its lending office, as the case may be, so as to avoid the imposition of any Taxes or Other Taxes or to eliminate the amount of any such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue; provided that no such selection or change of the jurisdiction for its lending office shall be made if, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or such Lender (as the case may be), such selection or change would be materially disadvantageous to it. In the event that any Lender shall claim payment of any additional amounts pursuant to this SECTION 3.6, such Lender shall, if the Company shall find a commercial bank or other financial institution which, if it is not a Lender, shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender, unconditionally offers in writing (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) to purchase all of such Lender's rights and assume all of such Lender's obligations hereunder without recourse at the principal amount of such Lender's participation hereunder plus interest, fees and other payments accrued thereon to the date of such purchase on a date therein specified, accept such purchase offer and the Company shall be obligated to pay the additional amounts to such Lender pursuant to this SECTION 3.6 to the date of such purchase; provided that (i) if the Lender accepts such an offer and such bank or financial institution fails to purchase such rights and assume such obligations on such specified date in accordance with the terms of such offer, the Company shall continue to be obligated to pay the additional amount to such Lender pursuant to this SECTION 3.6, or (ii) if such Lender fails to accept such purchase offer, the Company shall not be obligated to pay to such Lender such additional amounts from and after the date of such purchase offer. (g) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Company hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Company contained in this SECTION 3.6 shall survive the payment in full of the Obligation. 3.7 FORM AND CURRENCY OF PAYMENTS. (a) All payments (i) under SECTION 3.1 hereof for reimbursement of any Drawings, (ii) under SECTION 3.2(a) of the Applicable Letter of Credit Fee, and (iii) under SECTION 3.2(b) of the Issuance Fee, shall be payable in Dollars and with respect to CLAUSE (i) above, shall be payable for the full amount of such Drawing (plus any accrued interest on any unpaid reimbursement obligation). All payments of the administrative fee to the Administrative Agent shall be payable in Dollars. The payment of any and all other fees, commissions, interest, and expenses (except as 26 LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
set forth in this SECTION 3.7(a)) under this Agreement shall be made in the currency advanced or incurred, as the case may be. All payments under this Agreement shall be made in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent's office at 1301 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10019, or at such other office as the Administrative Agent shall specify in writing. (b) All payments made or required to be made by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in the currency advanced or incurred, as the case may be, without reduction, setoff, or counterclaim whatsoever; provided, however, that in the event that the Company is prevented by a Governmental Authority from making such payment in the currency borrowed, the Company shall forthwith give notice of such circumstance to the Administrative Agent. The Company, the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender, and the Lenders shall attempt to make an alternative arrangement for such payments; provided that, in the event that the Lenders, Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent, and the Company cannot agree on an alternative arrangement, all such payments shall be made in the Dollar Equivalent Amount of such obligation. 3.8 ACCELERATION OF UNDRAWN AMOUNTS. Should a Cash Collateral Call Event occur with respect to the Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent, by written notice to the Company, may, and at the direction of the Determining Lenders, shall demand that the Company pay to the Administrative Agent (for the Pro Rata benefit of the Lenders) for deposit in a segregated Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the Available Amount under the Letter of Credit (the "CASH COLLATERAL"), as security for the Obligation related to the Letter of Credit under SECTION 3.1 hereof, whereupon such amount shall forthwith be due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Company. The Cash Collateral Account shall be assigned to the Administrative Agent (for the Pro Rata benefit of the Lenders) pursuant to the Assignment of Cash Collateral Account which shall be executed and delivered by the Company concurrently with the deposit of the Cash Collateral in the Cash Collateral Account. Furthermore, the Company shall promptly execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, such other security agreements, pledge agreements, assignments, financing statements and amendments and modifications thereto in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require from time to time for the purpose of granting to, or maintaining or perfecting in favor of the Administrative Agent perfected Liens in the Cash Collateral and the Cash Collateral Account, together with other assurances of the enforceability, perfection and priority of the Administrative Agent's Liens as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require to avoid material impairment of the Liens granted or purported to be granted pursuant to this SECTION 3.8. The Cash Collateral held in the Cash Collateral Account may be invested and reinvested from time to time in Permitted Investments as the Company shall determine, which Permitted Investments shall be held in the name of the Administrative Agent (for the Pro Rata benefit of the Lenders), for the benefit of the Company. The tax identification number used in connection with each such Permitted Investment shall be that of the Company. Cash Collateral paid into or held in the Cash Collateral Account with respect to the Letter of Credit (including any Permitted Investments acquired or invested in with such Cash Collateral or allocable to the Letter of Credit), which are in excess of the sum of (a) the then Available Amount of the Letter of Credit plus (b) the amount of the Obligation then outstanding under SECTION 3.1 with respect to the Letter of Credit, may at the option of the Company either: (i) be released to the Company upon request, or (ii) remain or be deposited in the Cash Collateral Account. Appropriate measures shall be taken in order to provide the Administrative Agent with a perfected first priority security interest with respect to each Permitted Investment purchased with the Cash Collateral. Upon a Drawing under the Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to liquidate any Permitted Investment acquired or invested in with Cash Collateral paid into the Cash Collateral Account with respect to the Letter of Credit and deposit the proceeds therefrom in the Cash Collateral Account, 27 LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
and apply such proceeds and other sums paid into the Cash Collateral Account with respect to the Letter of Credit to the Obligation under SECTION 3.1 related to the Letter of Credit, retain such amounts as security for such Obligation or exercise such of the other rights and remedies as may be provided in this Agreement. In addition to releases to the Company of Cash Collateral and Permitted Investments pursuant to the preceding paragraph: (a) upon the full and final payment of the Obligation of the Company to the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and the Lenders under this Agreement, termination of the Letter of Credit Commitment, and cancellation of the Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent will release its Liens in the Cash Collateral Account and any Permitted Investments and return any remaining Cash Collateral and Permitted Investments to the Company, and (b) if a Cash Collateral Call Event ceases to be continuing with respect to the Letter of Credit, all Cash Collateral paid into or held in the Cash Collateral Account with respect to the Letter of Credit (and any Permitted Investments invested in or acquired with such Cash Collateral or allocable to the Letter of Credit) shall be released by the Administrative Agent to the Company upon request of the Company. 3.9 MAXIMUM RATE. Regardless of any provision contained in any Loan Paper, no Lender shall ever be entitled to contract for, charge, take, reserve, receive, or apply, as interest on the Obligation, or any part thereof, any amount in excess of the Maximum Rate, and, if a Lender ever does so, then such excess shall be deemed a partial prepayment of principal and treated hereunder as such and any remaining excess shall be refunded to the Company. In determining if the interest paid or payable exceeds the Maximum Rate, the Company and Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Law: (a) treat all loans or advances as but a single extension of credit (and Lenders and the Company agree that such is the case and that any provision herein for multiple loans or advances is for convenience only), (b) characterize any nonprincipal payment otherwise payable under the Loan Papers as an expense, fee or premium, rather than as interest, (c) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (d) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligation; provided that, if the Obligation is paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term thereof, and if the interest received for the actual period of existence thereof exceeds the Maximum Amount, Lenders shall refund such excess, and, in such event, Lenders shall not, to the extent permitted by Law, be subject to any penalties provided by any Laws for contracting for, charging, taking, reserving or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Amount. SECTION 4 GUARANTY 4.1 GUARANTY OF PAYMENT. Subject to the limitation set forth below, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally, jointly and severally guarantees to each Lender, Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent the prompt payment of the Obligation in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) and the timely performance of all other obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Papers. This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection and is a continuing guaranty and shall apply to the entire Obligation whenever arising. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Papers, to the extent the obligations of any Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal Law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under applicable Law (whether federal or state or otherwise and including, without limitation, Debtor Relief Laws). In particular, the aggregate liability of Flowserve S.A. resulting from the Guaranty or other obligations of Flowserve S.A. in connection with this Agreement or any other documents (if any) supplemental to this Agreement shall be limited to the aggregate free capital of Flowserve S.A. at any given point n time, i.e. limited to the aggregate amount of retained earnings and reserves of Flowserve S.A. to the extent they can be paid out as dividends according to 28 LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
Article 675 of the Swiss Code of Obligations (see also Articles 660 et seq. and 671 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations). 4.2 OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Loan Papers or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor. Each Guarantor agrees that this Guaranty may be enforced by the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or the Lenders without the necessity at any time of resorting to or exhausting any other security or collateral and without the necessity at any time of having recourse to the Loan Papers or any collateral, if any, hereafter securing the Obligation or otherwise and each Guarantor hereby waives the right to require the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or the Lenders to make demand on or proceed against the Company or any other Person (including any other Guarantor) or to require the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or Lenders to pursue any other remedy or enforce any other right. Each Guarantor further agrees that it shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Company or any other Guarantor of the Obligation for amounts paid under this Guaranty until such time as the Obligation has been indefeasibly paid in full in cash, the Letter of Credit Commitment under this Agreement has been terminated and no Person or Governmental Authority shall have any right to request any return or reimbursement of funds from the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or the Lenders in connection with monies received under this Agreement or the other Loan Papers. Each Guarantor further agrees that nothing contained herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or the Lenders from suing on the Loan Papers or foreclosing its or their, as applicable, security interest in or Lien on any collateral, if any, securing the Obligation or from exercising any other rights available to it or them, as applicable, under this Agreement or the other Loan Papers, or any other instrument of security, if any, and the exercise of any of the aforesaid rights and the completion of any foreclosure proceedings shall not constitute a discharge of any Guarantor's obligations hereunder; it being the purpose and intent of each Guarantor that, subject to such Guarantor's rights to raise defenses to payment that would be available to it if such Guarantor were named as the "Company" hereunder rather than as a Guarantor, its obligations hereunder shall be absolute, independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Neither any Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty nor any remedy for the enforcement thereof shall be impaired, modified, changed or released in any manner whatsoever by an impairment, modification, change, release, increase or limitation of the liability of the Company or any Guarantor or by reason of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company or any Guarantor. Each Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligation and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on this Guaranty or acceptance of this Guaranty. The Obligation, and any part of it, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon this Guaranty. All dealings between the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and the Lenders, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guaranty. Each Guarantor hereby subordinates to the Obligation all debts, liabilities and other obligations, now existing or hereafter created, whether direct, indirect, primary, secondary, several, joint and several or otherwise, and irrespective of whether such debts, liabilities and obligations be evidenced by note, contract, open account, book entry or otherwise, owing by the Company to such Guarantor. 4.3 MODIFICATIONS. Each Guarantor agrees that: (a) all or any part of the collateral now or hereafter held for the Obligation, if any, may be exchanged, compromised or surrendered from time to time; (b) none of the Lenders, Issuing Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall have any obligation to protect, perfect, secure or insure any such security interests, liens or encumbrances now or hereafter held, if any, for the Obligation; (c) the time or place of payment of the Obligation may be changed or extended, in whole or in part, to a time certain or otherwise, and may be renewed or accelerated, in whole or in part; 29 LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
(d) the Company and any other party liable for payment under the Loan Papers may be granted indulgences generally; (e) any of the provisions of the Loan Papers may be modified, amended or waived; (f) any party (including any other Guarantor) liable for the payment thereof may be granted indulgences or be released; and (g) any deposit balance for the credit of the Company or any other party liable for the payment of the Obligation or liable upon any security therefor may be released, in whole or in part, at, before or after the stated, extended or accelerated maturity of the Obligation, all without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor, which shall remain bound thereon, notwithstanding any such exchange, compromise, surrender, extension, renewal, acceleration, modification, indulgence or release. 4.4 Waiver OF RIGHTS. Each Guarantor expressly waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law: (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty by Issuing Lender and the Lenders and of all extensions of credit to the Company by Issuing Lender and the Lenders; (b) presentment and demand for payment or performance of any of the Obligation; (c) protest and notice of dishonor or of default (except as specifically required in this Agreement) with respect to the Obligation or with respect to any security therefor; (d) notice of the Lenders obtaining, amending, substituting for, releasing, waiving or modifying any security interest, Lien or encumbrance, if any, hereafter securing the Obligation, or the Lenders subordinating, compromising, discharging or releasing such security interests, Liens or encumbrances, if any; and (e) all other notices to which a Guarantor might otherwise be entitled. 4.5 REINSTATEMENT. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Papers, the obligations of each Guarantor under this SECTION 4 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligation is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligation, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and out of pocket expenses incurred by such Person in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Law. 4.6 REMEDIES. Each Guarantor agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender and the Lenders, on the other hand, the Obligation may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in SECTION 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in SECTION 9.2) notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing such Obligation from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or such Obligation being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such Obligation (whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors. 4.7 SUBROGATION. Each Guarantor agrees that, until the indefeasible payment of the Obligation in full in cash and the termination of the Letter of Credit Commitment, it will not exercise, and hereby waives, any right of reimbursement, subrogation, contribution, offset or other claims against the Company arising by contract or operation of law in connection with any payment made or required to be made by the Guarantors under this Agreement or the other Loan Papers.

expressly waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, other than such notice as is expressly required herein. SECTION 10 AGREEMENT AMONG LENDERS 10.1 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. (a) Each Lender hereby appoints Calyon New York Branch (and Calyon New York Branch, hereby accepts such appointment) as its nominee and agent, in its name and on its behalf: (i) to act as nominee for and on behalf of such Lender in and under all Loan Papers; (ii) to arrange the means whereby the funds of the Lenders are to be made available to or for the benefit of the Company under the Loan Papers; (iii) to take such action as may be requested by any Lender under the Loan Papers (when such Lender is entitled to make such request under the Loan Papers and after such requesting Lender has obtained the concurrence of such other Lenders as may be required under the Loan Papers); (iv) to receive all documents and items to be furnished to Lenders under the Loan Papers; (v) to be the secured party, mortgagee, beneficiary, and similar party in respect of, and to receive, as the case may be, any collateral for the benefit of Lenders; (vi) to timely distribute, and the Administrative Agent agrees to so distribute, to each Lender all material information, requests, documents, and items received from the Company under the Loan Papers; (vii) to promptly distribute to each Lender its ratable part of each payment or prepayment (whether voluntary, as proceeds of collateral upon or after foreclosure, as proceeds of insurance thereon, or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Loan Papers; (viii) to deliver to the appropriate Persons requests, demands, approvals, and consents received from the Lenders; and (ix) to execute, on behalf of the Lenders, such releases or other documents or instruments as are permitted by the Loan Papers or as directed by the Lenders or Determining Lenders (when entitled to so authorize) from time to time; provided, however, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to the Loan Papers or applicable Law. (b) The Administrative Agent may resign at any time as the Administrative Agent under the Loan Papers by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders. Should the initial or any successor Administrative Agent ever cease to be a party hereto or should the initial or any successor Administrative Agent ever resign as the Administrative Agent, then Determining Lenders shall elect the successor Administrative Agent from among the Lenders (other than the resigning Administrative Agent). If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by Determining Lenders, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank having a combined capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent under the Loan Papers by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the Rights of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations of Administrative Agent under the Loan Papers, and each Lender shall execute such documents as any Lender may reasonably request to reflect such change in and under the Loan Papers. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as the Administrative Agent under the Loan Papers, the provisions of this SECTION 10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent under the Loan Papers. (c) The Administrative Agent, in its capacity as a Lender, shall have the same Rights under the Loan Papers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT 52
acting as the Administrative Agent; the term "Lender" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent; and any resignation of the Administrative Agent hereunder shall not impair or otherwise affect any Rights which it has or may have in its capacity as an individual Lender. Each Lender and each Credit Party agrees that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary for the Lenders or for the Credit Parties but simply is acting in the capacity described herein to alleviate administrative burdens for both the Credit Parties and the Lenders, that the Administrative Agent has no duties or responsibilities to the Lenders or the Credit Parties except those expressly set forth herein, and that the Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender has all Rights of any other Lender. (d) The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may now or hereafter be engaged in one or more loan, letter of credit, leasing, or other financing transactions with the Credit Parties, act as trustee or depositary for the Credit Parties, or otherwise be engaged in other transactions with the Credit Parties (collectively, the "other activities") not the subject of the Loan Papers. Without limiting the Rights of the Lenders specifically set forth in the Loan Papers, the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates shall not be responsible to account to the Lenders for such other activities, and no Lender shall have any interest in any other activities, any present or future guaranties by or for the account of the Credit Parties which are not contemplated or included in the Loan Papers, any present or future offset exercised by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates in respect of such other activities, any present or future property taken as security for any such other activities, or any property now or hereafter in the possession or control of the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates which may be or become security for the obligations of the Credit Parties arising under the Loan Papers by reason of the general description of indebtedness secured or of property contained in any other agreements, documents or instruments related to any such other activities; provided that, if any payments in respect of such guaranties or such property or the proceeds thereof shall be applied to reduction of the obligations of the Credit Parties arising under the Loan Papers, then each Lender shall be entitled to share in such application ratably. 10.2 EXPENSES. Upon demand by the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall pay its Pro Rata Part of any reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, court costs, reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs of collection) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any of the Loan Papers if and to the extent the Administrative Agent does not receive reimbursement therefor from other sources within 60 days after incurred; provided that, each Lender shall be entitled to receive its Pro Rata Part of any reimbursement for such expenses, or part thereof, which the Administrative Agent subsequently receives from such other sources. 10.3 PROPORTIONATE ABSORPTION OF LOSSES. Except as otherwise provided in the Loan Papers, nothing in the Loan Papers shall be deemed to give any Lender any advantage over any other Lender insofar as the Obligation arising under the Loan Papers is concerned, or to relieve any Lender from absorbing its Pro Rata Part of any losses sustained with respect to the Obligation (except to the extent such losses result from unilateral actions or inactions of any Lender that are not made in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Papers). 10.4 DELEGATION OF DUTIES; RELIANCE. The Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties or exercise any of its Rights under the Loan Papers by or through its Representatives. The Administrative Agent and its Representatives shall: (a) be entitled to rely upon (and shall be protected in relying upon) any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telecopy, telegram, telex or teletype message, statement, order, or other documents or conversation believed by it or them to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or made by the proper Person and, with respect to legal matters, upon opinion of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent, (b) be entitled to deem and LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT 53
treat each Lender as the owner and holder of the Obligation owed to such Lender for all purposes until, subject to SECTION 11.12, written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been given to and received by the Administrative Agent (and any request, authorization, consent, or approval of any Lender shall be conclusive and binding on each subsequent holder, assignee, or transferee of the Obligation owed to such Lender or portion thereof until such notice is given and received), (c) not be deemed to have notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default unless a responsible officer of the Administrative Agent, who handles matters associated with the Loan Papers and transactions thereunder, has actual knowledge thereof or the Administrative Agent has been notified thereof by a Lender or the Company, and (d) be entitled to consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. 10.5 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. (a) Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Representatives shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under the Loan Papers in good faith and reasonably believed by it or them to be within the discretion or power conferred upon it or them by the Loan Papers or be responsible for the consequences of any error of judgment, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct; and neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Representatives has any fiduciary relationship with any Lender by virtue of the Loan Papers (provided that nothing herein shall negate the obligation of the Administrative Agent to account for funds received by it for the account of any Lender). (b) Unless indemnified to its satisfaction against loss, cost, liability, and expense, the Administrative Agent shall not be compelled to do any act under the Loan Papers or to take any action toward the execution or enforcement of the powers thereby created or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of the Loan Papers. If the Administrative Agent requests instructions from the Lenders or Determining Lenders, as the case may be, with respect to any act or action (including, but not limited to, any failure to act) in connection with any Loan Paper, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled (but shall not be required) to refrain (without incurring any liability to any Person by so refraining) from such act or action unless and until it has received such instructions. In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Representatives be required to take any action which it or they determine could incur for it or them criminal or onerous civil liability. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent's acting or refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions of Determining Lenders. (c) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible in any manner to any Lender or any Participant for, and each Lender represents and warrants that it has not relied upon the Administrative Agent in respect of, (i) the creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and the risks involved to such Lender, (ii) the effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness, validity, or the due execution of any Loan Paper, (iii) any representation, warranty, document, certificate, report, or statement made therein or furnished thereunder or in connection therewith, (iv) the existence, priority, or perfection of any Lien hereafter granted or purported to be granted under any Loan Paper, or (v) observation of or compliance with any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of any Loan Paper on the part of any of the Credit Parties. Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and its Representatives and hold them harmless from and against (but limited to such Lender's Pro Rata Part of) any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, reasonable expenses, and reasonable disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, asserted against, or incurred by them in LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT 54
any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Papers or any action taken or omitted by them under the Loan Papers, to the extent the Administrative Agent and its Representatives are not reimbursed for such amounts by the Credit Parties (provided that, neither the Administrative Agent nor its Representatives shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct). 10.6 DEFAULT; COLLATERAL. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Lenders agree to promptly confer in order that Determining Lenders or the Lenders, as the case may be, may agree upon a course of action for the enforcement of the Rights of Lenders; and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action (without incurring any liability to any Person for so refraining) unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from Determining Lenders. In actions with respect to any property of the Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent is acting for the ratable benefit of each Lender. Any and all agreements to subordinate (whether made heretofore or hereafter) other Indebtedness or obligations of the Company to the Obligation shall be construed as being for the ratable benefit of each Lender. If the Administrative Agent acquires any security for the Obligation upon or in lieu of foreclosure, the same shall be held for the Pro Rata benefit of all Lenders. 10.7 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. To the extent permitted by Law: (a) the Administrative Agent (acting in its agent capacity) shall not incur any liability to any other Lender or Participant except for acts or omissions resulting from its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, and (b) neither the Administrative Agent, any Lender, nor any Participant shall incur any liability to any other Person for any act or omission of any other Lender or Participant. 10.8 RELATIONSHIP OF LENDERS. Nothing herein shall be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture among the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. 10.9 BENEFITS OF AGREEMENT. Except for the representations and covenants in SECTION 10.1(c) in favor of the Credit Parties, none of the provisions of this SECTION 10 shall inure to the benefit of the Credit Parties or any other Person other than Lenders; consequently, neither the Credit Parties nor any other Person shall be entitled to rely upon, or to raise as a defense, in any manner whatsoever, the failure of the Administrative Agent or Lender to comply with such provisions. 10.10 OBLIGATION SEVERAL. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several, and each Lender hereunder shall not be responsible for the obligations of the other Lenders hereunder, nor will the failure of one Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder relieve the other Lenders from the performance of their respective obligations hereunder. SECTION 11 MISCELLANEOUS 11.1 HEADINGS. The headings, captions, and arrangements used in any of the Loan Papers are, unless specified otherwise, for convenience only and shall not be deemed to limit, amplify, or modify the terms of the Loan Papers, nor affect the meaning thereof. 11.2 NONBUSINESS DAYS. In any case where any payment or action is due under any Loan Paper on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment or action may be delayed until the next-succeeding Business Day, but interest and fees shall continue to accrue in respect of any payment to which it is applicable until such payment is in fact made.

11.3 COMMUNICATIONS. Unless specifically otherwise provided, whenever any Loan Paper requires or permits any consent, approval, notice, request, or demand from one party to another, such communication must be in writing (which may be by telex or telecopy) to be effective and shall be deemed to have been given: (a) if by telex, when transmitted to the telex number, if any, for such party, and the appropriate answer back is received, (b) if by telecopy, when transmitted to the telecopy number for such party (and all such communications sent by telecopy shall be confirmed promptly thereafter by personal delivery or mailing in accordance with the provisions of this section; provided that any requirement in this parenthetical shall not affect the date on which such telecopy shall be deemed to have been delivered), (c) if by certified (return receipt) or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received, and (d) if by hand or overnight courier service, shall be deemed to have been given when received. Until changed by notice pursuant hereto, the address (and telex and telecopy numbers, if any) for the Administrative Agent and each Lender is set forth on SCHEDULE 2.1, and for each Credit Party is the address set forth by such Credit Party's signature on the signature page of this Agreement. 11.4 FORM AND NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS. Each agreement, document, instrument, or other writing to be furnished under any provision of this Agreement must be in form and substance and in such number of counterparts as may be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel. 11.5 SURVIVAL. All covenants, agreements, undertakings, representations, and warranties made in any of the Loan Papers shall survive all closings under the Loan Papers and, except as otherwise indicated, shall not be affected by any investigation made by any party. All rights of, and provisions relating to, reimbursement and indemnification of the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender or any Lender shall survive termination of this Agreement and payment in full of the Obligation. 11.6 Governing Law. THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHALL GOVERN THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTIES TO THE LOAN PAPERS AND THE VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, ENFORCEMENT, AND INTERPRETATION OF THE LOAN PAPERS. 11.7 INVALID PROVISIONS. If any provision in any Loan Paper is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable; the appropriate Loan Paper shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had never comprised a part thereof; and the remaining provisions thereof shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by such provision or by its severance therefrom. The Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender, the Lenders, and the Credit Parties agree to negotiate, in good faith, the terms of a replacement provision as similar to the severed provision as may be possible and be legal, valid, and enforceable. 11.8 Entirety. THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE CREDIT PARTIES, LENDERS, ISSUING LENDER, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SHALL BE DETERMINED SOLELY FROM WRITTEN AGREEMENTS, DOCUMENTS, AND INSTRUMENTS, AND ANY PRIOR ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN SUCH PARTIES ARE SUPERSEDED BY AND MERGED INTO SUCH WRITINGS. THIS AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED IN WRITING FROM TIME TO TIME) AND THE OTHER WRITTEN LOAN PAPERS EXECUTED BY THE CREDIT PARTIES, ANY LENDER, ISSUING LENDER, OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (TOGETHER WITH ALL COMMITMENT LETTERS AND FEE LETTERS AS THEY RELATE TO THE PAYMENT OF FEES AFTER THE CLOSING DATE) REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CREDIT PARTIES, LENDERS, ISSUING LENDER, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS BY SUCH PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN SUCH PARTIES. LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT 56

The scope of each of the foregoing waivers is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction, including, without limitation, contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims, and all other common law and statutory claims. The Credit Parties and each other party to this Agreement acknowledge that this waiver is a material inducement to the agreement of each party hereto to enter into a business relationship, that each has already relied on this waiver in entering into this agreement, and each will continue to rely on each of such waivers in related future dealings.

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, (i) this Agreement may only be amended, modified or waived by an instrument in writing executed jointly by the Company and Determining Lenders, and, in the case of any matter affecting the Administrative Agent, by the Administrative Agent, and may only be supplemented by documents delivered or to be delivered in accordance with the express terms hereof, and (ii) the other Loan Papers may only be the subject of an amendment, modification, or waiver if the Company and Determining Lenders, and, in the case of any matter affecting the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent, have approved same.

This Agreement may be executed in a number of identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original for all purposes and all of which constitute, collectively, one agreement; but, in making proof of this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one such counterpart. It is not necessary that each Lender execute the same counterpart so long as identical counterparts are executed by the Credit Parties, each Lender, and the Administrative Agent. This Agreement shall become effective when counterparts hereof shall have been executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent by each Lender, the Administrative Agent, and each Credit Party, or, when the Administrative Agent shall have received telecopied, telexed, or other evidence satisfactory to it that such party has executed and is delivering to the Administrative Agent a counterpart hereof. 11.12 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Company, the Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender, and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of the Loan Papers. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

Subject to the following, each Lender shall be entitled to obtain (on behalf of its Participants) the benefits of SECTION 3.4 with respect to all participations in its part of the Obligation outstanding from time to time so long as the Company shall not be obligated to pay any amount in excess of the amount that would be due to such Lender under SECTION 3.4 calculated as though no participations have been made. No Lender shall sell any participating interest under which the Participant shall have any Rights to approve any amendment, modification, or waiver of any Loan Paper, except to the extent such Lender has voting rights pursuant to SECTION 11.10; provided that, in those cases where a Participant is entitled to the benefits of SECTION 3.4 or a Lender grants Rights to its Participants to approve amendments to or waivers of the Loan Papers respecting the matters previously described in this sentence, such Lender must include a voting mechanism in the relevant participation agreement or agreements, as the case may be, whereby a majority of such Lender's portion of the Obligation (whether held by such Lender or Participant) shall control the vote for all of such Lender's portion of the Obligation.

If at any time any payment of the principal, interest, fees, or any other amount payable by any Credit Party under any Loan Paper is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of such Credit Party or otherwise, the obligations of such Credit Party under the Loan Papers with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though such payment had been due but not made at such time.

In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to any Credit Party or any other obligor, any such notice being waived by such Credit Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of such Credit Party, or any of them, against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Paper and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify such Credit Party and Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 11.16 CONFIDENTIALITY.
