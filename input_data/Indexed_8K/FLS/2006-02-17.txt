Flowserve's Bookings Increase 21 Percent In Fourth Quarter 2005; Reports Record Bookings For Full Year 2005; Repays Debt And Effectively Reduces Other Financing Obligations By $78 Million In 2005
DALLAS(BUSINESS WIRE)Feb. 13, 2006Flowserve Corp. (NYSE:FLS) today reported significant increases in bookings and backlog for the fourth quarter of 2005. It also reported that it repaid outstanding debt and effectively reduced other financing obligations by about $78 million during 2005.
Fourth Quarter Bookings Up 21 Percent; Up 14 Percent For Full Year
Fourth quarter 2005 bookings increased about 21 percent, including negative currency effects of 4 percent, to approximately $796 million, compared with approximately $660 million in the same year-ago period. For full year 2005, bookings increased about 14 percent, including positive currency effects of less than 1 percent, to approximately $3.03 billion, a record, compared with approximately $2.66 billion in full year 2004. Bookings results for 2005 reflect the awarding of several large competitive orders that were received in late December.
Excluding acquisitions, discontinued operations and divestitures, fourth quarter and full year 2005 bookings increased approximately 23 percent and 15 percent, respectively, including currency effects, compared with the respective prior year periods.
Year-end 2005 backlog increased about 19 percent, including negative currency effects of 7 percent, to approximately $998 million, compared with approximately $836 million at year-end 2004.
Repays $70 Million Of Effective Debt In Fourth Quarter; $78 Million In Full Year
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the company repaid outstanding debt, including optional prepayments, and effectively reduced other financing obligations by approximately $70 million. In full-year 2005, the company repaid outstanding debt and effectively reduced other financing obligations by about $78 million, excluding currency effects. The fourth quarter and full-year 2005 repayment amounts reflect both direct debt reduction and the previously disclosed Oct. 31, 2005, termination of the company's accounts receivable securitization facility, which was effectively replaced with borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility to the extent required.
The company's 2005 repayments of effective debt were in addition to funding substantial optional pension contributions, special premiums and fees related to the successful $1 billion August refinancing, additional incentive compensation and substantial additional professional fees related to the restatement and associated compliance during 2005.
Positive Outlook
 
Exhibit 99.1
The company reaffirmed its positive outlook for the future, citing a number of positive factors:
"These many positive factors, combined with our broad offering of world-class flow control products, create a strong engine to drive our strategies, generate improving financial results and create new value for our shareholders," President and Chief Executive Officer Lewis M. Kling said. "While the high level of restatement and compliance costs, related professional fees and refinancing expenses have impacted our financial results in 2005, we expect that these costs should decrease going forward. I continue to be extremely optimistic about Flowserve's future."
