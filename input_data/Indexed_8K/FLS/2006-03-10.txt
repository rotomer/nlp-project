          WHEREAS, the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company believes that the granting of the Stock Option described herein to the Participant is consistent with the stated purposes for which the Plan was adopted; and

This Stock Option may be exercised in whole or in part and from time to time hereinafter. This Stock Option is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Therefore, the Participant will be required to satisfy the holding period requirements that apply with respect to the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Stock Option in order to be eligible for the beneficial tax treatment afforded such a grant. To the extent the requisite holding period requirements are not satisfied, this Stock Option shall be deemed a NonQualified Stock Option (as defined in Section 2.17 of the Plan).

          The Stock Option granted by this Agreement may only be exercisable during the term of the Option Period provided in Paragraph 3 hereof and, except as provided in Paragraph 7, only by the Participant during the Participant's lifetime. No Stock Option granted by this Agreement is transferable by the Participant other than by will or pursuant to applicable laws of descent and distribution. The Stock Option and any rights and privileges in connection therewith, cannot be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated by operation of law, or otherwise, and is not otherwise subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or similar process. In the event of such occurrence, this Agreement will automatically terminate and will thereafter be null and void.
          Except as provided below, in the event that the outstanding Common Stock of the Company is increased, decreased, or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities, or if additional, new or different shares or securities are distributed with respect to the Common Stock through merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other distribution with respect to such Common Stock, each remaining share of Common Stock subject to this Stock Option will be substituted utilizing the principles set forth in Section 424(a) of the Code.

The Committee has sole and complete discretion with respect to all matters reserved to it by the Plan and the decisions of the majority of the Committee with respect to the Plan and this Agreement shall be final and binding upon the Participant and the Company. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall control.
          This Agreement shall not be construed to confer upon the Participant any right to continued employment with the Company or a Subsidiary and shall not limit the right of the Company or
 
a Subsidiary (as applicable), in its sole discretion, to terminate the employment of the Participant at any time.
          No Participant and no beneficiary or other person claiming under or through such Participant shall have any right, title or interest in any shares of Common Stock allocated or reserved under the Plan or subject to this Stock Option, except as to such shares of Common Stock, if any, that have been issued or transferred to such Participant.
          The Participant shall have no obligation to exercise any Stock Option granted by this Agreement.
