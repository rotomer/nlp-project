Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On April 27, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Flowserve Corporation (the "Company") approved a recommendation from its Organization and Compensation Committee and its Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to adjust planned non-employee director compensation effective May 1, 2006 as follows: (a) annual cash retainer of $50,000; (b) equity compensation with a target value of $100,000; (c) cash committee retainer of $5,000 and (d) cash committee chairman retainer of $10,000. The equity portion is provided in the form of restricted common stock having a $100,000 fair market valuation (under the Company's 2004 Stock Compensation Plan's formula) at each of the Company's annual meeting of shareholders, which is the date of grant.
     The adjustment to director compensation was the first since January 1, 2004. The Board approved this adjustment upon the recommendation of its independent compensation consultant following its review of a non-employee director compensation survey indicating that the adjustment was appropriate to maintain the competitiveness of this compensation. The Board's practice has been to review and, if deemed appropriate, adjust the non-employee director compensation about every two to three years.
