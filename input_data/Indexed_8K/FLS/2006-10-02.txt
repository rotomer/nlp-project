FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
DALLAS  Sept. 29, 2006  Flowserve Corp. (NYSE: FLS) today filed its Form 10-Q reports for the first and second quarters of 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is now current in filing its financial reports with the commission. The company announced financial results for these 2006 periods and year-to-date, including significantly improved bookings, gross margin and operating income.
(All comparisons in this news release are first six months of 2006 versus the same period of 2005, unless otherwise noted.)
Announcement Highlights:
 
2006 Form 10-Qs Filed
Flowserve filed its first and second quarter 2006 Form 10-Q quarterly reports with the SEC and is now current with its financial report filings with the commission. "We are delighted to return to current filer status," said Flowserve President and Chief Executive Officer Lewis M. Kling. "We have taken many steps to improve our financial reporting processes. In addition, our global financial organization is well positioned to continue to support our operations in taking advantage of our exciting current business opportunities."
Outlook
"I am very proud that we attained these significantly improved financial results while working hard to become a current SEC filer," Kling said. "We are encouraged by the success to date of our operational excellence initiatives, our strong operating performance, and our ability to take advantage of extremely robust markets, which we expect to continue. Today's stock repurchase announcement further underscores our positive view and confidence in our company and our businesses."

FIRST HALF 2006 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Organic bookings, which excludes currency in the 2006 periods and discontinued operations in 2005, increased 32 percent. Reported bookings were $1.8 billion, a 25 percent increase, including negative currency effects of approximately $36 million. These increases in bookings reflect strong growth in both aftermarket business and project-related business. First and second quarter 2006 reported bookings increased 23 percent and 26 percent compared with their respective prior year periods on an absolute basis, which includes discontinued operations that were divested on Dec. 31, 2005.
Ending backlog for the first half of 2006 was a record $1.4 billion, a 41 percent increase, including currency benefits of approximately $55 million, compared with year-end 2005. The increase in backlog was primarily driven by strong pump business and reflects the number and size of major project orders and longer customer requested lead times typical of robust markets.
First half 2006 sales were $1.4 billion, an 8 percent increase, including negative currency effects of approximately $19 million. This increase reflects strong growth in both project-related and aftermarket business. For the first and second quarters of 2006, sales increased 6 percent and 9 percent compared with their respective prior year periods.
3
 
Gross profit increased 13 percent to $466.1 million. Gross profit margin improved 140 basis points to 33.1 percent. These increases primarily reflect the increased sales, which favorably affects the absorption of fixed costs, cost savings resulting from the company's operational excellence and ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, improved pricing discipline and a greater volume of higher margin aftermarket business. For the first and second quarters of 2006, gross profit increased 12 percent and 13 percent compared with their respective prior year periods.
"We are extremely pleased by the significant improvements in our bookings, sales and gross profit margin, and particularly the flow-through from sales," Kling said. "This again confirms that our operational excellence programs are continuing to gain momentum as we simultaneously benefit from the robust market conditions. It is important to note that given this very strong customer market environment, Flowserve was still able to improve its overall year-to-date on-time delivery performance despite an environment increasingly characterized by occasional availability constraints with subcontractors and suppliers. Bottom line, our operational excellence initiatives are gaining traction and making a difference in our business."
First half 2006 selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percentage of sales declined 10 basis points to 25.3 percent. In the second quarter of 2006, SG&A as a percentage of sales declined 330 basis points to
4
 
23.8 percent, from 27.1 percent in the first quarter of this year, which includes costs in closing the company's 2004 and 2005 financial statements. SG&A for the first half of 2006 was $356.1 million, an increase of 7 percent, reflecting increased professional fees primarily related to the company's previously delayed financial reporting as well as stock option and other equity-based compensation expense.
"We understand the nature and sources of our corporate expenses and professional fees, and are starting to see the expected progress in reducing them," said Chief Financial Officer Mark A. Blinn. "As we have said before, some costs and fees related to compliance and completion of the 2004 and 2005 audits have reduced our financial results for the first half of 2006. We continue to anticipate that 2007 will be more representative of our true run rate for such expenses."
Operating margin improved to 7.8 percent, an increase of 150 basis points. Second quarter 2006 operating margin improved 390 basis points to 9.6 percent, from 5.7 percent in the first quarter of this year. Operating income increased 34 percent to $110.0 million. This improvement is mainly due to the previously discussed factors that increased gross profit, partially offset by the increases in SG&A. The increase includes negative currency effects of approximately $2 million.
5
 
Interest expense for the first half of 2006 declined $8.0 million, or 20 percent, to $31.9 million, reflecting the benefits of the company's $1 billion August 2005 refinancing.
Net income more than tripled to $47.0 million, or 81 cents a diluted share, from $13.9 million, or 25 cents a diluted share, reflecting the improvements in gross profit and operating income, reduction in interest expense, and the increase in other income, primarily due to unrealized gains on forward exchange contracts versus losses in the prior year period. First quarter 2006 net income increased to $13.9 million, or 24 cents a diluted share, from a net loss of $4.0 million, or 7 cents a diluted share, in the prior year period. Second quarter 2006 net income increased 84 percent to $33.1 million, or 57 cents a diluted share, compared with $18.0 million, or 32 cents a diluted share, in the prior year period.
The company continued to generate solid cash flow in the first half of 2006 and used a portion of it to repay $15.9 million of outstanding debt during the first half of the year. As a result, the company's net debt-to-capital ratio improved to 39.6 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2006.
The company also said that Moody's Investor Service recently upgraded the company's bank debt rating to Ba2, from Ba3. "We are encouraged by Moody's decision to upgrade our debt rating," Blinn said.
6
 
The company made no material contributions to its U.S. pension plan during the first half of 2006. "In September, we contributed approximately $36 million to our U.S. plan," Blinn said. "In addition to the stock repurchase program of up to 2 million shares that we are announcing today, we will continue to review a variety of additional options for using our expected cash flow in future periods, including possible dividends, increased capital expenditures and other strategic opportunities."
