Flowserve Reports Sharply Increased Bookings, Revenue and Net Income for Third Quarter of 2006
DALLAS(BUSINESS WIRE)Nov. 9, 2006Flowserve Corporation (NYSE:FLS) today filed its Form 10-Q report for the third quarter of 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and announced significantly improved quarterly financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. Announcement Highlights:
Third Quarter (comparisons to prior year quarter)
Year-to-Date (comparisons to prior year-to-date)
Outlook
"I am pleased with our continued double digit growth in bookings and our backlog conversion to sales in the quarter," said President and Chief Executive Officer Lewis Kling. "Our significant shift to original equipment project business in the quarter should create more profitable aftermarket opportunities for us in the future. Continued robust markets and our focus on improving our performance through operational excellence initiatives and supply chain management position us well for continued improvement. In fact, we expect continued momentum in our sales growth and improved gross profit efficiency in the fourth quarter."
 
Third Quarter 2006 Consolidated Results
(All comparisons in this news release are third quarter 2006 versus the same period of 2005, unless otherwise noted.)
Bookings from continuing operations increased 15 percent to $892 million. Reported bookings of $892 million for third quarter 2006 increased by $97.8 million, or 12 percent. This increase includes currency benefits of approximately $20 million. Reported bookings in 2005 include $20 million of bookings related to the General Services Group, a discontinued operation that was divested effective December 31, 2005. The 2006 increases are primarily attributable to the strong oil and gas industry demand, which is reflected by significant growth in both the Flowserve Pump and Flow Control divisions. This is the company's fifth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in consolidated Flowserve bookings.
Ending backlog for the third quarter of 2006 was $1.5 billion, a 56 percent increase, including an increase due to currency effects of approximately $56 million, compared with year-end 2005 and an 11 percent increase from second quarter 2006. The increase in backlog was primarily driven by strong pump business and reflects the number and size of major project orders and longer customer requested lead times typical of robust markets.
Third quarter 2006 sales of $771 million increased by $121.3 million, or 19 percent, including currency benefits of approximately $19 million. The increases are primarily attributable to the strength in the oil and gas market, particularly in the Middle East and North America and expansion into the Asia-Pacific region.
Gross profit increased 18 percent to $248 million. Gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points to 32.2 percent. The decrease primarily reflects a shift to a higher mix of large project business and, to a lesser extent, the timing of certain shipments and costs in the company's Pump division.
Third quarter 2006 selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points to 24.4 percent or $188 million. This increase includes negative currency effects of approximately $3 million, an increase in sales headcount and commissions related costs of $7 million, increases in non-cash stock-based compensation of $9 million, including a $5.6 million charge related to modifications to stock option plans, $3 million in travel due to increased selling and marketing activity and overall global growth, and various other costs.
Operating income for the quarter increased almost $6 million to $60 million, or 10 percent, as compared to 2005, including currency benefits of approximately $3 million. Operating margin decreased to 7.8 percent, a decrease of 60 basis points due to a higher mix of large project business and, to a lesser extent, the timing of certain shipments and costs, plus the increase in SG&A referenced above.
Despite higher prevailing interest rates, interest expense for the third quarter 2006 declined $2.6 million, or 14 percent, to $16.4 million, reflecting the benefits of the company's $1 billion August 2005 refinancing at lower rates. This 2005 refinancing also included a $28 million expense related to the extinguishment of prior debt obligations.
 
Net income from continuing operations increased to $27 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, from $5 million, or 8 cents per diluted share. This reflects a $6 million increase in operating income and the negative impact to prior year of $28 million refinancing expense equal to approximately 31 cents per share (net of tax). These increases are partially offset by increased taxes on the operating profit.
The company continued to generate solid cash flow in the third quarter and used a portion to fund its U.S. pension plan with an additional $36 million, including optional contributions in excess of government requirements. The company also added further investment in capital expenditures of $14 million during the third quarter.
"In addition to the stock repurchase program of up to two million shares that we previously announced, we will continue to review a variety of additional options for using our expected cash flow in future periods, including possible dividends, increased capital expenditures and other strategic investments," said Chief Financial Officer Mark Blinn. "We expect to begin the two million share repurchase program later this month."
