Item 4.01. Changes in Benefit Plan Certifying Accountant.
     On May 16, 2007, the Flowserve Corporation Retirement Savings Plan (the "Plan") dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Plan's independent registered public accounting firm and appointed Whitley Penn LLP ("Whitley Penn") for the Plan's fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.
     The change in accountants did not result from any dissatisfaction of Flowserve Corporation with the quality or delivery of professional services rendered by PwC. PwC continues to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Plan's sponsor, Flowserve Corporation (the "Company"), having been duly appointed by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Plan's decision to replace PwC with Whitley Penn as the Plan's independent registered public accounting firm was approved by the Audit Committee on May 16, 2007.
     The PwC reports on the Plan's financial statements as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.
     During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and through May 16, 2007, (i) there were no disagreements with PwC on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in their reports on the Plan's financial statements for such years, and (ii) there were no "reportable events" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
     The Plan and the Company have provided PwC a copy of the foregoing statements and requested a letter from PwC to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not PwC agrees with the above statements related to PwC. A copy of that letter, dated May 22, 2007, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
     During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and through May 16, 2007, neither the Plan, and the Company, as the Plan's sponsor, nor anyone acting on behalf of the Plan or the Company consulted Whitley Penn regarding any of the matters described in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
