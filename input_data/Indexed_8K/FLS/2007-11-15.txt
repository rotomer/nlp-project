Other Events.
     As previously reported, Flowserve Corporation (the "Company") is a defendant in a class action lawsuit filed in federal court in the Northern District of Texas (the "Court") alleging violations of federal securities laws. By order dated November 13, 2007, the Court has ruled in favor of the Company and denied the plaintiffs' motion to certify the case as a class action. It also granted defendants' summary judgment on claims brought against the Company and former officers under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and held other dispositive motions to be moot in light of the Court's rulings.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
