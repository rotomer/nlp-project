Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Effective September 12, 2008, Flowserve Corporation, a New York corporation (the Company), Flowserve B.V. and certain other foreign subsidiaries of the Company entered into a First Amendment to Letter of Credit Agreement (the Amendment) with ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as an issuing bank and the administrative agent, Calyon and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (collectively, the lenders), which renewed and modified certain terms of the Letter of Credit Agreement by and among the parties dated September 14, 2007 (the Agreement).
Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment, the lenders committed for an additional one-year period to issue letters of credit to the Company and its subsidiaries in an aggregate face amount not to exceed 150,000,000 at any time, and increased the total commitments under the Agreement from 80,000,000 to 110,000,000.
The Company will continue to pay certain fees for letters of credit written against the facility and fees for unused commitment that vary, in each case, based upon the Companys ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA. Under the terms of the Amendment, the two fee percentages increased by 0.50%  0.75% and 0.175%  0.225%, respectively; however, the foregoing fee percentages are each eligible for a 0.125% reduction on and after any date that the Company receives a Corporate Family Rating from Moodys of Ba1 and a Corporate Credit Rating from S&P of BB+. As of September 12, 2008 and giving effect to the Amendment, the letter of credit fee and unused commitment fee were 0.875% and 0.30%, respectively.
The Company will continue to guarantee any and all obligations and liabilities of its subsidiaries and itself under the terms of the Amendment for any issued letter of credit or related disbursement by a lender.

"Agreement"
"Amendment"
As such counsel, I have supervised the taking of the corporate and other business proceedings necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of, and have examined an executed original of, the Amendment. I have also examined and am familiar with the Amendment and the certified certificate of incorporation, bylaws, resolutions and certificates of good standing for the Guarantor.
I have also examined such other instruments and records and inquired into such other factual matters and matters of law as I deem necessary or pertinent to the formulation of the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to questions of fact relevant to the opinions stated herein, I have relied upon information obtained from other officers of the Guarantor and other sources believed by me to responsible, and, with your permission, I have assumed, without independent investigation, the accuracy of such information.
 
In rendering the opinions expressed below, I have examined originals, or copies of originals certified to my satisfaction, of such agreements, documents, certificates and other statements of government officials and corporate officers and such other papers and evidence as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for these opinions.
Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
1. The Guarantor is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of New York, and the Guarantor has full and adequate power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and is duly licensed or qualified and in good standing in each jurisdiction wherein the conduct of its business or the assets and properties owned or leased by it require such licensing or qualification.

3. The Amendment has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and has been executed and delivered by proper officers of the Guarantor and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Guarantor enforceable against it in accordance with its respective terms.
4. No order, authorization, consent, license, approval, permit of, or exemption of, or filing or registration with, any court or governmental department, agency, instrumentality or regulatory body, whether local, state or federal, is or will be required in connection with the lawful execution and delivery of the Amendment or the observance and performance by the Guarantor of any of the terms of the Agreement, as amended by the Amendment.
5. To the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, there is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation at law or in equity before or by any court or public body pending or threatened against or affecting the Guarantor or any of its assets and properties which, if adversely determined, could result in any material adverse change in the properties, business, operations or financial condition of the Guarantor.
 
Our opinions expressed above are limited to the laws of the States of Illinois and Texas, the general corporate laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America.
