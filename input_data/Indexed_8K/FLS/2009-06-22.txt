Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously reported, Flowserve Corporation (the "Company") is a defendant in a class action lawsuit that was filed in federal court in the Northern District of Texas (the "District Court") in August 2003 alleging violations of federal securities laws. As also previously reported, the plaintiffs in that lawsuit appealed the District Court's November 13, 2007 and January 4, 2008 rulings, which had denied the plaintiffs' motion to certify the case as a class action and had granted summary judgment in the Company's favor. On June 19, 2009 the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (the "Court of Appeals") issued an opinion vacating the District Court's denial of class certification, reversing in part and vacating in part the District Court's entry of summary judgment, and remanding the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the Court of Appeals' opinion. As a result of the Court of Appeals' opinion, the case will be returned to the District Court for further consideration of certain issues, including whether the plaintiffs can demonstrate that the case should be certified as a class action. The Company continues to believe that the lawsuit is without merit and that it has strong defenses to the case, and will continue to vigorously defend the case. Further description of the foregoing litigation as set forth in the Legal Proceedings section of the Company's previously filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2009 is incorporated herein by reference.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
