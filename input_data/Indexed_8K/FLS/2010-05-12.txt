Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On May 11, 2010, a federal judge in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas entered an order granting final approval of the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit originally filed against Flowserve Corporation, a New York corporation (the "Company"), and other defendants in 2003, which the Company has previously disclosed in its public filings. The District Court's order dismisses the lawsuit with prejudice and includes a full and final release of all claims of the class members against the Company and the other defendants. The order also acknowledges that the settlement does not constitute an admission of any wrongdoing or liability on the part of the Company or the other defendants.
     Under the previously disclosed terms of the settlement, the Company contributed $13.5 million to the $55 million total settlement amount. The Company's insurance carriers contributed $40 million to the settlement amount, with another defendant contributing the balance. The accrued reserve established by the Company for its contribution under the terms of the settlement was previously reported in the Company's financial results for 2009.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
