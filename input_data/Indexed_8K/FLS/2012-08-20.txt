Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 20, 2012 (the "Closing Date"), Flowserve Corporation, a New York corporation (the "Company"), entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as swingline lender, letter of credit issuer and administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (together, the "Lenders"), providing for term debt and a revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion, including a $400.0 million term loan facility with a maturity date of August 20, 2017 (the "Term Loan Facility") and a $850.0 million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of August 20, 2017 (the "Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the "Senior Credit Facility"). The Revolving Credit Facility will include a $300.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $30.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. Subject to certain conditions, the Company has the right to increase the amount of the Term Loan Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million.
On the Closing Date, approximately $400 million was advanced under the Term Loan Facility, and approximately $222 million was drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company used all of the proceeds advanced under the Term Loan Facility, along with approximately $217 million of proceeds advanced under the Revolving Credit Facility, to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the Company's then-existing Credit Agreement dated as of December 14, 2010, as amended, among the Company and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swingline lender and collateral agent, and the other lenders party thereto (the "Existing Credit Agreement"). In connection with this repayment, the Company's outstanding letters of credit under the Existing Credit Agreement were transferred to the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Company terminated the Existing Credit Agreement on the Closing Date. The proceeds of the Senior Credit Facility will be used to fund capital expenditures and other working capital needs of the Company. Future draws under the Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to various conditions, including the absence of defaults under the Credit Agreement.
The interest rates per annum applicable to the Senior Credit Facility (other than in respect of swingline loans) will be either LIBOR plus 1.125%, 1.250%, 1.500%, 1.750% or 2.000%, as applicable, depending on the Company's debt rating by either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, or, at the option of the Company, the Base Rate (to be defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) a daily rate equal to one month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%) plus 0.125%, 0.250%, 0.500%, 0.750% or 1.000%, as applicable, depending on the Company's debt rating by either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. As of the Closing Date, the initial interest rate on the Senior Credit Facility was LIBOR plus 1.50%. Beginning on the Closing Date, a commitment fee will be payable quarterly in arrears on the daily unused portions of the Senior Credit Facility. The commitment fee will be 0.150%, 0.175%, 0.225%, 0.275% or 0.350%, as applicable, of unused amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility depending on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio.
The Credit Agreement includes customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default, including maintenance of consolidated leverage ratios and interest coverage. Upon an event of default, the Lenders have the right to declare all outstanding loans immediately due and payable.
The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company. The Lenders have agreed to release such guarantees if the Company achieves a BBB (stable outlook) or better debt rating from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and a Baa2 (stable outlook) or better debt rating from Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties' rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.

If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender, shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice by the Borrower, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender
 
without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
3.03 .
Inability to Determine Rates
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) that the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and all Lenders. Thereafter, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended and (ii) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(iv) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

Capital Requirements
(c) . A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth, with supporting calculations in reasonable detail, the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurocurrency Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower;
(c) any failure by the Borrower to make a payment of any Loan or any drawing under a Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or

The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Base Rate used in determining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
DALLAS, August 20, 2012  Flowserve Corp. (NYSE:FLS), a leading provider of flow control products and services for the global infrastructure markets, today announced that it has completed a new $1.25 billion, five-year credit facility, which includes a $400 million term loan and a $850 million revolver that the company can increase, subject to certain conditions, by up to $250 million. The new facility was led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and replaces the company's existing facility that was scheduled to mature in December 2015.
The new $400 million term loan, which will bear an initial interest rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 150 basis points, replaces the existing $500 million term loan (which had approximately $463 million outstanding at refinancing) with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points at June 30, 2012. Also, the new $850 million revolver, having an initial interest rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points, replaces the existing $500 million revolver, which had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points at June 30, 2012. The company previously reported net debt of $622 million at June 30, 2012.
"We are pleased to announce the completion of a new credit facility as we work to execute our capital structure strategy," said Mike Taff, Flowserve senior vice president and chief financial officer. "This new facility provides us additional debt capacity to execute on our growth initiatives, while also enhancing our operating flexibility and reducing our borrowing costs after attaining investment grade status by all three rating agencies. With the support of this new facility, we continue to evaluate additional, cost-effective debt financing as we implement our stated long-term gross leverage ratio target of 1.0x-2.0x total debt to EBITDA and execute on our announced $1 billion share repurchase program."
