Exhibit 99.1
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Flowserve Corporation:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Flowserve Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule appearing under Item 15 of Part IV of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (not presented herein) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (not presented herein). Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010 AND FOR THE
THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011
We are principally engaged in the worldwide design, manufacture, distribution and service of industrial flow management equipment. We provide long lead-time, custom and other highly engineered pumps; standardized, general purpose pumps; mechanical seals; industrial valves; and related automation products and solutions primarily for oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management and other general industries requiring flow management products and services. Equipment manufactured and serviced by us is predominantly used in industries that deal with difficult-to-handle and corrosive fluids, as well as environments with extreme temperatures, pressure, horsepower and speed. Our business is affected by economic conditions in the United States ("U.S.") and other countries where our products are sold and serviced, by the cyclical nature and competitive environment of the oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management and other industries served, by the relationship of the U.S. dollar to other currencies and by the demand for and pricing of our customers end products.
European Sovereign Debt Crisis
At December 31, 2011, we had no direct investments in European sovereign or non-sovereign debt. However, certain of our defined benefit plans hold investments in European equity and fixed income securities as discussed in Note 12. Other than broad, macro-level economic impacts, we did not experience any direct or measurable disruptions in 2011 due to the European sovereign debt crisis.
We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of any future developments in the region on our current business, our customers and suppliers and the state of the global economy. Additional adverse developments could potentially impact our customers exposures to sovereign and non-sovereign European debt and could soften the level of capital investment and demand for our products and services.
Ongoing Events in North Africa, Middle East and Japan
 Ongoing political and economic conditions in North Africa have caused us to experience shipment delays to this region. We estimate that the shipments to this region that have been delayed resulted in lost or delayed opportunities for operating income of
$11.2 million
for
2011
. The preponderance of our physical assets in the region are located in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and have, to date, not been significantly affected by the unrest elsewhere in the region.
We continue to assess the conditions and potential adverse impacts of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in early 2011, in particular as they relate to our customers and suppliers in the impacted regions, as well as announced and potential regulatory impacts to the global nuclear power market. During
2011
, we did not experience any significant adverse impacts due to shipment delays, collection issues or supply chain disruptions. We are also closely monitoring the effects of the Japan crisis on the global nuclear power industry. While it is difficult to estimate the long-term effect of the Fukushima plant shutdown on the global nuclear power market, we have continued to ship nuclear orders in our backlog without significant disruption. We believe that there has been a related reduction in nuclear orders that could continue in the near term, though other parts of our overall power generation business could benefit as nuclear priorities are reevaluated.
Segment Reorganization
  As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, we reorganized our divisional operations by combining the former Flowserve Pump Division ("FPD") and former Flow Solutions Division ("FSD") into the Flow Solutions Group ("FSG"), effective January 1, 2010. FSG was divided into two reportable segments based on type of product and how we manage the business: FSG Engineered Product Division ("EPD") and FSG Industrial Product Division ("IPD"). EPD includes the longer lead-time, custom and other highly engineered pump product operations of the former FPD and substantially all of the operations of the former FSD. IPD consists of the more standardized, general purpose engineered pump product operations of the former FPD. Flow Control Division ("FCD") was not affected. We have retrospectively adjusted prior period financial information to reflect the current reporting structure.
Venezuela
  As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, effective January 11, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency (Bolivar) and moved to a two-tier exchange structure. The official exchange rate moved from
2.15
to
4.30
Bolivars to the U.S. dollar for non-essential items and to
2.60
Bolivars to the U.S. dollar for essential items. Additionally, effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated as hyperinflationary, and as a result, we began to use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency in Venezuela. On December 30, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced its intention to eliminate the favorable essential items rate effective January 1, 2011. Our operations in Venezuela generally consist of a service center that both imports equipment and parts from certain of our other locations for resale to third parties within Venezuela and performs service and repair activities. Our Venezuelan subsidiarys sales for the year ended
December 31, 2011
and total assets at
December 31, 2011
represented less than
1%
of our consolidated sales and total assets for the same period.

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
Although approvals by Venezuelas Commission for the Administration of Foreign Exchange have slowed, we have historically been able to remit dividends and other payments at the official rate, and we currently anticipate doing so in the future. Accordingly, we used the official rate of
4.30
Bolivars to the U.S. dollar for re-measurement of our Venezuelan financial statements into U.S. dollars for all periods presented.
As a result of the currency devaluation, we recognized a net loss of
$7.6
million in 2010. The loss was reported in
other income (expense)
, net in our consolidated statement of income and resulted in no tax benefit. The elimination of the favorable essential items rate, effective
January 1, 2011
, had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 ("Annual Report").
We have evaluated the carrying value of related assets and concluded that there is
no
current impairment. We are continuing to assess and monitor the ongoing impact of the currency devaluations on our Venezuelan operations and imports into the market, including our Venezuelan subsidiarys ability to remit cash for dividends and other payments at the official rate, as well as further actions of the Venezuelan government and economic conditions in Venezuela that may adversely impact our future consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Principles of Consolidation
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and our wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, we consolidate any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Noncontrolling interests of non-affiliated parties have been recognized for all majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries. Intercompany profits, transactions and balances among consolidated entities have been eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. Investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies, which represent noncontrolling ownership interests between
20%
and
50%
, are accounted for using the equity method, which approximates our equity interest in their underlying equivalent net book value under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). Investments in interests where we own less than
20%
of the investee are accounted for by the cost method, whereby income is only recognized in the event of dividend receipt. Investments accounted for by the cost method are tested annually for impairment. We recorded a
$3.1 million
gain in
2010
on the sale of an investment in a joint venture that was accounted for under the cost method.
Use of Estimates
  The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results may differ materially from such estimates. The most significant estimates and assumptions made by management are used in determining:
Revenue Recognition
 
Revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers, which is typically based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions. In addition, our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement, a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectability. We defer the recognition of revenue when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and/or services have been performed. Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Our contracts typically include cancellation provisions that require customers to reimburse us for costs incurred up to the date of cancellation, as well as any contractual cancellation penalties.
We enter into certain contracts with multiple deliverables that may include any combination of designing, developing, manufacturing, modifying, installing and commissioning of flow management equipment and providing services related to the performance of such products.
Delivery of these products and services typically occurs within a
one to two-year period
,
although many arrangements, such as "book and ship" type orders, have a shorter timeframe for delivery
.
We aggregate or separate deliverables into units of accounting based on whether the deliverable(s) have standalone value to the customer and when no general right of return exists. Contract value is allocated ratably to the units of accounting in the arrangement based on their relative selling prices determined as if the deliverables were sold separately.
Revenues for long-term contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and
8
FLOWSERVE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost-to-cost basis.
Percentage of completion revenue represents less than
9%
of our consolidated sales for
each year presented.
Revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered. Revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract. These contracts can range in duration, but generally extend for up to
five years
.
Fixed fee service contracts represent aproximately
1%
of consolidated sales for each year presented.
In certain instances, we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts. Failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non-recoverable costs. In instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable, we perform a project profitability analysis, accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues, which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project. In such instances, we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined. In circumstances where the total projected revenues still exceed total projected costs, the incurrence of unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
  We place temporary cash investments with financial institutions and, by policy, invest in those institutions and instruments that have minimal credit risk and market risk. These investments, with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, are classified as cash equivalents. They are highly liquid and principal values are not subject to significant risk of change due to interest rate fluctuations.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Risk
  The allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on estimates of the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable, which is determined principally based upon the aging of the accounts receivable, but also customer credit history, industry and market segment information, economic trends and conditions and credit reports. Customer credit issues, customer bankruptcies or general economic conditions may also impact our estimates.
Credit risks are mitigated by the diversity of our customer base across many different geographic regions and industries and by performing creditworthiness analyses on our customers. Additionally, we mitigate credit risk through letters of credit and advance payments received from our customers. As of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, we do not believe that we have any significant concentrations of credit risk.
Inventories and Related Reserves
  Inventories are stated at the lower-of-cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventories are based upon our assessment of market conditions for our products determined by historical usage and estimated future demand. Due to the long life cycles of our products, we carry spare parts inventories that have historically low usage rates and provide reserves for such inventory based on demonstrated usage and aging criteria.
Income Taxes, Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves
  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. We record valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of existing deferred tax assets, net operating losses and tax credits by jurisdiction and expectations of our ability to utilize these tax attributes through a review of past, current and estimated future taxable income and establishment of tax strategies.
We provide deferred taxes for the temporary differences associated with our investment in foreign subsidiaries that have a financial reporting basis that exceeds tax basis, unless we can assert permanent reinvestment in foreign jurisdictions. Financial reporting basis and tax basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries consist of both unremitted earnings and losses, as well as foreign currency translation adjustments.
The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes
9
FLOWSERVE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
While we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities. To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.
Legal and Environmental Accruals
  Legal and environmental reserves are recorded based upon a case-by-case analysis of the relevant facts and circumstances and an assessment of potential legal obligations and costs. Amounts relating to legal and environmental liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable. Assessments of legal and environmental costs are based on information obtained from our independent and in-house experts and our loss experience in similar situations. Estimates are updated as applicable when new information regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter becomes available. Legal fees associated with legal and environmental liabilities are expensed as incurred.
Estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos-related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed, settled and dismissed, with adjustments for events deemed unusual and unlikely to recur, and are included in retirement obligations and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. A substantial majority of our asbestos-related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities. Estimated indemnities and receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos-related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries, which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers. Estimated receivables are included in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. In one asbestos insurance related matter, we have a claim in litigation against relevant insurers substantially in excess of the recorded receivable. If our claim is resolved more favorably than reflected in this receivable, we would benefit from a one-time gain in the amount of such excess. We are currently unable to estimate the impact, if any, of unasserted asbestos-related claims, although future claims would also be subject to existing indemnities and insurance coverage.
Warranty Accruals
  Warranty obligations are based upon product failure rates, materials usage, service delivery costs, an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve such claims. The estimates of expected claims are generally a factor of historical claims and known product issues. Warranty obligations based on these factors are adjusted based on historical sales trends for the preceding
24 months
.
Insurance Accruals
  Insurance accruals are recorded for wholly or partially self-insured risks such as medical benefits and workers compensation and are based upon an analysis of our claim loss history, insurance deductibles, policy limits and other relevant factors and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The estimates are based upon information received from actuaries, insurance company adjusters, independent claims administrators or other independent sources. Changes in claims and differences between actual and expected claim losses could impact future accruals. Receivables from insurance carriers are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries, which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers. Estimated receivables are included in accounts receivable, net and other assets, net, as applicable, in our consolidated balance sheets.
Pension and Postretirement Obligations
  Determination of pension and postretirement benefits obligations is based on estimates made by management in consultation with independent actuaries and investment advisors. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and rates of compensation increase and other factors. Current market conditions, including changes in rates of return, interest rates and medical inflation rates, are considered in selecting these assumptions.
Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss as they arise and we amortize these costs into net pension expense over the remaining expected service period.
Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
  The value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is tested for impairment as of December 31 each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired.
In connection with our segment reorganization in 2010, we reallocated goodwill to our redefined reporting units and evaluated goodwill for impairment. The identification of our reporting units began at the operating segment level: EPD, IPD and FCD, and considered whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purpose of testing goodwill for impairment based on certain conditions. These conditions included, among other factors, (i) the extent to which a component represents a business and (ii) the aggregation of economically similar components within the operating segments and resulted in nine reporting units. Other factors that were considered in determining
10
FLOWSERVE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
whether the aggregation of components was appropriate included the similarity of the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the methods of distribution and the types of industries served.
Impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market participants. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. We did not record an impairment of goodwill in
2011
,
2010
or
2009
.
We also consider our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill. Although our market capitalization declined compared with
2010
, it did not decline to a level that indicated a potential impairment of our goodwill as of
December 31, 2011
.
Impairment losses for indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Fair values are calculated for trademarks using a "relief from royalty" method, which estimates the fair value of the trademarks by determining the present value of the royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark. This method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that have a significant impact on the fair value and are substantially consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above. We did not record a material impairment of our trademarks in
2011
,
2010
or
2009
.
The net realizable value of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, is reviewed periodically, when indicators of potential impairments are present, based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing a methodology similar to that for goodwill. Additional considerations related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
  Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. If asset retirement obligations exist, they are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the asset and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. The useful lives of leasehold improvements are the lesser of the remaining lease term or the useful life of the improvement. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are included in income from operations for the period. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. Generally, the estimated useful lives of the assets are:
Costs related to routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Internally Developed Software
  We capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal-use software. Generally, these costs are related to significant software development projects and are amortized over their estimated useful life, typically three to five years, upon implementation of the software.
Intangible Assets
  Intangible assets, excluding trademarks (which are considered to have an indefinite life), consist primarily of engineering drawings, distribution networks, existing customer relationships, software, patents and other items that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives generally ranging from
3
to
40
 years. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.
Deferred Loan Costs
  Deferred loan costs, consisting of fees and other expenses associated with debt financing, are amortized over the term of the associated debt using the effective interest method. Additional amortization is recorded in periods where optional prepayments on debt are made.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
  The carrying amounts of our financial instruments approximated fair value at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
11
FLOWSERVE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Hierarchical levels, as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities. An asset or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. Hierarchical levels are as follows:
Level I  Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level II  Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level I) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instruments anticipated life.
Level III  Inputs reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
  As part of our risk management strategy, we enter into derivative contracts to mitigate certain financial risks related to foreign currencies and interest rates. We have a risk-management and derivatives policy outlining the conditions under which we can enter into financial derivative transactions.
We employ a foreign currency economic hedging strategy to minimize potential losses in earnings or cash flows from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. This strategy also minimizes potential gains from favorable exchange rate movements. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions, denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency and from translation of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars. The primary currencies in which we operate, in addition to the U.S. dollar, are the Argentine peso, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Colombian peso, Euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona and Venezuelan bolivar. We enter into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging our exposure to floating interest rates on certain portions of our debt.
Our policy to achieve hedge accounting treatment requires us to document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, our risk management objective and strategy for entering into hedges and whether we intend to designate a formal hedge accounting relationship. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated in a formal hedge accounting relationship as fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges of (1) specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or (2) specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. In cases where we designate a hedge, we assess (both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Failure to demonstrate effectiveness in offsetting exposures retroactively or prospectively would cause us to deem the hedge ineffective.
All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or for which we have not elected to apply hedge accounting, which includes substantially all of our forward exchange contracts, the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in
other income (expense)
, net in the consolidated statements of income.
At the inception of a new derivative contract for which formal hedge accounting has been elected, our policy requires us to designate the derivative as a hedge of (a) a forecasted transaction or (b) the variability of cash flows that are to be received or paid in connection with a recognized asset or liability (a "cash flow" hedge). We have not historically entered into hedges of fair values. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, documented, designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in
other comprehensive (expense) income
, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. Upon settlement, realized gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income. Any hedge ineffectiveness (which represents the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the derivative do not mirror the change in the cash flow of the forecasted transaction) is recorded in current period earnings.
We discontinue hedge accounting when:
12
FLOWSERVE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
When hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we carry the derivative at its estimated fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value in current period earnings. If a cash flow hedge becomes ineffective, any deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the exposure relating to the item underlying the hedge is recognized. If it becomes probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately.
Foreign Currency Translation
  Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date, while income and expenses are translated at average rates for each month. Translation gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Transaction and translation gains and losses arising from intercompany balances are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss when the underlying transaction stems from a long-term equity investment or from debt designated as not due in the foreseeable future. Otherwise, we recognize transaction gains and losses arising from intercompany transactions as a component of income. Where intercompany balances are not long-term investment related or not designated as due beyond the foreseeable future, we may mitigate risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations by entering into forward exchange contracts. See Note 6 for further discussion of these forward exchange contracts.
Transactional currency gains and losses arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites functional currencies and changes in fair value of forward exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in our consolidated results of operations. For the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, we recognized net gains (losses) of
$3.7
 million,
$(26.5)
 million and
$(7.8)
 million, respectively, of such amounts in
other income (expense)
, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
Stock-Based Compensation
  Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant-date fair value. The exercise price of stock option awards and the value of restricted share, restricted share unit and performance-based unit awards (collectively referred to as "Restricted Shares") are set at the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, which is the date such grants are authorized by our Board of Directors. Restricted share units and performance-based units refer to restricted awards that do not have voting rights and accrue dividends, which are forfeited if vesting does not occur.
Options are expensed using the graded vesting model, whereby we recognize compensation cost over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We adjust share-based compensation at least annually for changes to the estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture experience. The intrinsic value of Restricted Shares, which is typically the product of share price at the date of grant and the number of Restricted Shares granted, is amortized on a straight-line basis to compensation expense over the periods in which the restrictions lapse based on the expected number of shares that will vest. The forfeiture rate is based on unvested Restricted Shares forfeited compared with original total Restricted Shares granted over a
4
-year period, excluding significant forfeiture events that are not expected to recur.
Earnings Per Share
  We use the two-class method of calculating Earnings Per Share ("EPS"). The "two-class" method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security as if all earnings for the period had been distributed. Unvested restricted share awards that earn non-forfeitable dividend rights qualify as participating securities and, accordingly, are included in the basic computation as such. Our unvested restricted shares participate on an equal basis with common shares; therefore, there is no difference in undistributed earnings allocated to each participating security. Accordingly, the presentation below is prepared on a combined basis and is presented as earnings per common share. The following is a reconciliation of net earnings of Flowserve Corporation and weighted average shares for calculating basic net earnings per common share.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
Earnings per weighted average common share outstanding was calculated as follows:
Diluted earnings per share above is based upon the weighted average number of shares as determined for basic earnings per share plus shares potentially issuable in conjunction with stock options and Restricted Shares.
For each of the three years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, we had
no
options to purchase common stock that were excluded from the computations of potentially dilutive securities.
Research and Development Expense
  Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred. Aggregate research and development costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") were
$35.0
 million,
$29.5
million and
$29.4
 million in
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively. Costs incurred for research and development primarily include salaries and benefits and consumable supplies, as well as rent, professional fees, utilities and the depreciation of property and equipment used in research and development activities.
Business Combinations
  All business combinations referred to in these financial statements used the purchase method of accounting, under which we allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, recognizing goodwill when the purchase price exceeds fair value of such identifiable assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed.
Accounting Developments
Pronouncements Implemented
In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2010-06, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements," which requires additional disclosures on transfers in and out of Level I and Level II and on activity for Level III fair value measurements. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures of Level III activity, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Our adoption of ASU No. 2010-06 had no material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
In September 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, "Revenue Recognition (ASC 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force," which addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit and requires expanded revenue recognition policy disclosures. This amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. Our adoption of ASU No. 2009-13, effective January 1, 2011, had no impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350): When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts - a consensus of the FASB

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
Emerging Issues Task Force," which modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. This amendment requires an entity to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists and to consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. Our adoption of ASU No. 2010-28, effective January 1, 2011, had no impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-29, "Business Combinations (ASC 805): Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force," which specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. This amendment also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under ASC 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. Our adoption of ASU No. 2010-29, effective January 1, 2011, had no material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income (ASC 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income," which specifies that an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This amendment also requires an entity to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 to defer the requirement to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income. ASU No. 2011-05 and 2011-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The adoption of ASU No. 2011-05 and 2011-12 will not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment," which specifies that an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU No. 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2011-08 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, "Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities," which requires enhanced disclosures about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset in accordance with either ASC 210-20-45, "Balance Sheet - Offsetting," or ASC 815-10-45, "Derivatives and Hedging - Overall," or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45. The adoption of ASU No. 2011-11 will not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Lawrence Pumps, Inc.

$89.6 million
, subject to final adjustments. LPI specializes in the design, development and manufacture of engineered centrifugal slurry pumps for critical services within the petroleum refining, petrochemical, pulp and paper and energy markets. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we deposited
$1.5 million
into escrow to be held and applied against any breach of representations, warranties or indemnities for
24 months
. Additionally, we have the right to make indemnification claims up to
15%

The purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair values at the date of acquisition and is summarized below:
The excess of the acquisition date fair value of the total purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the value expected to be obtained from the ability to be more competitive through the offering of a more complete pump product portfolio and from leveraging our current sales, distribution and service network. LPI products have proprietary niche applications that strategically complement our product portfolio. The goodwill related to this acquisition is recorded in the EPD segment and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Finite-lived intangible assets have expected weighted average useful lives of
ten
years.
Subsequent to October 28, 2011, the revenues and expenses of LPI have been included in our consolidated statements of income. No pro forma information has been provided due to immateriality. LPI generated approximately
$44
million in sales during its fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
Valbart Srl
Effective
July 16, 2010
, we acquired for inclusion in FCD,
100%

$199.4 million
, which included
$33.8 million
of existing Valbart net debt (defined as Valbarts third party debt less cash on hand) that was repaid at closing. Valbart manufactures trunnion-mounted ball valves used primarily in upstream and midstream oil and gas applications, which enables us to offer a more complete valve product portfolio to our oil and gas project customers. The acquisition included Valbarts portion of the joint venture with us that we entered into in December 2009 that was not operational during 2010. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we deposited
$5.8 million
into escrow to be held and applied against any breach of representations, warranties or indemnities for
30 months
. At the expiration of the escrow, any residual amounts shall be released to the sellers in satisfaction of the purchase price.

Calder AG
Effective
April 21, 2009
, we acquired for inclusion in EPD, Calder AG ("Calder"), a private Swiss company and a supplier of energy recovery technology for use in the global desalination market, for up to
$44.1 million
, net of cash acquired. Of the total purchase price,
$28.4 million
was paid at closing and
$2.4 million
was paid after the working capital valuation was completed in early July 2009. The remaining
$13.3 million
of the total purchase price was contingent upon Calder achieving certain performance metrics during the twelve months following the acquisition, and, to the extent achieved, was expected to be paid in cash within 12 months of the acquisition date. We initially recognized a liability of
$4.4 million
as an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration, which was based on the weighted probability of achievement of the performance metrics over a specified period of time as of the date of the acquisition.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the acquisition date fair value of the total purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. No pro forma information has been provided due to immateriality.
During the second half of 2009, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was reduced to
$0
based on 2009 results and an updated weighted probability of achievement of the performance metrics. The resulting gain was included in SG&A in our consolidated statement of income. The final measurement date of the performance metrics was March 31, 2010. The performance metrics were not met, resulting in no payment of contingent consideration.

Stock Options
  Options granted to officers, other employees and directors allow for the purchase of common shares at or above the market value of our stock on the date the options are granted, although no options have been granted above market value. Generally, options, whether granted under the 2004 Plan or other previously approved plans, become exercisable over a staggered period ranging from
one
to
five
years (most typically from
one
to
three
years). At
December 31, 2011

Restricted Shares
  Generally, the restrictions on Restricted Shares do not expire for a minimum of
one
year and a maximum of
four
years, and shares are subject to forfeiture during the restriction period. Most typically, Restricted Share grants have staggered vesting periods over
one
to
three
years from grant date. The intrinsic value of the Restricted Shares, which is typically the product of share price at the date of grant and the number of Restricted Shares granted, is amortized on a straight-line basis to compensation expense over the periods in which the restrictions lapse.
Unearned compensation is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the Restricted Shares. As of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, we had
$27.0
 million and
$31.6
 million, respectively, of unearned compensation cost related to unvested Restricted Shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately

The following table summarizes information regarding Restricted Shares:
Unvested Restricted Shares outstanding as of
December 31, 2011
, includes
415,000
 units with performance-based vesting provisions. Performance-based units are issuable in common stock and vest upon the achievement of pre-defined performance targets, primarily based on our average annual return on net assets over a
three
-year period as compared with the same measure for a defined peer group for the same period. Most units were granted in three annual grants since January 1, 2009 and have a vesting percentage between
0%
and
200%
depending on the achievement of the specific performance targets. Compensation expense is recognized over a
36
-month cliff vesting period based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, as adjusted for anticipated forfeitures. During the performance period, earned and unearned compensation expense is adjusted based on changes in the expected achievement of the performance targets. Vesting provisions range from
0
to
817,000
 shares based on performance targets. As of
December 31, 2011
, we estimate vesting of
744,000
 shares based on expected achievement of performance targets.
Our risk management and derivatives policy specifies the conditions under which we may enter into derivative contracts. See Note 1 for additional information on our purpose for entering into derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and our overall risk management strategies. We enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge our risks associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the operation engaging in the transaction. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, we had
$481.2 million

$358.5 million
, respectively, of notional amount in outstanding forward exchange contracts with third parties. At
December 31, 2011
, the length of forward exchange contracts currently in place ranged from
3 days to 19 months
.
Also as part of our risk management program, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge exposure to floating interest rates on certain portions of our debt. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, we had
$330.0 million
and
$350.0 million

effective. At
December 31, 2011
, the maximum remaining length of any interest rate contract in place was approximately
30 months
.
We are exposed to risk from credit-related losses resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments. We perform credit evaluations of our counterparties under forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements and expect all counterparties to meet their obligations.

Beginning in
2009
, we initiated realignment programs to reduce and optimize certain non-strategic manufacturing facilities and our overall cost structure by improving our operating efficiency, reducing redundancies, maximizing global consistency and driving improved financial performance, as well as expanding our efforts to optimize assets, respond to reduced orders and drive an enhanced customer-facing organization ("Realignment Programs"). These programs are substantially complete as we currently expect total Realignment Program charges will be approximately
$93
 million for approved plans, of which
$91.2
 million has been incurred through
December 31, 2011
.
The Realignment Programs consist of both restructuring and non-restructuring charges. Restructuring charges represent costs associated with the relocation of certain business activities, outsourcing of some business activities and facility closures. Non-restructuring charges are costs incurred to improve operating efficiency and reduce redundancies and primarily represent employee severance. Expenses are reported in COS or SG&A, as applicable, in our consolidated statements of income.
Charges, net of adjustments, related to our Realignment Programs were
$4.8
 million,
$18.3
million and
$68.1
million for year ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively.
Generally, the aforementioned charges were or will be paid in cash, except for asset write-downs, which are non-cash charges. Asset write-down charges of
$3.0
 million,
$6.4
 million and
$6.1 million
were recorded during
2011
,
2010
and

$7.1 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010

2011
.
In addition, in connection with our previously announced IPD recovery plan, in the second quarter of
2011
we initiated new activities to optimize structural parts of IPD's business. We expect charges related to this program to be non-restructuring in nature and will approximate
$9
million, of which
$7.2
 million was incurred in 2011 with the substantial majority recorded in COS.
Our financial instruments are presented at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models may be applied. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Hierarchical levels are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities. Recurring fair value measurements are limited to investments in derivative instruments and some equity securities.

Credit Facilities
On December 14, 2010 we entered into a credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as swingline lender, letter of credit issuer and administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (together, the "Lenders"). The Credit Agreement provides for a
$500.0 million
term loan facility with a maturity date of
December 14, 2015
and a
$500.0 million
revolving credit facility with a maturity date of
December 14, 2015
(collectively referred to as "Credit Facilities"). The revolving credit facility includes a
$300.0 million
sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the amount of the revolving credit facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed
$200.0 million
.
At
December 31, 2011
we had
$9.8 million
in deferred loan costs included in other assets, net. These costs are being amortized over the term of the Credit Agreement and are recorded in interest expense.
At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, respectively. We had outstanding letters of credit of
$147.4 million
and
$133.9 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively, which reduced our borrowing capacity to
$352.6 million
and
$366.1 million
, respectively.
Borrowings under our Credit Facilities, other than in respect of swingline loans, bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus
1.75%
 to
2.50%
, as applicable, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio, or, (2) the base rate which is based on the greater of the prime rate most recently announced by the administrative agent under our Credit Facilities or the Federal Funds rate plus
0.50%
, or (3) a daily rate equal to the one month LIBOR plus
1.0%
plus an applicable margin of
0.75%
 to
1.50%
determined by reference to the ratio of our total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). The applicable interest rate as of
December 31, 2011
was
2.58%
for borrowings under our New Credit Facilities. In connection with our Credit Facilities, we have entered into
$330.0
million of notional amount of interest rate swaps at
December 31, 2011
to hedge exposure to floating interest rates.
We pay the Lenders under the Credit Facilities a commitment fee equal to a percentage ranging from
0.30%
to
0.50%
, determined by reference to the ratio of our total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of the unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility, and letter of credit fees with respect to each standby letter of credit outstanding under our Credit Facilities equal to a percentage based on the applicable margin in effect for LIBOR borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The fees for financial and performance standby letters of credit are
2.0%
and
1.0%
, respectively.
Our obligations under the Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by substantially all of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries and
65%
of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain controlled company and materiality exceptions. The Lenders have agreed to release the collateral if we achieve an Investment Grade Rating by both Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poors Ratings Services for our senior unsecured, non-credit-enhanced, long-term debt (in each case, with an outlook of stable or better), with the understanding that identical collateral will be required to be pledged to the Lenders anytime following a release of the collateral that the Investment Grade Rating is not maintained. In addition, prior to our obtaining and maintaining investment grade credit ratings, our and the guarantors obligations under the Credit Facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our and the guarantors assets. We have not achieved these ratings as of
December 31, 2011
.
Our Credit Agreement contains, among other things, covenants defining our and our subsidiaries ability to dispose of assets, merge, pay dividends, repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness, incur indebtedness and guarantees, create liens, enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses, make certain investments or acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates or engage in any business activity other than our existing business. Our Credit Agreement also contains covenants requiring us to deliver to lenders our leverage and interest coverage financial covenant certificates of compliance. The maximum permitted leverage ratio is
3.25
times debt to total consolidated EBITDA. The minimum interest coverage is
3.25
times consolidated EBITDA to total interest expense. Compliance with these financial covenants under our Credit Agreement is tested quarterly. We complied with the covenants through
December 31, 2011
.
Our Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal or interest, violation of covenants, incorrectness of representations and warranties, cross defaults and cross acceleration, bankruptcy, material judgments, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), events, actual or asserted invalidity of the guarantees or the security documents, and certain changes of control of our company. The occurrence of any event of default could result in the acceleration of our and the guarantors obligations under the Credit Facilities.
Repayment of Obligations
  We made total scheduled repayments under our current Credit Agreement and previous credit agreement of
$25.0 million
,
$4.3 million
, and
$5.7 million
in
2011
,
2010

We may prepay loans under our Credit Facilities in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any time.
European Letter of Credit Facilities
  On
October 30, 2009
, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured European Letter of Credit Facility ("New European LOC Facility") with an initial commitment of
125.0 million
. The New European LOC Facility is renewable annually and, consistent with our previous European Letter of Credit Facility ("Old European LOC Facility"), is used for contingent obligations in respect of surety and performance bonds, bank guarantees and similar obligations with maturities up to
five
years. We renewed the New European LOC Facility in
October 2011
consistent with its terms for an additional 364-day period. We pay fees between
1.10%
and
1.35%
for utilized capacity and
0.40%
for unutilized capacity under our New European LOC Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit drawn on the New European LOC Facility of
81.0 million
(
$105.0 million
) and
55.7 million
(
$74.5 million
) as of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively.
Our ability to issue additional letters of credit under our Old European LOC Facility, which had a commitment of
110.0 million
, expired
November 9, 2009
. We paid annual and fronting fees of
0.875%
and
0.10%
, respectively, for letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility. We had outstanding letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility of
12.2 million
(
$15.8 million
) and
33.3 million
(
$44.5 million
) as of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively.
Certain banks are parties to both facilities and are managing their exposures on an aggregated basis. As such, the commitment under the New European LOC Facility is reduced by the face amount of existing letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility prior to its expiration. These existing letters of credit will remain outstanding, and accordingly offset the
125.0 million
capacity of the New European LOC Facility until their maturity, which, as of
December 31, 2011
, was approximately
one
year for the majority of the outstanding existing letters of credit. After consideration of outstanding commitments under both facilities, the available capacity under the New European LOC Facility was
116.7 million
as of
December 31, 2011
, of which
81.0 million
has been utilized.
Operating Leases
  We have non-cancelable operating leases for certain offices, service and quick response centers, certain manufacturing and operating facilities, machinery, equipment and automobiles. Rental expense relating to operating leases was
$52.8 million

We sponsor several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and certain non-U.S. employees, which provide benefits based on years of service, age, job grade levels and type of compensation. Retirement benefits for all other covered employees are provided through contributory pension plans, cash balance pension plans and government-sponsored retirement programs. All funded defined benefit pension plans receive funding based on independent actuarial valuations to provide for current service and an amount sufficient to amortize unfunded prior service over periods not to exceed 30 years, with funding falling within the legal limits prescribed by prevailing regulation. We also maintain unfunded defined benefit plans that, as permitted by local regulations, receive funding only when benefits become due.
Our defined benefit plan strategy is to ensure that current and future benefit obligations are adequately funded in a cost-effective manner. Additionally, our investing objective is to achieve the highest level of investment performance that is compatible with our risk tolerance and prudent investment practices. Because of the long-term nature of our defined benefit plan liabilities, our funding strategy is based on a long-term perspective for formulating and implementing investment policies and evaluating their investment performance.

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
The asset allocation of our defined benefit plans reflect our decision about the proportion of the investment in equity and fixed income securities, and, where appropriate, the various sub-asset classes of each. At least annually, we complete a comprehensive review of our asset allocation policy and the underlying assumptions, which includes our long-term capital markets rate of return assumptions and our risk tolerances relative to our defined benefit plan liabilities.
The expected rates of return on defined benefit plan assets are derived from review of the asset allocation strategy, expected long-term performance of asset classes, risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. These rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates.
Our U.S. defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of U.S. equity and fixed income securities. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets include a significant concentration of United Kingdom ("U.K.") equity and fixed income securities. We monitor investment allocations and manage plan assets to maintain acceptable levels of risk.
In addition, certain of our defined benefit plans hold investments in European equity and fixed income securities.
For all periods presented, we used a measurement date of December 31 for all of our worldwide pension and postretirement medical plans.
U.S. Defined Benefit Plans
  We maintain qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. The qualified plan provides coverage for substantially all full-time U.S. employees who receive benefits, up to an earnings threshold specified by the U.S. Department of Labor. The non-qualified plans primarily cover a small number of employees including current and former members of senior management, providing them with benefit levels equivalent to other participants, but that are otherwise limited by U.S. Department of Labor rules. The U.S. plans are designed to operate as "cash balance" arrangements, under which the employee has the option to take a lump sum payment at the end of their service. The total accumulated benefit obligation is equivalent to the total projected benefit obligation ("Benefit Obligation").
The following are assumptions related to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans:
At
December 31, 2011
as compared to
December 31, 2010
, we decreased our discount rate from
5.00%
to
4.50%
based on an analysis of publicly-traded investment grade U.S. corporate bonds, which had a lower yield due to current market conditions. At
December 31, 2011
as compared to
December 31, 2010
our average assumed rate of compensation remained constant at
4.25%
. In determining
2011
expense, we decreased the expected rate of return on assets from
7.00%
to
6.25%
, primarily based on our target allocations and expected long-term asset returns. The long-term rate of return assumption is calculated using a quantitative approach that utilizes unadjusted historical returns and asset allocation as inputs for the calculation.

All U.S. defined benefit plan assets are held by the qualified plan. The asset allocation for the qualified plan at the end of
2011
and
2010
by asset category, are as follows:
_______________________________________
None of our common stock is directly held by our qualified plan. Our investment strategy is to earn a long-term rate of return consistent with an acceptable degree of risk and minimize our cash contributions over the life of the plan, while taking into account the liquidity needs of the plan. We preserve capital through diversified investments in high quality securities. Our current allocation target is to invest approximately
50%
of plan assets in equity securities and
50%
in fixed income securities. Within each investment category, assets are allocated to various investment strategies. A professional money management firm manages our assets, and we engage a consultant to assist in evaluating these activities. We periodically review the allocation target, generally in conjunction with an asset and liability study and in consideration of our future cash flow needs. We regularly rebalance the actual allocation to our target investment allocation.
Plan assets are invested in commingled funds and the individual funds are actively managed with the intent to outperform specified benchmarks. Our "Pension and Investment Committee" is responsible for setting the investment strategy and the target asset allocation, as well as selecting individual funds. As the qualified plan is approaching fully funded status, we are working toward the implementation of a Liability-Driven Investing ("LDI") strategy, which will more closely align the duration of the assets with the duration of the liabilities. An LDI strategy will result in an asset portfolio that more closely matches the behavior of the liability, thereby protecting the funded status of the plan.

as compared to
December 31, 2010
, we decreased our average discount rate for non-U.S. plans from

6.21%
at
December 31, 2010
to
6.13%
at
December 31, 2011
, primarily as a result of the decrease in the U.K. rate of return on assets resulting from changes in the target allocations. As the expected rate of return on plan assets is long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates.
Many of our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are unfunded, as permitted by local regulation. The expected long-term rate of return on assets for funded plans was determined by assessing the rates of return for each asset class and is calculated using a quantitative approach that utilizes unadjusted historical returns and asset allocation as inputs for the calculation. We work with our actuaries to determine the reasonableness of our long-term rate of return assumptions by looking at several factors including historical returns, expected future returns, asset allocation, risks by asset class and other items.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans with Accumulated Benefit Obligations in Excess of Plan Assets
  The following summarizes key pension plan information regarding U.S. and non-U.S. plans whose accumulated benefit obligations exceed the fair value of their respective plan assets.
Postretirement Medical Plans
  We sponsor several defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the U.S. These plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. The plans include participant contributions, deductibles, co-insurance provisions and other limitations and are integrated with Medicare and other group plans. We fund the plans as benefits and health maintenance organization premiums are paid, such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented. Accordingly, we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets. Benefits under our postretirement medical plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees.
The following are assumptions related to postretirement benefits:
The assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in medical costs used to determine net expense were
8.5%
for
2011
,
9.0%
for
2010
and
9.0%
for

Defined Contribution Plans
  We sponsor several defined contribution plans covering substantially all U.S. and Canadian employees and certain other non-U.S. employees. Employees may contribute to these plans, and these contributions are matched in varying amounts by us, including opportunities for discretionary matching contributions by us. Defined contribution plan expense was
$17.8
 million in
2011
,
$17.3
 million in
2010
and
$16.7
 million in
2009
.
Participants in the U.S. defined contribution plan have the option to invest in our common stock and, prior to 2009, discretionary contributions by us were funded with our common stock; therefore, the plan assets include such holdings of our common stock.
Asbestos-Related Claims
We are a defendant in a substantial number of lawsuits that seek to recover damages for personal injury allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured and/or distributed by our heritage companies in the past. While the overall number of asbestos-related claims has generally declined in recent years, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue, or that the average cost per claim will not further increase. Asbestos-containing materials incorporated into any such products were primarily encapsulated and used as internal components of process equipment, and we do not believe that any significant emission of asbestos fibers occurred during the use of this equipment.
 
Our practice is to vigorously contest and resolve these claims, and we have been successful in resolving a majority of claims with little or no payment. Historically, a high percentage of resolved claims have been covered by applicable insurance or indemnities from other companies, and we believe that a substantial majority of existing claims should continue to be covered by insurance or indemnities. Accordingly, we have recorded a liability for our estimate of the most likely settlement of asserted claims and a related receivable from insurers or other companies for our estimated recovery, to the extent we believe that the amounts of recovery are probable and not otherwise in dispute. While unfavorable rulings, judgments or settlement terms regarding these claims could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we currently believe the likelihood is remote.
In one asbestos insurance related matter, we have a claim in litigation against relevant insurers substantially in excess of the recorded receivable. If our claim is resolved more favorably than reflected in this receivable, we would benefit from a one-time gain in the amount of such excess.
We are currently unable to estimate the impact, if any, of unasserted asbestos-related claims, although future claims would also be subject to existing indemnities and insurance coverage.

United Nations Oil-for-Food Program
In mid-2006, French authorities began an investigation of over
170
French companies, of which our French subsidiary was included, concerning suspected inappropriate activities conducted in connection with the United Nations Oil for Food Program. As anticipated and as previously disclosed, the French investigation of our French subsidiary was formally opened in the first quarter of 2010, and our French subsidiary has filed a formal response with the French court. We currently do not expect to incur additional case resolution costs of a material amount in this matter; however, if the French authorities take enforcement action against our French subsidiary regarding its investigation, we may be subject to monetary and non-monetary penalties, which we currently do not believe will have a material adverse effect on our company.
In addition to the governmental investigation referenced above, on June 27, 2008, the Republic of Iraq filed a civil suit in federal court in New York against

While we cannot predict the outcome of the suit at the present time, we do not currently believe the resolution of this suit will have a material adverse financial impact on our company.
Export Compliance
As previously reported, in March 2006, we initiated a voluntary systematic process to determine our compliance with respect to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations. Our process included the onsite review of approximately
40
sites globally and addressed the period of October 1, 2002 through October 1, 2007. At the end of 2008, we completed comprehensive disclosures to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") and the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") regarding the results of our review process, and we continued to work closely with authorities over the next several years to supplement and clarify specific aspects of our voluntary disclosures.
Based on the results of our review process, we determined and voluntarily self-disclosed that certain of our domestic and foreign affiliates engaged in unlicensed exports and reexports of pumps, valves and related components to Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba and various other countries. As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, and as disclosed in the public releases of both BIS and OFAC, in late September 2011, we entered into settlement agreements with both BIS and OFAC that resolved in full all matters contained in our voluntary self-disclosures. Under the settlements, we agreed to pay a civil penalty of
$2.5 million
to BIS to settle

charges of unlicensed exports and reexports to Iran, Syria and various other countries and
$0.5 million
to OFAC to settle charges alleging
58
violations of OFAC's Iranian, Cuban and Sudanese sanctioned programs. As a part of our settlement with BIS, we also agreed to conduct a one-time, post-settlement compliance audit of
16
company sites located in the U.S. and overseas. The full amount of the civil penalties and the expected cost of the audit approximated the reserve previously established for the matter. As disclosed, effective January 1, 2012, our foreign subsidiaries substantially completed the voluntary winding down of business in these countries.
Other
We are currently involved as a potentially responsible party at
seven
former public waste disposal sites in various stages of evaluation or remediation. The projected cost of remediation at these sites, as well as our alleged fair share allocation, will remain uncertain until all studies have been completed and the parties have either negotiated an amicable resolution or the matter has been judicially resolved. At each site, there are many other parties who have similarly been identified. Many of the other parties identified are financially strong and solvent companies that appear able to pay their share of the remediation costs. Based on our information about the waste disposal practices at these sites and the environmental regulatory process in general, we believe that it is likely that ultimate remediation liability costs for each site will be apportioned among all liable parties, including site owners and waste transporters, according to the volumes and/or toxicity of the wastes shown to have been disposed of at the sites. We believe that our exposure for existing disposal sites will not be material.
 
We are also a defendant in a number of other lawsuits, including product liability claims, that are insured, subject to the applicable deductibles, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are also involved in other uninsured routine litigation incidental to our business. We currently believe none of such litigation, either individually or in the aggregate, is material to our business, operations or overall financial condition. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and resolutions or dispositions of claims or lawsuits by settlement or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the reporting period in which any such resolution or disposition occurs.

Although none of the aforementioned potential liabilities can be quantified with absolute certainty except as otherwise indicated above, we have established reserves covering exposures relating to contingencies, to the extent believed to be reasonably estimable and probable based on past experience and available facts. While additional exposures beyond these reserves could exist, they currently cannot be estimated. We will continue to evaluate and update the reserves as necessary and appropriate.
We have recorded reserves for product warranty claims that are included in both current and noncurrent liabilities. The following is a summary of the activity in the warranty reserve:

On
February 27, 2008
, our Board of Directors announced the approval of a program to repurchase up to
$300.0 million

The provision for income taxes consists of the following:
The expected cash payments for the current income tax expense for
2011
,
2010
and
2009
were reduced by
$5.7 million
,
$10.0 million
and
$0.4 million
, respectively, as a result of tax deductions related to the exercise of non-qualified employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock. The income tax benefit resulting from these stock-based compensation plans has increased capital in excess of par value.
The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory corporate rate due to the following:
The net increase (decrease) in valuation allowances in the rate reconciliation above includes a net increase (reduction) of foreign valuation allowances of
$3.5 million
,
$(2.3) million
and
$0.9 million
in
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively.
The
2011
,
2010
and
2009
effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of
35%
primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, which included the impacts of lower foreign tax rates, and changes in our reserves established for uncertain tax positions.
We assert permanent reinvestment on the majority of invested capital and unremitted foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. However, we do not assert permanent reinvestment on a limited number of foreign subsidiaries where future distributions may occur. The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings considered permanently reinvested is
$1.3 billion
. Should these permanently reinvested earnings be repatriated in a future period in the form of dividends or otherwise, our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period. During each of the three years reported in the period ended
December 31,

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
2011
, we have not recognized any net deferred tax assets attributable to excess foreign tax credits on unremitted earnings or foreign currency translation adjustments in our foreign subsidiaries with excess financial reporting basis.
For those subsidiaries where permanent reinvestment was not asserted, we had cash and deemed dividend distributions that resulted in the recognition of
$9.5 million
,
$8.2 million
and
$2.4 million
of income tax benefit during the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively. As we have not recorded a benefit for the excess foreign tax credits associated with deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings, these credits are not available to offset the liability associated with these dividends.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the consolidated deferred tax assets and liabilities were:
We have
$157.9 million
of U.S. and foreign net operating loss carryforwards at

$37.1 million
are state net operating losses. Net operating losses generated in the U.S., if unused, will expire in 2012 through 2026. The majority of our non-U.S. net operating losses carry forward without expiration. Additionally, we have
$43.4 million
of foreign tax credit carryforwards at

A tabular reconciliation of the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions):
The amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits at
December 31, 2011
was
$118.8 million
, which includes
$25.0 million
of accrued interest and penalties. Of this amount
$75.2 million
, if recognized, would favorably impact our effective tax rate. During the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
we recognized net interest and penalty (income) expense of
$(1.9) million
,
$(2.3) million
and
$4.4 million
, respectively, in our consolidated statement of income.
With limited exception, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax audits for years through 2007 or non-U.S. income tax audits for years through 2004. We are currently under examination for various years in China, Germany, India, Italy, Singapore, the U.S. and Venezuela.
It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the effective tax rate will be impacted by the resolution of some or all of the matters audited by various taxing authorities. It is also reasonably possible that we will have the statute of limitations close in various taxing jurisdictions within the next 12 months. As such, we estimate we could record a reduction in our tax expense of between
$15.9 million
and
$25.7 million
within the next 12 months.
We are principally engaged in the worldwide design, manufacture, distribution and service of industrial flow management equipment. We provide long lead-time, custom and other highly engineered pumps; standardized, general purpose pumps; mechanical seals; industrial valves; and related automation products and solutions primarily for oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management and other general industries requiring flow management products and services.
Our business segments, defined below, share a focus on industrial flow control technology and have a high number of common customers. These segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications which provide us a net competitive advantage. Our segments also benefit from our global footprint and our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively.

During 2011, the President of FSG reported directly to the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and the FSG Vice President - Finance reported directly to our Chief Accounting Officer ("CAO"). The structure of FSG consists of
two
reportable operating segments: EPD and IPD. During 2011, FCD had a President, who reported directly to our CEO, and a Vice President - Finance, who reported directly to our CAO. For decision-making purposes, our CEO and other members of senior executive management use financial information generated and reported at the reportable segment level. Our corporate headquarters does not constitute a separate division or business segment. On January 11, 2012, a new unified operational leadership structure was announced resulting in the creation of a Chief Operating Officer position, in lieu of the above segment President structure. The creation of this position did not impact how we have defined the above three business segments or our assessment of our CEO as the chief operating decision maker.
We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each reportable segments operating income. Amounts classified as "Eliminations and All Other" include corporate headquarters costs and other minor entities that do not constitute separate segments.

European Sovereign Debt Crisis
 At
June 30, 2012
, we had no direct investments in European sovereign or non-sovereign debt. However, certain of our defined benefit plans hold investments in European equity and fixed income securities as discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2011 Annual Report. Other than broad, macro-level economic impacts, including foreign exchange rate impacts, we did not experience any direct or measurable disruptions during the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 due to the European sovereign debt crisis. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of any future developments in the region on our current business, our customers and suppliers and the state of the global economy.
Events in North Africa and Middle East
 As previously disclosed in our 2011 Annual Report, during 2011 political and economic conditions in North Africa caused us to experience shipment delays to this region. For the three and six months ended
June 30, 2012
there was
no
impact to operating income due to delayed shipments to this region. The preponderance of our physical assets in the region are located in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and have, to date, not been significantly affected by the unrest elsewhere in the region.
Accounting Policies
Significant accounting policies, for which no significant changes have occurred in the six months ended
June 30, 2012
, are detailed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2011 Annual Report.
Accounting Developments
Pronouncements Implemented
In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-04, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs," which clarifies the requirements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in order to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs"). The amendments do not result in a major change in the application of the requirements in Topic 820, but clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and change particular principles or requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. Our adoption of ASU No. 2011-04, effective January 1, 2012, had no impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income (Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income," which specifies that an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This amendment also requires an entity to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, "Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05," to defer the requirement to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income. Our adoption of ASU Nos. 2011-05 and 2011-12, effective January 1, 2012, had no impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
5
Table of Contents
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment," which specifies that an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Our adoption of ASU No. 2011-08, effective January 1, 2012, had no impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
 
Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, "Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities," which requires enhanced disclosures about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset in accordance with either ASC 210-20-45, "Balance Sheet - Offsetting," or ASC 815-10-45, "Derivatives and Hedging - Overall," or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45. ASU No. 2011-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 31, 2012. The disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The adoption of ASU No. 2011-11 will not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Lawrence Pumps, Inc.
As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2011 Annual Report, effective October 28, 2011, we acquired for inclusion in Engineered Product Division ("EPD"),
100%

LPI specializes in the design, development and manufacture of engineered centrifugal slurry pumps for critical services within the petroleum refining, petrochemical, pulp and paper and energy markets. No pro forma financial information has been presented due to immateriality.
We established the Flowserve Corporation Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2010 Plan") effective
January 1, 2010
. This shareholder-approved plan authorizes the issuance of up to
2,900,000
shares of our common stock in the form of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted shares, restricted share units and performance-based units (collectively referred to as "Restricted Shares"), stock appreciation rights and bonus stock. Of the
2,900,000
shares of common stock authorized under the 2010 Plan,
2,162,227
remain available for issuance as of
June 30, 2012
. In addition to the 2010 Plan, we also maintain the Flowserve Corporation 2004 Stock Compensation Plan (the "2004 Plan"), which was established on
April 21, 2004.
The 2004 Plan authorized the issuance of up to
3,500,000
shares of common stock through grants of Restricted Shares, stock options and other equity-based awards. Of the
3,500,000
shares of common stock authorized under the 2004 Plan,
275,945
remain available for issuance as of
June 30, 2012
.
No
stock options have been granted since 2006.
 
Restricted Shares
 Awards of Restricted Shares are valued at the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The unearned compensation is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the restricted shares. We had unearned compensation of
$42.0 million
and 
$27.0 million
at
June 30, 2012
and
December 31, 2011
, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
two
years. These amounts will be recognized into net earnings in prospective periods as the awards vest. The total fair value of Restricted Shares vested during each of the three months ended
June 30, 2012
and
2011
was
$1.2
 million. The total fair value of Restricted Shares vested during the six months ended
June 30, 2012
and
2011
was
$36.2 million
and
$34.8 million
, respectively.
We recorded stock-based compensation expense of
$5.1 million
(
$7.6 million
pre-tax) and
$5.2 million
(
$7.7 million
pre-tax) for the three months ended
June 30, 2012
and
2011
, respectively. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of
$10.2 million
(
$15.4 million
pre-tax) and
$11.0 million
(
$16.3 million
pre-tax) for the six months ended
June 30, 2012
and
2011
, respectively.

Table of Contents
The following table summarizes information regarding Restricted Shares:
Unvested Restricted Shares outstanding as of
June 30, 2012
, includes approximately
324,000
units with performance-based vesting provisions. Performance-based units are issuable in common stock and vest upon the achievement of pre-defined performance targets, primarily based on our average annual return on net assets over a
three
-year period as compared with the same measure for a defined peer group for the same period. Most units were granted in three annual grants since January 1, 2010 and have a vesting percentage between
0%
and
200%
depending on the achievement of the specific performance targets. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over a cliff-vesting period of
36 months
, based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, as adjusted for anticipated forfeitures. During the performance period, earned and unearned compensation expense is adjusted based on changes in the expected achievement of the performance targets. Vesting provisions range from
0
to
643,000
shares based on performance targets. As of
June 30, 2012
, we estimate vesting of approximately
451,000
shares based on expected achievement of performance targets.
Our risk management and derivatives policy specifies the conditions under which we may enter into derivative contracts. See Notes 1 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in our
2011
Annual Report and Note 6 of this Quarterly Report for additional information on our derivatives. We enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge our cash flow risks associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the operation engaging in the transaction. At
June 30, 2012
and
December 31, 2011
, we had
$535.6
million and
$481.2
 million, respectively, of notional amount in outstanding forward exchange contracts with third parties. At
June 30, 2012
, the length of forward exchange contracts currently in place ranged from
two
 days to
18
 months. Also as part of our risk management program, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge exposure to floating interest rates on certain portions of our debt. At
June 30, 2012
and
December 31, 2011
, we had
$325.0
 million and
$330.0
million, respectively, of notional amount in outstanding interest rate swaps with third parties. All interest rate swaps are highly effective. At
June 30, 2012
, the maximum remaining length of any interest rate swap contract in place was approximately
36
 months.
We are exposed to risk from credit-related losses resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments. We perform credit evaluations of our counterparties under forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements and expect all counterparties to meet their obligations. If material, we would adjust the values of our derivative contracts for our or our counterparties credit risks. We have not experienced credit losses from our counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments are summarized below:

Credit Facilities
As described more fully in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2011 Annual Report, on December 14, 2010, we entered into a credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as swingline lender, letter of credit issuer and administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a
$500.0 million
term loan facility with a maturity date of December 14, 2015 and a 
$500.0 million
revolving credit facility with a maturity date of December 14, 2015 (collectively referred to as the "Credit Facilities"). As of June 30, 2012, we had
$50.0 million
outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility includes a
$300.0 million
sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the amount of the revolving credit facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed 
$200.0 million
. We had outstanding letters of credit of
$155.4 million
and 
$147.4 million
at
June 30, 2012
and
December 31, 2011
, respectively, and when included with the outstanding revolving credit facility balance, reduced our borrowing capacity to 
$294.6 million
and
$352.6 million
, respectively.
We may prepay loans under our Credit Facilities in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any time. During the three and six months ended
June 30, 2012
, we made scheduled repayments under our Credit Facilities of
$6.3 million
and
$12.5 million
, respectively. We have scheduled repayments of
$56.3 million
due in the third quarter of 2012,
$6.3 million
in the fourth quarter of 2012 and
$12.5 million
due in both the first and second quarters of 2013 on our Credit Facilities. Our Credit Facilities bear a floating rate of interest and we have entered into
$325.0
 million of notional amount of interest rate swaps at
June 30, 2012
to hedge exposure to floating interest rates.
Bridge Loan
On
June 15, 2012
(the Closing Date), we entered into a loan agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (together, the Lenders), providing for a term loan with an aggregate commitment of
$250.0 million
for a term of
364 days
(the Bridge Loan). The proceeds from the Bridge Loan were used to fund our share repurchase program described in Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.
The initial interest rate per annum applicable to the Bridge Loan is either
LIBOR
plus
2.50%
,
2.25%
,
2.00%
or
1.75%
, as applicable, depending on the consolidated leverage ratio, or, at our option, the Base Rate (defined as a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the
Prime Rate
in effect on such day, (b) the
Federal Funds Rate
in effect on such day plus
0.5%
or (c) the
Eurodollar Rate
for a one month Interest Period on such day plus
1%
). The applicable interest rate will increase by
50
basis points incrementally during the term of the Bridge Loan on each of the
90-day
,
180-day
and
270-day
anniversaries of the Closing Date. Additionally, a duration fee will be payable on the loan amount as follows:
0.125%
on October 15, 2012;
0.25%
on December 15, 2012; and
0.5%
on March 15, 2013.
The Bridge Loan includes customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default, including maintenance of interest coverage and consolidated leverage ratios, all of which are consistent in all material respects with our existing Credit Facilities. The obligations under the Bridge Loan are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.
 
European Letter of Credit Facilities
 On October 30, 2009, we entered into a 364-day unsecured European Letter of Credit Facility ("European LOC Facility") with an initial commitment of
125.0 million
. The European LOC Facility is renewable annually and is used for contingent obligations in respect of surety and performance bonds, bank guarantees and similar obligations with maturities
up to five years
. We renewed the European LOC Facility in October 2011 consistent with its initial terms for an additional 364-day period. We had outstanding letters of credit drawn on the European LOC Facility of
74.4 million
(
$94.2 million
) and
81.0 million
(
$105.0 million
) as of
June 30, 2012
and
December 31, 2011
, respectively.
Our ability to issue additional letters of credit under our previous European Letter of Credit Facility ("Old European LOC Facility"), which had a commitment of
110.0 million
, expired November 9, 2009. We had outstanding letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility of
5.8 million
(
$7.3 million
) and
12.2 million
(
$15.8 million
) as of
June 30, 2012
and
December 31, 2011
, respectively.
Certain banks are parties to both facilities and are managing their exposures on an aggregated basis. As such, the commitment under the European LOC Facility is reduced by the face amount of existing letters of credit written against the Old European LOC Facility prior to its expiration. After consideration of outstanding commitments under both facilities, the available capacity under the European LOC Facility was
121.0 million
(
$153.2 million
) as of
June 30, 2012
, of which
74.4 million
(
$94.2 million
) has been utilized.
Our financial instruments are presented at fair value or approximate fair value in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models may be applied. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in our condensed consolidated balance sheets are categorized by hierarchical levels based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Recurring fair value measurements are limited to investments in derivative instruments and certain equity securities. The fair value measurements of our derivative instruments are determined using models that maximize the use of the observable market inputs including interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for currencies, and are classified as Level II under the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of our
8
derivatives are included above in Note 4. The fair value measurements of our investments in equity securities are determined using quoted market prices. The fair values of our investments in equity securities, and changes thereto, are immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. The fair value of our debt was estimated using interest rates on similar debt recently issued by companies with credit metrics similar to ours and is classified as Level II under the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of our debt is included above in Note 5 and approximates fair value.
Inventories, net consisted of the following:
As of
June 30, 2012
, we had investments in
eight
joint ventures (
one
located in each of Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates and
two
located in each of China and India) that were accounted for using the equity method. Summarized below is combined financial statement information, based on the most recent financial information (unaudited), for those investments:
The provision for income taxes is based on the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our investees operate. The taxation regimes vary not only by their nominal rates, but also by the allowability of deductions, credits and other benefits. Our share of net income is reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of income.

The following is a reconciliation of net earnings of Flowserve Corporation and weighted average shares for calculating net earnings per common share. Earnings per weighted average common share outstanding was calculated as follows:
Diluted earnings per share above is based upon the weighted average number of shares as determined for basic earnings per share plus shares potentially issuable in conjunction with stock options, restricted share units and performance share units.
For the three and six months ended both
June 30, 2012
and
2011
,
no
options to purchase common stock were excluded from the computation of potentially dilutive securities.
Asbestos-Related Claims
We are a defendant in a substantial number of lawsuits that seek to recover damages for personal injury allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured and/or distributed by our heritage companies in the past. While the overall number of asbestos-related claims has generally declined in recent years, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue, or that the average cost per claim will not further increase. Asbestos-containing materials incorporated into any such products were primarily encapsulated and used as internal components of process equipment, and we do not believe that any significant emission of asbestos fibers occurred during the use of this equipment.
10
Our practice is to vigorously contest and resolve these claims, and we have been successful in resolving a majority of claims with little or no payment. Historically, a high percentage of resolved claims have been covered by applicable insurance or indemnities from other companies, and we believe that a substantial majority of existing claims should continue to be covered by insurance or indemnities. Accordingly, we have recorded a liability for our estimate of the most likely settlement of asserted claims and a related receivable from insurers or other companies for our estimated recovery, to the extent we believe that the amounts of recovery are probable and not otherwise in dispute. While unfavorable rulings, judgments or settlement terms regarding these claims could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we currently believe the likelihood is remote. In one asbestos insurance related matter, we have a claim in litigation against relevant insurers substantially in excess of the recorded receivable. If our claim is resolved more favorably than reflected in this receivable, we would benefit from a gain in the amount of such excess. We are currently unable to estimate the impact, if any, of unasserted asbestos-related claims, although future claims would also be subject to then existing indemnities and insurance coverage.
United Nations Oil-for-Food Program
In mid-2006, French authorities began an investigation of over
170
French companies, of which our French subsidiary was included, concerning suspected inappropriate activities conducted in connection with the United Nations Oil for Food Program. As anticipated and as previously disclosed, the French investigation of our French subsidiary was formally opened in the first quarter of 2010, and our French subsidiary has filed a formal response with the French court. In July 2012, the French court ruled against our procedural motions to challenge the constitutionality of the charges and quash the indictment.  We are now in the process of filing a formal appeal with the French Supreme Court to seek a reversal of the French court decision.  We currently do not expect to incur additional case resolution costs of a material amount in this matter; however, if the French authorities take enforcement action against our French subsidiary regarding its investigation, we may be subject to monetary and non-monetary penalties, which we currently do not believe will have a material adverse effect on our company.
In addition to the governmental investigation referenced above, on June 27, 2008, the Republic of Iraq filed a civil suit in federal court in New York against
93
participants in the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program, including us and our
two
foreign subsidiaries that participated in the program. There have been no material developments in this case since it was initially filed. We intend to vigorously contest the suit, and we believe that we have valid defenses to the claims asserted. While we cannot predict the outcome of the suit at the present time, we do not currently believe the resolution of this suit will have a material adverse financial impact on our company.
Other
We are currently involved as a potentially responsible party at
seven
former public waste disposal sites in various stages of evaluation or remediation. The projected cost of remediation at these sites, as well as our alleged "fair share" allocation, will remain uncertain until all studies have been completed and the parties have either negotiated an amicable resolution or the matter has been judicially resolved. At each site, there are many other parties who have similarly been identified. Many of the other parties identified are financially strong and solvent companies that appear able to pay their share of the remediation costs. Based on our information about the waste disposal practices at these sites and the environmental regulatory process in general, we believe that it is likely that ultimate remediation liability costs for each site will be apportioned among all liable parties, including site owners and waste transporters, according to the volumes and/or toxicity of the wastes shown to have been disposed of at the sites. We believe that our exposure for existing disposal sites will not be material.
We are also a defendant in a number of other lawsuits, including product liability claims, that are insured, subject to the applicable deductibles, arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are also involved in other uninsured routine litigation incidental to our business. We currently believe none of such litigation, either individually or in the aggregate, is material to our business, operations or overall financial condition. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and resolutions or dispositions of claims or lawsuits by settlement or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the reporting period in which any such resolution or disposition occurs.
Although none of the aforementioned potential liabilities can be quantified with absolute certainty except as otherwise indicated above, we have established reserves covering exposures relating to contingencies, to the extent believed to be reasonably estimable and probable based on past experience and available facts. While additional exposures beyond these reserves could exist, they currently cannot be estimated. We will continue to evaluate and update the reserves as necessary and appropriate.

Components of the net periodic cost for retirement and postretirement benefits for the three months ended
June 30, 2012
and
2011
were as follows:
Components of the net periodic cost for retirement and postretirement benefits for the six months ended
June 30, 2012
and
2011
were as follows:
After consideration of our intent to maintain fully funded status, we currently anticipate our contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2012 will be between approximately
$10 million
and
$20 million
, excluding direct benefits paid. See additional discussion of our retirement and postretirement benefits in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in our
2011
Annual Report.
Dividends
 On February 20, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock from
$0.32
per share to
$0.36
per share payable quarterly beginning on April 13, 2012. Generally, our dividend date-of-record is in the last month of the quarter, and the dividend is paid the following month.
Share Repurchase Program
 On May 31, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors endorsed an updated capital structure strategy. A part of this capital structure strategy includes returning additional capital more quickly to shareholders through an expanded share repurchase program of
$1.0 billion
. The
$1.0 billion
share repurchase program authorization included approximately
$233 million
of remaining capacity under our prior share repurchase program, which was originally approved by our Board of Directors on September 12, 2011 and replenished on December 15, 2011. Our share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and we reserve the right to limit or terminate the repurchase program at anytime without notice.
As a part of the
$1.0 billion
share repurchase program, on June 14, 2012, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (the ASR Program) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as agent for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, under which we agreed to repurchase an aggregate of
$300.0 million
of our common stock. Under the ASR Program, we paid
$300.0 million
and received an initial delivery of
2,260,738
shares, representing
80%
of the ASR Program's value at the then-current price of
$106.16
per share. The remaining
20%
of the ASR Program's value will be delivered at program settlement, with the final number of shares to be repurchased based on the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount and adjusted for the initial share delivery. Under the terms of the ASR Program, at settlement, we could either receive additional shares from the counterparty or be required to deliver additional shares or cash, at our option, to the counterparty. The ASR Program will be complete by the end of 2012.
The ASR Program was accounted for as two separate transactions: (i) as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction and (ii) as a forward contract indexed to our own common stock. The initial delivery of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted net earnings per share from the effective date of the ASR Program. We have determined that the forward contract indexed to our common stock met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification. The ASR Program was funded through a combination of cash on hand, existing capacity on our revolving credit facility and proceeds from a new
$250.0 million
Bridge Loan, which is described in further detail in Note 5 above.
Inclusive of the ASR Program's
2,260,738
initial share delivery, representing 80% of the program's value, we repurchased
3,307,003
shares of our outstanding common stock for
$350.8 million
, and
100,000
shares for
$12.2 million
, during the three months ended
June 30, 2012
and
2011
, respectively. We repurchased
3,492,003
shares of our outstanding common stock for
$372.9 million
, and
212,500
shares for
$26.0 million
, during the six months ended
June 30, 2012
and
2011
, respectively. As of
June 30, 2012
, we have
$624.7 million
of remaining capacity under our current share repurchase program, which reflects the full
$300.0 million
value of the ASR Program, which will conclude by the end of 2012.
For the three months ended
June 30, 2012
, we earned
$148.1 million
before taxes and provided for income taxes of
$39.6 million
, resulting in an effective tax rate of
26.7%
. For the six months ended
June 30, 2012
, we earned
$277.1 million
before taxes and provided for income taxes of
$75.1 million
resulting in an effective tax rate of
27.1%
. The effective tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2012
primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations and a net reduction of our reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the lapse of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions.
For the three months ended
June 30, 2011
, we earned
$137.0 million
before taxes and provided for income taxes of
$38.2 million
, resulting in an effective tax rate of
27.9%
. For the six months ended
June 30, 2011
, we earned
$267.6 million
before taxes and provided for income taxes of
$71.9 million
, resulting in an effective tax rate of
26.9%
. The effective tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended
June 30, 2011
primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations. The effective tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the six months ended June 30, 2011 primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations and the lapse of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions.
As of
June 30, 2012
, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by
$3.2 million
from
December 31, 2011
, due to the net impacts of currency translation adjustments and expiration of statutes. With limited exception, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax audits for years through 2007 or non-U.S. income tax audits for years through 2004. We are currently under examination for various years in China, Germany, India, Italy, Singapore, the U.S. and Venezuela.
It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the effective tax rate will be impacted by the resolution of some or all of the matters audited by various taxing authorities. It is also reasonably possible that we will have the statute of limitations close in various taxing jurisdictions within the next 12 months. As such, we estimate we could record a reduction in our tax expense of between
$14.3 million
and
$26.9 million
within the next 12 months.
We are principally engaged in the worldwide design, manufacture, distribution and service of industrial flow management equipment. We provide long lead-time, highly engineered pumps, shorter lead-time engineered pumps, standardized, general purpose pumps, mechanical seals, industrial valves and related automation products and solutions primarily for oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management and other general industries requiring flow management products and services.
Our business segments, defined below, share a focus on industrial flow control technology and have a high number of common customers. These segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications that provide us a net competitive advantage. Our segments also benefit from our global footprint and our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively.
We conduct our operations through these three business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business:
For decision-making purposes, our CEO and other members of senior executive management use financial information generated and reported at the reportable segment level. Our corporate headquarters does not constitute a separate division or business segment. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each reportable segments operating income.
12
Amounts classified as "Eliminations and All Other" include corporate headquarters costs and other minor entities that do not constitute separate segments. Intersegment sales and transfers are recorded at cost plus a profit margin, with the sales and related margin on such sales eliminated in consolidation.
The following is a summary of the financial information of the reportable segments reconciled to the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements:
EPD's operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2012, included a
$10.4 million
gain from the sale of a manufacturing facility in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in preparation for opening a new manufacturing facility there later in 2012.
We may, from time to time, offer debt securities that are fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed by certain of our 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. In accordance with Rule 310 of Regulation SX promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, the following condensed consolidating financial statements present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Flowserve Corporation (referred to as Parent for the purpose of this note only) on a Parentonly (Issuer) basis, the combined guarantor subsidiaries on a guarantoronly basis, the combined non-guarantor subsidiaries on a non-guarantor-only basis and elimination adjustments necessary to arrive at the information for the Parent, guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Investments in subsidiaries have been accounted for using the equity method for this presentation.
The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the statements of income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the balance sheets as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and the statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 for the Parent, guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries and elimination adjustments.
