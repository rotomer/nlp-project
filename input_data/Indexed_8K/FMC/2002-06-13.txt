Exhibit 99.1 Immediately INVESTOR RELATIONS: Eric Norris (215) 299-6538 MEDIA: Jeff Jacoby (215) 299-5896 FMC Surprised and Disappointed by Moody's Action PHILADELPHIA - June 13, 2002 - FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) responded today to the downgrade by Moody's Investors Service of FMC's credit ratings of its indebtedness from Baa3/Prime-3 to Ba1/Not-Prime in an announcement made earlier today. Moody's announcement follows last week's action by Standard and Poor's Rating Services (S&P) in which it reaffirmed its investment-grade credit rating and stable outlook for FMC. Chairman, President and CEO William G. Walter said: "While we are gratified by S&P's action to maintain FMC's investment-grade rating, we are extremely disappointed by Moody's action, which we believe reflects its lack of understanding of the strong fundamentals of FMC's businesses and industry dynamics. Further, although we had no assurances, based upon our discussions with Moody's, we were led to believe that they would view an equity offering by FMC coupled with a refinancing of our debt later this year as sufficient to maintain our investment-grade rating. Clearly Moody's outlook for the economy and the chemical industry is much more negative than ours and the views of many others. The action by Moody's before we had the opportunity to take the next steps in our refinancing plan is surprising. Despite Moody's action, we are confident that FMC has adequate liquidity to support all our business operations and to complete our refinancing before upcoming maturities come due near year- end."
