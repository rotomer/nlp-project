Dated: October 7, 2002 Exhibit 99.1 FMC Corporation Announces Improved Outlook for Third Quarter Earnings PHILADELPHIA, October 7, 2002 -- FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) announced today that earnings for the third quarter are expected to be approximately 78 cents per share, 5 cents higher than the current consensus estimate in First Call, due to stronger than expected sales in Agricultural Products and lower overhead costs in both Agricultural Products and Industrial Chemicals. According to William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer: "Our Agricultural Products segment has enjoyed strong sales in the quarter driven by high insect infestation levels in North America, growth in new labels for some of our proprietary chemistries and a shift in demand from the second quarter. Furthermore, cost reduction programs in both the Agricultural Products and Industrial Chemicals segments are yielding significant improvements to our operating margins. While our outlook on broad economic recovery is still very cautious, I am optimistic about the improvements we continue to make in our businesses." FMC will release third quarter earnings after the close of the market on October 29th, 2002, and hold a conference call at 11AM EST on October 30th, which will be available via webcast at ir.fmc.com.
