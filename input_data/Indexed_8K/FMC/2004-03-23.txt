2003 Was On Plan
Despite challenges in Industrial Chemicals
We met our earnings expectations
Astaris commenced a significant restructuring
We exceeded our debt reduction expectations
13
 
Strategic Objectives
Unlocking value and creating a faster growing FMC
Realize the operating leverage inherent within FMC
 Double-digit growth in earnings before restructuring and other charges
 Industrial Chemicals recovery to add earnings of over $1 per share
Create greater financial flexibility
 Net debt reduction of $300 million by 2006
 Regaining an investment grade credit rating
Focus the portfolio on higher growth businesses
 Manage Specialty Chemicals and Agricultural Products for growth
 Manage Industrial Chemicals for cash
 Divest any business that cannot sustain our cost of capital
 Improve ROIC to 12 percent minimum by 2006

Undervalued Compared to Peers
Even with the recent, significant recovery in our stock, we are valued at the lower end of our peer group

Why is FMC Undervalued?
There are still some perceived risks
Successful completion of Astaris restructuring
Chinese impact on soda ash export prices
Timing of price recovery in North American soda ash and hydrogen peroxide businesses
Sustainability of Agricultural Products earnings
Legacy drains on free cash flow generation
17
 
Astaris Restructuring Is On Plan
Significant restructuring at Astaris:
 Plant closures and product line transitions on schedule
 Annualized savings of $40-50 million on track ($20-25 million for FMC)
 Substantial improvement in operating profit expected by Q3 04
North American market dynamics are improving:
 Astaris capacity reductions have tightened domestic supply
 Strong euro has reduced import pressures from Europe
 Chinese P4 supply has greatly subsided due to energy constraints
 Broad-based price increases of 4-7 percent have been announced
De-leveraging and refinancing Astaris:
 Expectation of $40 million in 2004 keepwells, paid entirely in 1H 04, after which Astaris is expected to be debt free
 Possible refinancing of Astaris in late 2004 or early 2005
18
 
Chinese Impact On Soda Ash Export Prices
We expect the impact of excess Chinese capacity to be short-lived
Growth of the Chinese soda ash market:
 Demand of 11 million metric tons growing about 8-10 percent per year
 Excess supply of 2 million metric tons can be readily absorbed
Domestic Chinese pricing is at or below many producers' costs:
 There are 47 soda ash producers, the majority of which are small
 With current market pricing of 900 RMB, many may have to shut down
Cost escalation is exacerbating the situation for the Chinese:
 Salt, a key ingredient in synthetic production, is in short supply
 Energy costs, particularly coal, have escalated substantially
 VAT drawback for exported soda ash has decreased
 Ocean freight for soda ash exports has risen significantly
19
 
Sustainability of Agricultural Products Earnings
Improving global farm economy:
 Rising global crop prices
 Improving U.S. farm income
 Increasing global competitiveness of Brazilian farmers
Significant cost savings from productivity initiatives:
 Manufacturing outsourcing strategies continue to produce savings
 Global supply chain redesign under evaluation
 Network of global partnerships provides low-cost marketing scale
Focused, successful innovation:
 Label expansions in both crop and specialty markets
 Novel ISK chemistry targeting sucking pests to launch 2005
 Discovery efforts have resulted in many promising chemistries, several of which are now entering global field trials
