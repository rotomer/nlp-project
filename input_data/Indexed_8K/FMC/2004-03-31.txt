Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FMC Updates First Quarter 2004 Outlook
 
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today said that it expects first quarter 2004 earnings per share before restructuring and other charges to significantly exceed $0.17 per share, the top end of analysts' current estimates. The driver for this revised outlook is substantially stronger-than-expected performance during the quarter in Agricultural Products, particularly in Brazil. The strength in Brazil is the result of a robust agricultural economy and higher pest pressures. The company's outlook for Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals for the quarter is unchanged from previous guidance.
