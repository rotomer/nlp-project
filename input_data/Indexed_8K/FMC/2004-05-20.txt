Use of Non-GAAP Terms
These slides contain certain "non-GAAP financial terms" which are defined on FMC's Investor Relations web site (http://ir.fmc.com) in the Glossary of Financial Terms section. In addition, in the Conference Calls and Presentations section, we have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP terms to the closest GAAP term.
Following is a list of some of these non-GAAP terms:
Adjusted EBITDA (Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) is the sum of Income from continuing operations before equity earnings in affiliates, minority interests, interest income and expense, income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and Depreciation and Amortization less Restructuring and other charges (gains).
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is the quotient of Adjusted EBITDA (defined above) and Revenue.
Segment EBITDA is the sum of Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and Depreciation and Amortization for a segment.
Segment EBITDA Margin is the quotient of EBITDA (defined above) and Revenue for a segment.
ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) is the sum of Earnings from continuing operations before restructuring and other charges (gains) and after-tax Interest expense divided by the sum of Short-term debt, Current portion of long-term debt, Long-term debt and Total shareholders' equity.

Stabilizing Export Soda Ash Market
We expect the impact of excess Chinese capacity to be short-lived
Growth of the Chinese soda ash market:
Demand of 11 million metric tons growing about 8-10 percent per year Excess supply of 2 million metric tons can be readily absorbed
Domestic Chinese pricing is at or below many producers' costs:
There are 47 soda ash producers, the majority of which are small With market pricing near RMB 900, many may have to shut down
Higher costs are limiting Chinese soda ash production:
Salt, a key ingredient in synthetic production, is in short supply Energy costs, particularly coal, have escalated substantially VAT drawback for exported soda ash has decreased Ocean freight for soda ash exports has risen significantly

Rising Domestic Hydrogen Peroxide Prices
Higher capacity utilization is driving higher prices, even though the North America pulp industry recovery has been sluggish

Industrial Chemicals Improvement in Europe
Steady recovery across nearly all of Foret's product lines
After a strong 2003, peroxygens expected to continue to grow:
Hydrogen peroxide demand growth of 4% per year driven by strength of Scandinavian pulp industry Peroxide price increase of 8% in 2003; another 5% expected during 2004
Phosphorus chemicals in a slow recovery driven by capacity reduction:
Rhodia's shutdown of Rhouen STPP facility has improved industry capacity utilization Foret has recovered STPP volume that was lost in 2002 Price recovery is beginning
10
 
Turnaround In Domestic Phosphorus
Significant restructuring at Astaris:
Plant closures and product line transitions on schedule
Annualized savings of $40-50 million on track ($20-25 million for FMC) Substantial improvement in operating profit expected in 2004
North American market dynamics are improving:
Astaris capacity reductions have tightened domestic supply Strong euro has reduced import pressures from Europe
Chinese P4 supply has greatly subsided due to energy constraints
Broad-based price increases of 4-7 percent have been announced
De-leveraging and refinancing Astaris:
Expectation of $40 million in 2004 keepwells, paid entirely in 1H 04, after which Astaris is expected to be debt free Possible refinancing of Astaris in late 2004 or early 2005
