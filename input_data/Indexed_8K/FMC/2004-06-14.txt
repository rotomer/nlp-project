APG R&D Overview  Focused Insecticide Innovation
Consistently invests 10-12% of sales on R&D innovation
Recently completed external evaluation puts our APG's Insecticide discovery program as among the most competitive in the industry
Sustainable long-term growth enabled by robust pipeline; we have >20 chemistry areas with activity between 0.1-100 ppm
We have the potential to commercialize 2-4 new active ingredients (ai's) in next ~10 years
We have three new ai's (molecules) that we've accessed externally
We have created a novel development approach that should reduce total spending by millions of $'s, and reduce time to market by years
State-of-the-art technologies are leveraged by world class scientists
New technologies allow a sustainable HTS (high throughput screening) program for whole insects and complex biochemical insect targets
Investment in genomics technologies created a unique asset, enabling previously unattainable understanding of gene targets & new ai MOAs

Insecticide Market is Projected to Grow Slightly over the Next 10 Years1
R&D Focused On These Market Segments
Piercing-sucking pests ($2.4B)
Increasingly important due to decreased use of broad-spectrum insecticides
Resistance due to multiple applications
Chewing pests ($3.1B)
Market crowded, dominated by organophosphates (which are under significant regulatory pressure) and pyrethroids
Portfolios with different MOAs needed for resistance management
?Mite pest segment ($0.7B)
High resistance, thus shorter product life cycles
Need activity in other pest segments to add value to a new acaricide
Nematode pest segment ($0.5B)
Unmet need for new products
Ease of use and safety are key

Agricultural Products Group
The Market  Implications & Conclusions
Increasing populations, changing dietary habits of majority of the world's population, restricted growth of arable land are likely to drive need for increased agricultural productivity;
Older products likely to decline due to resistance and regulatory pressures at the expense of newer, safer products;
New chemistries with different Mechanism of Action (MOA) needed and valued for resistance management;
The insecticide market potential likely to be in replacement markets and new uses that include unique pest or product combinations;
GMOs remain a limited threat to high-value crop and specialty markets:
Prophylactic treatments on row crops the main target of GMO input traits, and majority of the impact on row crops has already occurred;
New opportunities will arise as pest spectrums shift due to GMO, and we move to protecting crops with valuable output traits;
APG's key focus areas are global high-value crops and non-crop Specialty markets

Completed 17 residue/metabolism studies in <12 months (normally takes18-24 months) for IR-4 submission; will result expanding label by 630 crops
Consistent support for all core products, including label expansions, product defense, new formulations (e.g., completed 15 Risk Assessments in <1 year for label expansions/product registration) New Non-Crop Specialty uses for our core products: Created a novel Development approach:
Should reduce total spending by millions of $'s
Should reduce time to market by years
Uses early data development, use of low cost labs and maintaining in-house, core competencies

Recent External Assessment of FMC's Discovery Program, Science and Talent Strongly Positive
"The FMC APG Discovery organization clearly has the talent, structure and leadership to be a significant player in the arena of proprietary insecticide chemistry.
"This organization's current and emerging patent portfolio (i.e., discoveries) is replete with diverse chemical scaffolds demonstrating a rich array of physical and biological properties, with significant potential for both near- and long-term commercial utility.
"The FMC APG R&D organization promotes individual and team empowerment, leadership, entrepreneur-mentality, ingenuity and interdisciplinary approaches to solving problems and making successes. Such facets give this FMC organization a unique nimbleness, allowing for timely and accurate decisions, and subsequently, actions  the efficiency of the APG Discovery organization could indeed allow FMC to successfully compete with its larger commercial rivals"
10 June 2004 43
 
Agricultural Products Group
In Summary
Our pipeline is full and sustainable, from early stage leads to pre-development; recently validated by an external expert In 2004, we are conducting:
 150 full-scale global field trials on 2 new products from two different areas of chemistry;
 100 small plot pilot trials on 3-4 compounds, all from different chemistries;
 >50 early translation trials on 6-8 different areas of chemistry
Based on the progress we have made in discovering novel new insecticides and the extent of our current pipeline, we believe that our continued efforts should result in the commercialization of 2-4 novel insecticides over the next ~10 years We have created a new product Development strategy that can potentially reduce development costs by millions of dollars and time to commercialization by years
