Defining Characteristics of the Soda Ash Industry
Commodity
Cyclical
Large Concentrated Customers
Growth Export Driven
High Fixed Costs
Relatively Flat Supply Curve
Hallmarks of Profitable Industries With Similar Characteristics
Supply/demand can be influenced to allow profitable operating rates
underlying volume growth and/or
closure of uneconomic capacity
"Market share = Capacity Share" describes long term historical pattern
Goal: Pricing reflects hurdle rate returns across the cycle
