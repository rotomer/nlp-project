Improving Soda Ash Export Market
Chinese have curbed expansions and begun to increase prices
Growth of the Chinese soda ash market
Demand of 11 million metric tons growing about 8-10 percent per year
Excess supply of 2 million metric tons is being readily absorbed
Domestic Chinese pricing is at or below many producers' costs
There are 47 soda ash producers, the majority of which are small
With market pricing near the cost of less efficient producers, some have shut down; others have postponed capacity increases
Higher costs are limiting Chinese soda ash production
Salt, a key ingredient in synthetic production, is in short supply
Energy costs, particularly coke, have escalated substantially
The VAT drawback for exported soda ash has decreased
Ocean freight for soda ash exports has risen significantly
Chinese exporters recently raised price by $10/metric ton

Industrial Chemicals Improvement in Europe
Steady recovery across nearly all of Foret's product lines
After a strong 2003, peroxygens expected to continue to grow
Hydrogen peroxide demand growth of 4% per year driven by strength of Scandinavian pulp industry
Peroxide price increase of 8% in 2003; another 5% expected during 2004
Phosphorus chemicals in a slow recovery driven by capacity reduction
Rhodia's shutdown of Rouen STPP facility has improved industry capacity utilization
Foret has recovered STPP volume that was lost in 2002
Price recovery is beginning
 
Turnaround In Domestic Phosphorus
Significant restructuring at Astaris
Plant closures and product line transitions are completed
Annualized savings of $40 million are in place (a $20 million benefit to FMC's operating profit)
North American market dynamics are improving
Astaris capacity reductions have tightened domestic supply
Strong euro has reduced import pressures from Europe
Chinese P4 supply has greatly subsided due to energy constraints
Broad-based price increases of 4-7 percent are expected to have favorable impact on 2005 contracts
De-leveraging and refinancing Astaris
$36 million of keepwells paid during Q2 2004
Astaris is now debt free
Possible refinancing of Astaris in late 2004 or early 2005
