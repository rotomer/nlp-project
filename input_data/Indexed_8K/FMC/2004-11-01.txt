Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
FMC Corporation (the "Company") executed an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 29, 2004, among the Company and the Foreign Subsidiaries Party Thereto From Time to Time, the Lenders and Issuers Party Thereto, Citicorp USA, Inc., as Administrative Agent, Wachovia Bank, National Association, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and National City Bank, as Co-Documentation Agents, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Societe General, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and DnB NOR Bank ASA, as Co-Agents, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and Wachovia Securities, Inc., as Co-Lead Arrangers and Co-Book Managers (the "2004 Credit Agreement"). The 2004 Credit Agreement amends and restates FMC's existing Credit Agreement, dated October 21, 2002, and replaces FMC's $40,000,000 Letter of Credit Agreement, dated as of October 21, 2002 (the "Letter of Credit Agreement"), which has been terminated.
 
The 2004 Credit Agreement provides for a $400 million revolving credit facility ($150 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the Company), a $100 million term loan and a $100 million stand-alone letter of credit facility (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"). The term loan under the existing Credit Agreement, in the amount of $241.7 million, was repaid.
 
Under the 2004 Credit Agreement, $2.5 million of the term loan will be due and payable at the end of each quarter, commencing March 31, 2005, with the balance maturing on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the 2004 Credit Agreement. Amounts under the $400 million revolving credit facility may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until the maturity of the revolving credit facility on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the 2004 Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions under the Credit Facilities are permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to minimum dollar amounts.
 
Obligations under the 2004 Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which will be, at our option, either a base rate or a London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), in each case plus an applicable margin. The base rate will be Citibank N.A.'s base rate. The initial applicable margin over LIBOR for the term loan and borrowings under the revolving credit facility is 1.00%. The applicable margins under our revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to the Credit Facilities by each of Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services.
 
Under the 2004 Credit Agreement, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the difference between the total amount of the revolving credit facility and the amount borrowed by us. The initial commitment fee is 0.25% per year. The commitment fee is subject to adjustment based on the ratings assigned to the Credit Facilities. We will also pay fees with respect to the base amount of letters of credit issued for our account at a rate per year equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR loans under the revolving credit facility under the 2004 Credit Agreement, plus a 0.15% issuance fee.
 
The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Credit Facilities or the security provided in connection therewith, and reference is made to the complete text of the governing document, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
Some of the lenders under the Credit Facilities and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, trust and leasing services. In addition, the Company has entered into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative arrangements with some of the lenders and their affiliates.
 
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
The disclosure required by this item with respect to the termination of the Letter of Credit Agreement is included in Item 1.01 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation of a Registrant.

This opinion is rendered to you pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(vi)(A) of the Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms which are defined in the Credit Agreement and used herein, but not otherwise defined herein, have the meanings given them in the Credit Agreement.
 
In connection with the opinions expressed below, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of the following documents:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The agreements specified in clauses (a) through (m) above are collectively referred to as the "" and the agreements specified in clauses (a) through (k) above are collectively referred to as the "."

New York Agreements
 
We have also examined such corporate records, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Loan Parties, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth. As to questions of fact material to our opinions, we have relied without independent investigation upon the representations of the Loan Parties contained in or made pursuant to the Agreements.
 
In our examination of the above-mentioned documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
We have further assumed that each of the Agreements has been duly and validly executed and delivered by all of the parties thereto other than the Loan Parties and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of all parties thereto other than the Loan Parties.
 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1. Each of the U.S. Borrower, the Delaware Loan Party Corporations and the Delaware Loan Party Limited Liability Companies (as defined in ) is a corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, to own, lease and operate its properties and to transact the business in which we understand it is now engaged.

2. Each of the Wyoming Loan Party Corporations and the Wyoming Loan Party Limited Liability Companies (as defined in ) is a corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Wyoming and has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, to own, lease and operate its properties and to transact the business in which we understand it is now engaged.
Schedule I
 
3. Each Loan Party has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Agreements to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of the Agreements to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company action, as applicable, on the part of such Loan Party and such Agreements have been duly executed and delivered by such Loan Party.
 
4. Each New York Agreement to which a Loan Party is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of such Loan Party, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms.
 
5. The execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of the Agreements to which it is a party will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any provisions of the Constituent Documents of such Loan Party, (ii) any provisions of the Indenture or the indentures governing the Existing Public Debt, (iii) to our knowledge any other material Contractual Obligation of such Loan Party, (iv) the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the laws of the State of New York, the State of Wyoming, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States, which are applicable to such Loan Party and are, in our experience, normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Agreements, or (v) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or Governmental Authority applicable to such Loan Party and of which we have knowledge.
 
6. No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with any New York, Wyoming, Pennsylvania or federal Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by any Loan Party of the Agreements to which it is a party other than (i) the recordings and filings made in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement and (ii) the recording of the amendments to the Mortgages contemplated by the Credit Agreement in the offices where the Mortgages were recorded.
 
7. The borrowings by and other financial accommodations provided to the U.S. Borrower under the Agreements and the application of proceeds thereof as provided in the Credit Agreement will not violate Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
 
8. Neither the U.S. Borrower nor any other Loan Party is an "" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or a "" or a "" of a "" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

9. To our knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding, governmental investigation or arbitration, at law or in equity or before any Governmental Authority, pending or overtly threatened in writing against any Loan Party with respect to any Agreement or challenging any of the Lenders', the Issuers' or the Administrative Agent's rights or remedies thereunder, which, if adversely determined, could materially adversely affect the ability of any Loan Party to perform its obligations under the Agreements to which it is a party.
 
10. All of the outstanding shares of the Pledged Stock (as defined in the Bank Security Agreement) of each Domestic Subsidiary that is a corporation (each an "") are (i) owned of record and, to our knowledge, beneficially by the U.S. Borrower, free and clear of all adverse claims and (ii) to our knowledge were not issued in violation of any preemptive rights granted by the Constituent Documents of such Issuing Subsidiary. There are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, rights, commitments or other instruments or agreements of any character of which we have knowledge obligating the U.S. Borrower or any other Loan Party to sell or any Issuing Subsidiary to issue any shares of Stock of any Issuing Subsidiary or any securities convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase or subscribe for any shares of such Stock, and there are no agreements or understandings of which we have knowledge with respect to the voting, sale or transfer of any shares of the Stock of such Issuing Subsidiary.

The Bank Security Agreement creates in favor of the Administrative Agent, as security for each Loan Party's Secured Obligations, a valid security interest in all of the right, title and interest of such Loan Party in the Collateral described therein in which a security interest may be created under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York (the ""). Assuming that the applicable Financing Statements were properly filed

in the proper filing offices in the jurisdictions identified in Schedule II hereto, such security interest is perfected to the extent perfection of a security interest in such Collateral may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in each jurisdiction set forth in Schedule II.
 
The Shared Collateral Security Agreement creates in favor of the Collateral Trustee for the Secured Parties (as defined therein), as security for the Secured Obligations (as defined therein), a valid security interest in all right, title and interest of each Grantor that is a signatory to such Agreement in the Shared Collateral described therein in which a security interest may be created under Article 9 of the New York UCC. Assuming that the applicable Financing Statements were properly filed in the proper filing offices in the jurisdictions identified in Schedule II hereto, such security interest is perfected to the extent perfection of a security interest in such Shared Collateral may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in each jurisdiction set forth in Schedule II.
 
The Deposit Account Control Agreements are effective to perfect the security interest created by the Bank Security Agreements in such of the Collateral as constitutes "deposit accounts" as defined in the New York UCC.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FMC Corporation Executes $600 Million Credit Agreement
 
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today announced that on October 29, 2004, it executed an amendment of its credit agreement increasing commitments to $600 million. The five-year agreement provides for a $400 million revolving credit facility, a $100 million term loan and a $100 million stand-alone letter of credit facility.
PHILADELPHIA, November 1, 2004
 
In addition to the expanded size, the new credit agreement incorporates improved pricing, terms and conditions reflecting the Company's significantly improved credit profile. The Company expects to achieve significant savings from the approximately $140 million reduction in its term loan borrowings, the elimination of its restricted cash balances and savings from lower interest rate margins under its new credit agreement.
 
FMC Corporation is a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, industrial and consumer markets globally for more than a century with innovative solutions, applications and quality products. The company employs approximately 5,300 people throughout the world. The company operates its businesses in three segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals.
 
Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Act of 1995: Statements in this news release that are forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors described in FMC Corporation's 2003 Form 10-K and other SEC filings. Such information contained herein represents management's best judgment as of the date hereof based on information currently available. FMC Corporation does not intend to update this information and disclaims any legal obligation to the contrary. Historical information is not necessarily indicative of future performance.
