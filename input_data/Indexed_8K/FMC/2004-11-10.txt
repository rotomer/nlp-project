Turnaround In Phosphorus Chemicals
Domestic improvement resulting from Astaris restructuring
Annualized savings of $40 million are in place (a $20 million benefit to FMC's operating profit)
Astaris capacity reductions have tightened domestic supply
Price increases of 4-7 percent are expected for 2005, which will be partially offset by higher input costs
Sold-out European STPP market
Driven by capacity closures and decreased Chinese imports
Prices at Foret have risen over 10 percent versus the prior year
Astaris deleveraging to impact cash flow favorably
Astaris is debt free, and keepwell payments are no longer anticipated
Refinancing of Astaris in late 2004 or 2005
Possible dividend of cash back to FMC post an Astaris refinancing
