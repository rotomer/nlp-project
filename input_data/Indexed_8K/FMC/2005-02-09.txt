ITEM 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
In response to inquiries, FMC Corporation ("FMC") confirmed today that on January 28, 2005, it received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1994 to 2001. A number of other companies also received the Statement of Objections. FMC also confirmed that it received a subpoena for documents from a grand jury sitting in the Northern District of California, which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the United States during the period 1994 through 2003. At this time, FMC does not believe the investigations are related and intends to defend vigorously its position with both enforcement agencies.
