Soda Ash Demand Overview
2004 global demand ~ 43.2M Tons
China is the largest market consuming ~ 12.4M Short Tons
Worldwide growth of ~ 2-3% per year primarily in developing regions
Glass represents largest end use sector; ~ 50% of total demand
Two production routes: natural and synthetic
Low cost position has made the US largest export player ~ 5.2M Tons

American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (ANSAC)
Export sales/marketing logistics corporation
Limited exemption from Sherman Anti-trust law for the purpose of export sales
ANSAC exports ~ 1/3 of US productionf

Industry Events Have Reset The Global Environment
Financial
Weaker US dollar
Cost
Ocean freight rates have increased dramatically from historic levels
Synthetic producers impacted by higher coke prices
China is experiencing a salt shortage resulting in significant cost pressure
for Chinese soda ash producers
Capacity
OCI shutdown Incheon, Korea facility in Q1 2004
Solvay shutdown of Colorado soda ash operation in Q3 2004
Solvay announced shutdown of Austrian facility in 2005
China supply / demand remains in balance
FMC announced restart of 250K tons of Granger capacity
10
 
Upward Momentum for Export Pricing Continues
European producers worldwide facing higher costs due to coke availability
Chinese producers under additional cost pressure(s) due to salt, coal, power and VAT duty drawback reductions China supply/demand will remain in balance
Chinese domestic price has doubled in the last year
Higher ocean transport and energy costs need to be recovered
U.S. dollar relatively weak
Strong GDP growth in Asia and Latin America
Functional substitution occurs as caustic soda price increases

Growth 8.4% 11.4% 8%
Exports 1,378 1,574 1,600
Imports 298 210 170
China will remain balanced as growth absorbs planned capacity additions Chinese efforts (credit / VAT) to restrain growth have delayed future expansions US competitive position bolstered by:
Higher raw material costs (salt, coal, electricity, transportation) VAT duty drawback reduction
RMB revaluation remains a possibility

Domestic
All grades of soda ash
Off-list prices +$30/ton (by end of contract season)
List prices raised + $20/ton
Significant progress made revising terms to protect future margins ( e.g, energy, freight)
Most successful contract season in more than a decade
Limited by competitive price restrictions from previous periods and/or timing
ANSAC
Added an Asian fuel surcharge effective August 2004 loadings
Increased Asian pricing to ~$ 200/ short ton (+ $40  60/ short ton) effective January 2005
Offset by rising ocean freight costs Awaiting China's competitive response
