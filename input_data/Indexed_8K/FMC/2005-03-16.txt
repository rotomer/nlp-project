Industry Events Have Reset The Global Environment
Financial
Weaker US dollar
Cost
Ocean freight rates have increased dramatically from historic levels
Synthetic producers impacted by higher coke prices
China is experiencing a salt shortage resulting in significant cost pressure for Chinese soda ash producers
Capacity
OCI shutdown Incheon, Korea facility in Q1 2004
Solvay shutdown of Colorado soda ash operation in Q3 2004
Solvay announced shutdown of Austrian facility in 2005
China supply / demand remains in balance
FMC announced restart of 250K tons of Granger capacity

List prices raised + $20/ton
Significant progress made revising terms to protect future margins ( e.g, energy, freight)
Most successful contract season in more than a decade
Limited by competitive price restrictions from previous periods and/or timing
ANSAC
Added an Asian fuel surcharge effective August 2004 loadings
Increased Asian pricing to ~$ 200/ short ton (+ $40  60/ short ton) effective January 2005
Offset by rising ocean freight costs
Awaiting China's competitive response
Europe
All producers have announced increases 15-20 euro per ton range
 
Soda Ash Summary
U.S. industry operating at full effective capacity
7% growth in U.S. export demand in 2004
History shows operating rate is a leading indicator for price
Financial pressure worldwide has lead to a rising price environment
Raw material and energy costs
Freight (rail and/or ocean)
Chinese governmental influence (e.g. credit, VAT duty drawback)
Global utilization  the world is sold out
FMC is positioned for higher soda ash profitability

Incremental capacity options exist at FMC Granger
 
Hydrogen Peroxide Overview
North American demand for hydrogen peroxide was 1.45 billion lbs. in 2004
Hydrogen gas is the primary raw material
Energy and hydrogen gas represent 50% of the cost of sales
Hydrogen peroxide is shipped dilute in water, resulting in a fairly regional market with few imports or exports
Pulp and paper is the largest end-market
Specialty peroxide derivatives are used in numerous high value applications including electronics, polymers and detergents
