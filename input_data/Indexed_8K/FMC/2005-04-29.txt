ITEM 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
 
On April 26, 2005, FMC Corporation ("FMC" or "the Company") made the decision to close its Copenhagen, Denmark, carrageenan plant and a blending facility in Bezons, France. High costs at the Copenhagen plant coupled with reduced demand for the specific extract types manufactured at that site have made it uneconomical for FMC to continue operation. FMC will consolidate production and supply carrageenan from other FMC facilities around the world.
 
The Company expects the closures will result in an estimated pre-tax charge to earnings of approximately $30 million over the second and third quarters of 2005. Estimates of the total cost the Company expects to incur for each major type of cost associated with the closures are: (i) accelerated depreciation of plant and equipment of $23 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of approximately $3 million, and (iii) $4 million of other costs. Net cash outlays related to the closures are expected to be approximately $5 million.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
