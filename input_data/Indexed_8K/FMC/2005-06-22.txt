Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
FMC Corporation (the "Company") executed a Credit Agreement, dated as of June 21, 2005, among the Company and the Foreign Subsidiaries Party Thereto From Time to Time, the Lenders and Issuers Party Thereto, Citicorp USA, Inc., as Administrative Agent, Wachovia Bank, National Association and ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as Co-Documentation Agents, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, National City Bank, Societe Generale, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and DnB NOR Bank ASA, as Co-Agents, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and Wachovia Securities, Inc., as Co-Lead Arrangers and Co-Book Managers (the "2005 Credit Agreement").
 
The 2005 Credit Agreement provides for a $600 million revolving credit facility ($250 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the Company) and a $250 million term loan facility (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"). The Credit Facilities are unsecured obligations which rank with all other unsecured senior indebtedness of the Company.
pari passu
 
The proceeds of the Credit Facilities are being used to refinance obligations under the Company's secured credit agreement dated as of October 29, 2004 (the "2004 Credit Agreement"), which is being terminated, to redeem all of the Company's $355 million aggregate principal amount of 10.25% Senior Secured Notes Due 2009 (the "Notes") pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 21, 2002, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, as subsidiary guarantors, and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Indenture"); to pay any related transaction costs, fees and expenses; and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
 
Under the 2005 Credit Agreement the term loan can be drawn up to two times during 60 days following the closing date of the 2005 Credit Agreement, and $6.25 million of the term loan will be due and payable at the end of each quarter, commencing September 30, 2005, with the balance maturing on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the 2005 Credit Agreement. Amounts under the $600 million revolving credit facility may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until the maturity of the revolving credit facility on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the 2005 Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions under the Credit Facilities are permitted at any time without payment of any prepayment fee upon proper notice and subject to minimum dollar amounts.
 
Loans under the 2005 Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which will be, at the Company's option, either a base rate or a London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), in each case plus a margin, if applicable. The base rate will be Citibank N.A.'s base rate. The initial applicable margin for the term loan and borrowings under the revolving credit facility is 0.75% per annum over LIBOR. There is no margin initially applicable to base rate loans. The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to the Credit Facilities by each of Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services.
 
Under the 2005 Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the difference between the total amount of the revolving credit facility or the term loan facility, as applicable, and the amount borrowed or otherwise utilized by the Company. The initial commitment fee is 0.150% per year. The commitment fee is subject to adjustment based on the ratings assigned to the Credit Facilities. The Company will also pay fees with respect to the base amount of letters of credit issued for its account at a rate per year equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR loans under the revolving credit facility, plus a 0.150% issuance fee.
 
The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Credit Facilities and reference is made to the complete text of the governing document, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
Some of the lenders under the Credit Facilities and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, trust and leasing services. In addition, the Company has entered into interest rate, foreign exchange and energy derivative arrangements with some of the lenders and their affiliates.
 
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
The Company has called for the redemption on July 21, 2005 all of the Notes pursuant to a notice of redemption which was mailed on June 21, 2005. The Notes will be redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture at the redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and a "make-whole amount" that will be determined approximately three business days prior to the redemption date, in accordance with the Indenture. Any further disclosures required by this item with respect to the termination of the Indenture are included in Item 1.01 and are incorporated herein by reference. Upon the payment of all of the Notes, the Indenture will be terminated.
 
The disclosures required by this item with respect to the termination of the 2004 Credit Agreement are included in Item 1.01 and are incorporated herein by reference.

We have also examined such corporate records, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Loan Parties, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth. As to questions of fact material to our opinions, we have relied without independent investigation upon the representations of the Loan Parties contained in or made pursuant to the Agreements.
 
In our examination of the above-mentioned documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
We have further assumed that each of the Agreements has been duly and validly executed and delivered by all of the parties thereto other than the Loan Parties and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of all parties thereto other than the Loan Parties.
 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1. Each of the U.S. Borrower, the Delaware Loan Party Corporations and the Delaware Loan Party Limited Liability Companies (as defined in ) is a corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, to own, lease and operate its properties and to transact the business in which we understand it is now engaged.

Schedule I
 
3. Each Loan Party has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Agreements to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of the Agreements to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company action, as applicable, on the part of such Loan Party and such Agreements have been duly executed and delivered by such Loan Party.
 
4. Each Agreement to which a Loan Party is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of such Loan Party, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms.
 
5. The execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of the Agreements to which it is a party will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any provisions of the Constituent Documents of such Loan Party, (ii) any provisions of the Indenture or the indentures governing the Existing Public Debt, (iii) to our knowledge any other material

Contractual Obligation of such Loan Party, (iv) the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the laws of the State of New York, the State of Wyoming, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States, which are applicable to such Loan Party and are, in our experience, normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Agreements, or (v) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or Governmental Authority applicable to such Loan Party and of which we have knowledge.
 
6. No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with any New York, Wyoming, Pennsylvania or federal Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by any Loan Party of the Agreements to which it is a party.
 
7. The borrowings by and other financial accommodations provided to the U.S. Borrower under the Agreements and the application of proceeds thereof as provided in the Credit Agreement will not violate Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following additional assumptions and qualifications:
 
 
 
 
The opinions expressed herein are limited to matters governed by the laws of the State of New York, the State of Wyoming, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the federal laws of the United States.

Each Subsidiary Guarantor shall not, until the Guaranteed Obligations are irrevocably paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated, assert any claim or counterclaim it may have against any Borrower or set off any of its obligations to any Borrower against any obligations of any Borrower to it. In connection with the foregoing, each Subsidiary Guarantor covenants that its obligations hereunder shall not be discharged, except by complete performance.
 
Section 7 Reliance
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Borrowers and any endorser and other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, that diligent inquiry would reveal, and each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that no Guarantied Party shall have any duty to advise any Subsidiary Guarantor of information known to it regarding such condition or any such circumstances. In the event any Guarantied Party, in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to any Subsidiary Guarantor, such Guarantied Party shall be under no obligation (a) to undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business routine, (b) to disclose any information that such Guarantied Party, pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance or banking practices, wishes to maintain confidential or (c) to make any other or future disclosures of such information or any other information to any Subsidiary Guarantor.
 
Section 8 Waiver of Subrogation and Contribution Rights
 
Until the Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full and the Commitments under the Loan Documents have been terminated, the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not enforce or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation to any of the rights of the Guarantied Parties or any part of them against any Borrower or any right of reimbursement or contribution or similar right against any Borrower by reason of this Agreement or by any payment made by any Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations.

Section 9 Subordination
 
Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that any Indebtedness of the Borrowers now or hereafter owing to any Subsidiary Guarantor, whether heretofore, now or hereafter created (the ""), is hereby subordinated to all of the Guaranteed Obligations and that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing the Subsidiary Guarantor Subordinated Debt shall not be paid in whole or in part until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full and this Guaranty is terminated and of no further force or effect. No Subsidiary Guarantor shall accept any payment of or on account of any Subsidiary Guarantor Subordinated Debt at any time in contravention of the foregoing. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Subsidiary Guarantor shall pay to the Administrative Agent any payment of all or any part of the Subsidiary Guarantor Subordinated Debt and any amount so paid to the Administrative Agent shall be applied to payment of the Guaranteed Obligations as provided in of the Credit Agreement. Each payment on the Subsidiary Guarantor Subordinated Debt received in violation of any of the provisions hereof shall be deemed to have been received by such Subsidiary Guarantor as trustee for the Guarantied Parties and shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent immediately on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without otherwise affecting in any manner such Subsidiary Guarantor's liability hereof. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees to file all claims against any Borrower in any bankruptcy or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law in respect of any Subsidiary Guarantor Subordinated Debt, and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to all of such Subsidiary Guarantor's rights thereunder. If for any reason a Subsidiary Guarantor fails to file such claim at least ten Business Days prior to the last date on which such claim should be filed, such Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact and is hereby authorized to act as attorney-in-fact in such Subsidiary Guarantor's name to file such claim or, in the Administrative Agent's discretion, to assign such claim to and cause proof of claim to be filed in the name of the Administrative Agent or its nominee. In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the person or persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to the Administrative Agent the full amount payable on the claim in the proceeding, and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby assigns to the Administrative Agent all of such Subsidiary Guarantor's rights to any payments or distributions to which such Subsidiary Guarantor otherwise would be entitled. If the amount so paid is greater than such Subsidiary Guarantor's liability hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay the excess amount to the party entitled thereto. In addition, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its attorney-in-fact to exercise all of such Subsidiary Guarantor's voting rights in connection with any bankruptcy proceeding or any plan for the reorganization of the Borrowers.

If any Obligation is not paid when due, or upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default or upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any default by any Borrower as provided in any other instrument or document evidencing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Administrative Agent may, at its sole election, proceed directly and at once, without notice, against any Subsidiary Guarantor to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations then due, without first proceeding against any Borrower or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, or joining any Borrower or any other guarantor in any proceeding against any Subsidiary Guarantor. At any time after maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Administrative Agent may (unless the Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full), without notice to any Subsidiary Guarantor and regardless of the acceptance of any collateral for the

Section 11 Irrevocability
 
This Guaranty shall be irrevocable as to the Guaranteed Obligations (or any part thereof) until the Commitments under the Loan Documents have been terminated and all monetary Guaranteed Obligations then outstanding have been irrevocably repaid in cash, at which time this Guaranty shall automatically be cancelled. Upon such cancellation and at the written request of any Subsidiary Guarantor or its successors or assigns, and at the cost and expense of such Subsidiary Guarantor or its successors or assigns, the Administrative Agent shall execute in a timely manner a satisfaction of this Guaranty and such instruments, documents or agreements as are necessary or desirable to evidence the termination of this Guaranty.
 
Section 12 Setoff
 
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Guarantied Party and each Affiliate of a Guarantied Party may, without notice to any Subsidiary Guarantor and regardless of the acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and apply toward the payment of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (a) any indebtedness due or to become due from such Guarantied Party or Affiliate to such Subsidiary Guarantor and (b) any moneys, credits or other property belonging to such Subsidiary Guarantor, at any time held by, or coming into, the possession of such Guarantied Party or Affiliate.

No modification or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty shall be binding upon any Guarantied Party, except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed and delivered by the party making such modification or waiver.

FMC Corporation  News Release
 
 
FMC Corporation Executes $850 Million Credit Agreement and Calls its 10.25 Percent Senior Secured Notes for Redemption
 
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) announced today that it has executed a new unsecured credit agreement with a group of lenders providing for extensions of credit in the aggregate amount of $850 million. The new five-year credit agreement provides for a $600 million revolving credit facility ($250 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit) and a $250 million term loan. The new credit agreement replaces a $600 million secured credit agreement entered into in October 2004. In addition to the new credit agreement being unsecured, it provides more favorable pricing and greater financial flexibility than the previous credit agreement.
PHILADELPHIA, June 21, 2005
 
The Company also announced today that it has called for redemption on July 21, 2005, all of its 10.25 percent Senior Secured Notes Due 2009 (the "Notes") outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $355 million. The redemption price of the Notes will be 100 percent of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date and a "make-whole" premium that will be determined prior to the redemption date, in accordance with the indenture governing the Notes.
 
During the second and third quarters of 2005, the Company will record losses on debt extinguishments of approximately $2 million and $56 million, respectively, reflecting the write-off of unamortized financing costs and the estimated $45 million premium payable upon redemption of the Notes.
 
Page 2/FMC Corporation Executes $850 Million Credit Agreement and Calls its 10.25 Percent Senior Secured Notes for Redemption
 
As a result of lower interest expense related to the new credit agreement and the redemption of the Notes, the Company now expects full-year earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to be on the higher end of the previously guided range of $4.15-4.30 per diluted share. The balance of the Company's outlook provided on May 3, 2005 remains unchanged.
