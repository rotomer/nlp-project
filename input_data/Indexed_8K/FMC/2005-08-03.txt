FMC Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2005 Results
 
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported second quarter 2005 net income of $31.2 million or $0.80 per diluted share as compared with $30.7 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2004. The company recorded restructuring and other income and charges in the quarter of $21.6 million after-tax or $0.55 per diluted share versus $11.9 million after-tax or $0.32 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Excluding these charges, the company earned $1.35 per diluted share in the second quarter 2005, an increase of 18 percent versus $1.14 per diluted share in the second quarter 2004. Second quarter revenue of $565.6 million increased 6 percent versus $534.3 million in the prior year quarter.
PHILADELPHIA, August 2, 2005
 
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: "FMC continues to perform at a high level. We once again delivered a strong quarter and are on track to achieve the goals we have set for the company. Industrial Chemicals was the largest driver of our profit growth in the quarter with income more than double the prior year results. Our Agricultural Products team delivered strong results from Europe and Asia, in advance of seasonal opportunities for its products in North America. Specialty Chemicals results were on plan. In addition, we reached an important financial milestone during the quarter, as our credit profile improved to investment grade."
 
Revenue in Agricultural Products was $196.4 million, an increase of 2 percent versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher herbicide sales in Europe and insecticide sales in Asia. As expected, segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") declined to $44.6 million from $48.0 million a year ago, as the impact of generic bifenthrin competition in North America more than offset strong performance in Europe

Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $148.7 million, an increase of 5 percent versus the prior year quarter. BioPolymer revenue grew modestly, primarily due to stronger demand in the food ingredients market. Lithium revenue benefited from higher sales in Europe due to the timing of campaigns in the polymer and pharmaceutical synthesis markets. Segment earnings increased 6 percent versus the prior year quarter to $32.0 million, driven by higher selling prices and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased raw material and energy costs.
 
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $221.5 million, an increase of 10 percent from the prior year quarter. The soda ash business accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices. Foret also benefited from higher selling prices, as well as favorable foreign currency translation. Segment earnings of $24.5 million increased substantially over the $11.0 million earned last year, driven by significantly higher domestic and export soda ash selling prices.
 
Corporate expense of $11.1 million was up $1.3 million versus $9.8 million in the second quarter of 2004. Interest expense, net, was $17.0 million, down from $20.6 million in the prior-year period due to lower interest rates and debt levels. On June 30, 2005, gross consolidated debt was $881.5 million, and debt, net of cash, was $612.4 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $35.5 million, and capital expenditures were $22.7 million.
 
Six Months Results
 
Revenue was $1,118.0 million, an increase of 8 percent as compared with $1,040.0 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $95.7 million, up substantially from $36.2 million in the year-earlier period. Net income in the current period included restructuring and other income and charges of $0.1 million, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $20.3 million in the prior year period. Excluding these charges, the company earned $95.6 million in the first half of 2005, as compared to $56.5 million in the first half of 2004.

Revenue in Agricultural Products was $394.5 million, an increase of 8 percent versus the prior-year period. The majority of increase resulted from higher insecticide sales in Brazil due to increases in planted acreage and strong pest pressures. Higher herbicide sales in Europe and increased insecticide sales in Asia also contributed to the increase. Revenues in North America were slightly lower compared with the prior-year period due to the impact of generic competition. Segment earnings were $78.2 million, an increase of 16 percent from the first half of 2004 due to higher sales, improved product mix and continued manufacturing productivity improvements.
 
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $285.5 million, an increase of 3 percent versus the prior-year period, driven by stronger BioPolymer demand in the food ingredients market and higher lithium sales to polymer and pharmaceutical synthesis markets. Segment earnings of $60.4 increased 10 percent versus the year-earlier period due to higher selling prices, improved mix and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased raw material and energy costs.
 
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $439.9, an increase of 10 percent versus the prior-year period. The soda ash business accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices. Foret also benefited from higher selling prices, as well as favorable foreign currency translation. Segment earnings of $46.1 million increased substantially versus $17.7 million in the year-earlier period, driven by significantly higher domestic and export soda ash selling prices, offset in part by higher raw material, transportation and energy costs.

Corporate expense of $22.3 million was up from $19.1 million in the year-earlier period. Interest expense, net, was $34.0 million, down from $41.0 million in the prior-year period due to lower interest rates and debt levels. For the period, depreciation and amortization was $70.1 million, and capital expenditures were $36.6 million.
 
Outlook
 
Regarding outlook and guidance for 2005, Walter said: "With our strong first half performance, we have raised our full-year outlook for earnings, before restructuring and other income and charges, to $4.30-$4.40 per diluted share. This implies an outlook for the remainder of 2005 that is largely unchanged from our previous outlook."
 
Walter added: "For the third quarter of 2005, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of between $0.80 and $0.90 per diluted share. The primary drivers of earnings are expected to be higher domestic and export soda ash selling prices and the benefit of reduced interest expense, partially offset by costs associated with the startup of our Granger, Wyo., soda ash facility and planned maintenance shutdowns at Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals facilities."
