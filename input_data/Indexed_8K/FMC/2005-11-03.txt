FMC Corporation Announces Third Quarter 2005 Results
 
Reports 9 Percent Increase in Earnings per Share Before Restructuring and Other Income and Charges
 
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported a net loss of $4.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2005, versus net income of $29.5 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2004. The net loss for the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $38.1 million after-tax, or $0.97 per diluted share, that primarily related to the redemption of debt and repatriation of cash under the American Jobs Creation Act. Excluding these charges, the company earned $0.85 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 9 percent versus $0.78 per diluted share in the third quarter 2004. Third quarter revenue of $510.0 million increased 3 percent versus $497.5 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, November 2, 2005
 
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: "FMC performed well this quarter despite challenging economic and operating conditions. We delivered earnings before restructuring and other income and charges at the midpoint of our previously issued outlook of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Our financial position has never been stronger. While the external business environment will likely remain challenging, we will continue to manage our businesses to create value for our shareholders."

Revenue in Agricultural Products was $161.3 million, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 2 percent compared with the prior-year quarter. Strong sales growth in Asia was essentially offset by the expected impact from generic bifenthrin competition in North America and slightly lower sales in Latin America following an exceptionally strong performance in the third quarter of 2004. Despite the modest decline in sales, segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") were level with last year as sales growth in Asia and manufacturing and operational productivity gains offset the impacts from generic bifenthrin competition, the slightly weaker Brazilian agricultural economy and higher raw material and energy costs.
 
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $137.2 million, an increase of 2 percent versus the prior-year quarter, driven by strong demand growth and higher selling prices in Lithium. Segment earnings increased 26 percent versus the year ago quarter due to strong demand growth and higher selling prices in Lithium and improved results in the food ingredients business of BioPolymer.
 
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $212.3 million, an increase of 6 percent from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher selling prices across the group, particularly in soda ash. Segment earnings of $18.1 million were down $3.1 million versus the year ago quarter, as startup costs associated with the Granger soda ash facility, higher energy and raw material costs and the operational impacts from Hurricane Rita on the hydrogen peroxide and soda ash businesses more than offset the benefit of higher selling prices.

Corporate expense of $11.1 million was up $1.6 million versus $9.5 million in the third quarter of 2004. Interest expense, net, was $13.3 million, down from $19.9 million in the prior-year period due to lower interest rates and debt levels. On September 30, 2005, gross consolidated debt was $701.6 million, and debt, net of cash, was $607.8 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $33.7 million, and capital expenditures were $22.9 million.
 
Nine Months Results
 
Revenue was $1,628.0 million, an increase of 6 percent as compared with $1,537.5 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $91.3 million, up substantially from $65.7 million in the year-earlier period. Net income in the current period included restructuring and other income and charges of $38.0 million, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $20.3 million in the prior-year period. Excluding these charges, the company earned $129.3 million in the first nine months of 2005, as compared to $86.0 million in the same period of 2004.
 
Revenue in Agricultural Products was $555.8 million, an increase of 5 percent versus the prior-year period. The majority of the increase resulted from stronger results in Brazil, higher herbicide sales in Europe and increased insecticide sales in Asia. Revenues in North America were slightly lower compared with the prior-year period due to the impact of generic bifenthrin competition. Segment earnings were $104.6 million, an increase of 10 percent from the year-earlier period due to higher sales, improved product mix and continued manufacturing and operational productivity initiatives.

Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $422.7 million, an increase of 3 percent versus the prior-year period, driven by strong demand growth and higher pricing in Lithium and improved food ingredients results in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $85.2 million increased 15 percent versus the year-earlier period due to strong demand growth and higher selling prices in Lithium, improved product mix and stronger operating results in the food ingredients business of BioPolymer.
 
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $652.2 million, an increase of 9 percent versus the prior-year period. The soda ash business accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices. Foret benefited from higher selling prices, as well as favorable foreign currency translation. Segment earnings of $64.2 million increased substantially versus $38.9 million in the year-earlier period, driven by higher selling prices for soda ash and peroxygens, offset in part by higher raw material, energy and transportation costs and the startup costs associated with Granger.
 
Corporate expense of $33.4 million was up from $28.6 million in the year-earlier period. Interest expense, net, was $47.3 million, down from $60.9 million in the prior-year period due to lower interest rates and debt levels. For the period, depreciation and amortization was $103.8 million, and capital expenditures were $59.5 million.

Outlook
 
Regarding outlook for 2005, Walter said, "We expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $4.20 to $4.30 per diluted share which, at the midpoint of the range, represents a 33 percent increase above 2004."
 
Walter added: "This full-year outlook implies earnings before restructuring and other income and charges for the fourth quarter of $0.89 to $0.99 per diluted share. Earnings growth of approximately 20 percent is expected in Specialty Chemicals as a result of higher selling prices and improved product mix. Earnings in Industrial Chemicals are expected to be flat to up slightly, depending on the timing of the closing on the sale of Astaris, as higher energy prices will largely offset higher selling prices across the segment's businesses. In Agricultural Products, earnings are expected to be 15-20 percent lower as a result of the impact of generic bifenthrin competition, higher raw materials costs and Brazilian profits slightly lower than the exceptionally strong results in the fourth quarter of 2004. And as a result of our refinancing, interest expense should be approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter."
