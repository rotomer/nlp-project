Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 16, 2005, FMC Finance, B.V. (the "Borrower"), FMC Corporation (the "Company"), and FMC Chemicals Netherlands, B.V. (the "European Parent") executed a Credit Agreement with certain lenders party thereto, Citibank International plc, as administrative agent for the lenders, ABN Amro Bank N.V., Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Agentaria S.A., National City Bank and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as mandated lead arrangers, and Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Banc of America Securities LLC, as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners (the "Credit Agreement"). The Borrower and the European Parent are Dutch companies and wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. The obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and the European Parent.
 
The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 220,000,000, equivalent to approximately US$264 million. Borrowings may be denominated in euros or U.S. dollars. The full amount under the Credit Agreement has been drawn. Proceeds will be distributed, indirectly, to the Company and applied to the repayment of the approximately $244 million term loan outstanding under the Company's domestic credit agreement and for other general corporate purposes.
 
Amounts under the Credit Agreement may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until its maturity on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions under the Credit Agreement are permitted at any time upon proper notice and subject to minimum payment amounts. If a voluntary prepayment is made other than on the last day of an interest period for a loan, the Borrower will be required to pay breakage costs in addition to the voluntary prepayment.
 
Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a eurocurrency base rate, which for loans denominated in euros is the Euro Interbank Offer Rate, and for loans denominated in dollars is the average rate at which deposits in dollars are offered by the principal offices of the lenders under the Credit Agreement in London to major banks in the London interbank market, as further described in the Credit Agreement, in each case plus a margin. The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on the ratings assigned to the Credit Agreement or the Company by each of Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services. Initially the margin is 0.40 percent.
 
Under the Credit Agreement, the Borrower is required to pay a commitment fee on the difference between the total amount of the Credit Agreement and the amount borrowed or otherwise utilized by the Borrower. The commitment fee is initially 0.130 percent and is subject to adjustment in the same manner as the applicable margin described above.
 
The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Credit Agreement and reference is made to the complete text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
Some of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with the Company and its subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking, trust and leasing services. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries have entered into interest rate, foreign exchange and energy derivative arrangements with some of the lenders and their affiliates.

In our examination of the above-mentioned documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
We have assumed that the Borrower and the European Parent have duly authorized, executed and delivered the Credit Agreement and, in the case of the Borrower, the Notes pursuant to adequate corporate power and in accordance with the laws of The Netherlands and that doing so does not violate, contravene or cause a default under the laws of The Netherlands.

6. The borrowings by and other financial accommodations provided to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and the application of proceeds thereof as provided in the Credit Agreement will not violate Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

However, except to the extent expressly stated herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of such facts, and no inference as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of such facts should be drawn from the fact of our representation of the Loan Parties.
