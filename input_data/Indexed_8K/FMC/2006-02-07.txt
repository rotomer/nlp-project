 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $25.3 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005, versus net income of $94.5 million, or $2.47 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $17.4 million after-tax, or charges of $0.44 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $60.7 million after-tax, or income of $1.59 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items, the company earned $1.08 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 23 percent versus $0.88 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter revenue of $522.2 million increased 2 percent versus $513.7 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, February 6, 2006
 
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: "Our fourth quarter performance provided a strong finish to a very good year for the company. 2005 was a year of significant accomplishment in which we met or exceeded our strategic objectives regarding earnings growth, capital structure and return on invested capital. While the external business environment will likely remain challenging, FMC enters 2006 well positioned, with full strategic and financial flexibility to manage our businesses to further create value for our shareholders."

Revenue in Agricultural Products was $168.7 million, a decrease of 2 percent compared with the prior-year quarter. Higher sales in South America and Asia were more than offset by continued bifenthrin pricing pressure and an expected shift of North American demand into the first quarter of 2006. As expected, segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") of $20.2 million declined 15 percent versus prior year due to the impact of lower sales and higher raw material and energy costs.
 
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $135.8 million, an increase of 7 percent versus the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by strong global demand and higher selling prices in lithium. Segment earnings of $22.9 million increased 6 percent versus the year ago quarter, as a result of the strong lithium performance, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs.
 
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $218.2 million, an increase of 2 percent from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher selling prices across the group, particularly for soda ash. Segment earnings of $19.7 million increased 7 percent versus the year ago quarter, as higher selling prices were partially offset by higher energy, raw material and transportation costs and the partial-quarter absence of profits from Astaris, which was divested in November 2005.
 
Corporate expense of $11.7 million was level to a year ago. Interest expense, net, was $10.8 million, down from $17.5 million in the prior-year period due to lower interest rates and debt levels. On December 31, 2005, gross consolidated debt was $720.2 million, and debt, net of cash, was $513.8 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $32.5 million and capital expenditures were $34.0 million.

Full-Year 2005 Results
 
Revenue was $2,150.2 million, an increase of 5 percent as compared with $2,051.2 million in the prior year. Net income was $116.6 million, or $2.97 per diluted share, versus $160.2 million, or $4.28 per diluted share, in the prior year. Net income in the current period included restructuring and other income and charges of $55.3 million, or charges of $1.42 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $40.4 million, or income of $1.08 per diluted share in the prior year. Excluding these items, the company earned $171.9 million, or $4.39 per diluted share, for the full year 2005, an increase of 37 percent as compared to $119.8 million, or $3.20 per diluted share, for the full year 2004.
 
Revenue in Agricultural Products was $724.5 million, an increase of 3 percent versus the prior year, driven by stronger results in South America, Asia and Europe. Revenues in North America were lower compared with the prior year due to the impact of generic bifenthrin competition. Segment earnings were $124.8 million, an increase of 5 percent from the year earlier, as a result of the higher sales and the favorable impact of manufacturing productivity initiatives, which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition and higher raw material and energy costs.
 
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $558.5 million, an increase of 4 percent versus the prior year, driven by strong global demand and higher pricing in lithium. Segment earnings of $108.1 million increased 12 percent versus the prior year. The strong lithium performance, improved results in the BioPolymer food ingredients business and the benefits of BioPolymer restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs.

Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $870.4 million, an increase of 7 percent versus the prior year. The soda ash business accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices. North American hydrogen peroxide and Foret also benefited from higher selling prices. Segment earnings of $83.9 million increased 46 percent versus the prior year, driven by higher selling prices across the group and improved earnings from Astaris, offset in part by Granger soda ash plant startup expenses and higher raw material, energy and transportation costs.
 
Corporate expense of $45.1 million was up from $40.3 million in 2004. Interest expense, net, was $58.1 million, down from $78.4 million in the prior year due to lower interest rates and debt levels. For the period, depreciation and amortization was $136.3 million, and capital expenditures were $93.5 million.
 
Outlook
 
Regarding the outlook for the full year 2006, Walter said, "We anticipate further improvement in our financial results in 2006. We expect continued double-digit growth in earnings per share before restructuring and other income and charges to result in full-year earnings of between $5.00 and $5.20 per diluted share, driven by higher selling prices in Industrial Chemicals, lower interest expense and modest growth in Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Our cash flow generation is also expected to remain strong."
 
Walter added: "For the first quarter of 2006, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $1.30 to $1.40 per diluted share. Favorable timing issues in Agricultural Products, the full effect of the Industrial Chemicals price increases and significantly lower interest expense are expected to be the primary drivers of a very strong first quarter."
