FMC Corporation Announces First Quarter 2006 Results
Reports Earnings of $1.74 per Diluted Share before Restructuring and Other Income and Charges
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $67.7 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2006, versus net income of $64.5 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2005. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $1.3 million after-tax, or charges of $0.03 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $21.7 million, or income of $0.56 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items, the company earned $1.74 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 57 percent versus $1.11 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005. First quarter revenue of $594.1 million increased 8 percent versus $552.4 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, April 26, 2006
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: "The year is off to a very good start with strong first quarter performance across all of our businesses. Agricultural Products had an exceptional quarter, with strong sales growth in North America, Europe and Asia. Specialty Chemicals experienced good volume growth and higher selling prices, particularly in lithium. Industrial Chemicals continues to realize significant pricing leverage throughout its businesses. Our strong first quarter performance was achieved despite the impact of higher energy and raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation."

Revenue in Agricultural Products was $206.6 million, an increase of 4 percent compared with the prior year quarter, driven by higher sales in North America, Europe and Asia. Partially offsetting this revenue growth were the continued impact of generic bifenthrin competition in North America and modestly lower sales in Brazil due to lower planted cotton acres and more normal pest pressures relative to strong conditions a year ago. Segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") in the quarter were $54.7 million, up $21.1 million or 63 percent versus last year's quarter due to the higher sales and favorable product and geographic mix, offset in part by the continued impact of generic bifenthrin competition and higher raw material costs.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $143.2 million, an increase of 5 percent versus the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by strong global demand and higher selling prices in lithium. BioPolymer revenue was modestly higher as growth in the pharmaceutical and food ingredients markets was largely offset by lower sales to pet food, industrial and personal care markets. Segment earnings of $31.5 million increased 11 percent versus the year ago quarter, as a result of the strong lithium performance, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher raw material and energy costs.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $245.2 million, an increase of 12 percent from the prior-year quarter, as a result of higher selling prices across the group, particularly for soda ash. Segment earnings of $29.2 million increased 35 percent versus the year ago quarter as higher selling prices more than offset higher energy and raw material costs and the absence of profits from Astaris, which was divested in November 2005.

Corporate expense was $11.3 million, as compared to $11.2 million a year ago. Interest expense, net, was $8.4 million, down from $17.0 million in the prior-year period due to lower interest rates and debt levels. On March 31, 2006, gross consolidated debt was $726.6 million, and debt, net of cash, was $542.5 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $32.1 million and capital expenditures were $17.1 million.
Outlook
Regarding the outlook for 2006, Walter said: "With our strong first quarter performance, we have raised our full-year 2006 outlook for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to $5.35 to $5.55 per diluted share. Through the balance of the year, we expect to realize the ongoing benefits of higher selling prices in Industrial Chemicals, lower interest expense and continued profitable growth in Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals, though unfavorable currency translation and higher energy and raw material costs are expected to persist."
Walter added: "For the second quarter of 2006, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $1.40 to $1.50 per diluted share."
