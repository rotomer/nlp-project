FMC Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2006 Results
Reports Earnings of $1.47 per Diluted Share before Restructuring and Other Income and Charges
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $46.3 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006, versus net income of $31.2 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2005. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $12.2 million after-tax, or charges of $0.31 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $21.6 million, or charges of $0.55 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items, the company earned $1.47 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 9 percent versus $1.35 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2005. Second quarter revenue of $592.3 million increased 5 percent versus $565.6 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, August 1, 2006
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: "We delivered another quarter of good performance, with earnings at the high end of our expected range. FMC continues to benefit from the diversity of our end markets and relative insensitivity to GDP cycles. Agricultural Products met our earnings expectations through improved margins. Specialty Chemicals again delivered double-digit earnings growth on higher volumes and selling prices. Industrial Chemicals continued to realize significant pricing leverage, particularly in soda ash. Our second quarter performance was achieved despite the impacts of higher energy and raw material costs."

Revenue in Agricultural Products of $184.4 million was 6 percent lower than last year's quarter. Sales in North America and Europe were lower as a result of the previously reported shift of some product sales into the first quarter and the continued impact of generic competition. Sales in Asia continued to demonstrate good growth, while Latin American sales rose modestly. Despite the lower revenue, segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") of $44.5 million were essentially level to the $44.6 million a year ago. Margin expansion was achieved as a result of improved product mix and further supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset the revenue decline and higher raw material costs.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $156.6 million, an increase of 5 percent versus the prior-year quarter, driven by strong global demand and higher selling prices in lithium and pharmaceutical excipients in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $35.9 million increased 12 percent versus the year ago quarter, as a result of the strong lithium and pharmaceutical excipients performance, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher energy and raw material costs.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $252.3 million, an increase of 14 percent from the prior-year quarter, as sales gains were achieved across soda ash, peroxygens and Foret. Higher selling prices for soda ash and hydrogen peroxide were the primary drivers. Segment earnings of $24.9 million increased 2 percent versus the year ago quarter, as the revenue gains were mitigated by higher energy costs, particularly in Spain, higher raw material costs and the absence of profits from Astaris, which was divested in November 2005.

Corporate expense was $11.2 million, as compared to $11.1 million a year ago. Interest expense, net, was $9.2 million, down from $17.0 million in the prior-year period due to lower interest rates and debt levels. On June 30, 2006, gross consolidated debt was $680.4 million, and debt, net of cash, was $476.6 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $33.5 million and capital expenditures were $28.8 million.
Six Months Results
Revenue was $1,186.4 million, an increase of 6 percent as compared with $1,118.0 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $84.0 million, down 12 percent from $95.7 million in the year-earlier period. Net income in the current period included restructuring and other income and charges of $43.5 million, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $0.1 million in the prior-year period. Excluding these charges, the company earned $127.5 million in the first half of 2006, an increase of 33 percent versus $95.6 million in the first half of 2005.
Revenue in Agricultural Products was $391.0 million, a decrease of 1 percent versus the prior-year period. The continued impact of generic competition in North America and lower sales in Brazil more than offset continued growth in crop protection markets in North America, Europe and Asia. Segment earnings were $99.2 million, an increase of 27 percent from the first half of 2005 due to an improved product and geographic mix and continued supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset the unfavorable impacts of generic competition and higher raw material costs.

Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $299.8 million, an increase of 5 percent versus the prior-year period, driven by demand growth and higher selling prices for lithium and pharmaceutical excipients in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $67.3 increased 11 percent versus the year-earlier period due to the strong commercial performance in lithium and BioPolymer, which more than offset unfavorable foreign currency translation and increased energy and raw material costs.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $497.5 million, an increase of 13 percent versus the prior-year period as a result of higher selling prices for soda ash and hydrogen peroxide. Segment earnings of $54.2 million increased 18 percent versus the year-earlier period, driven by significantly higher domestic and export soda ash selling prices, despite higher raw material, transportation and energy costs and the absence of profits from Astaris, which was divested in November 2005.
Corporate expense was $22.5 million, as compared to $22.3 million in the year-earlier period. Interest expense, net, was $17.6 million, down from $34.0 million in the prior-year period due to lower interest rates and debt levels. For the period, depreciation and amortization was $65.6 million and capital expenditures were $45.9 million.

Outlook
Regarding the outlook for 2006, Walter said: "Based on our current outlook for each of our businesses, we are reaffirming our full-year 2006 outlook for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $5.35 to $5.55 per diluted share. Through the balance of the year, we expect to realize the ongoing benefits of higher selling prices in Industrial Chemicals, lower interest expense and continued growth in Specialty Chemicals and Agricultural Products, though unfavorable currency translation and higher energy and raw material costs are expected to persist."
Walter added: "For the third quarter of 2006, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share."
