FMC Corporation Announces Third Quarter 2006 Results
Reports Earnings of $1.02 per Diluted Share before Restructuring and Other Income and Charges
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $35.1 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006, versus a net loss of $4.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $5.3 million after-tax, or charges of $0.13 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $38.1 million after-tax, or charges of $0.97 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items, the company earned $1.02 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 20 percent versus $0.85 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005. Third quarter revenue of $572.2 million increased 12 percent versus $510.0 million in the prior-year quarter.
PHILADELPHIA, November 1, 2006
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: "Our third quarter performance clearly reflects the benefit we derive from the company's end market diversity and relative insensitivity to GDP cycles. Earnings increased 20 percent compared to the prior-year quarter, above the mid-point of our expected range. Agricultural Products' earnings growth was derived primarily from the strength of its market positions in South America. Specialty Chemicals benefited from good volume growth and higher selling prices. Industrial Chemicals continued to realize significant pricing leverage, particularly in soda ash. During the third quarter we repurchased approximately 821,000 shares at a total cost of $50 million. We will continue to balance the financial requirements of our growth initiatives with the opportunity to return cash to our shareholders."

Revenue in Agricultural Products of $180.4 million was 12 percent higher than last year's quarter, primarily due to increased sales in South America and the timing of sales in Europe and Asia. Brazil benefited from the growth in planted acres in sugar cane and cotton. Segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") of $28.5 million were 8 percent higher than prior-year quarter due to the higher sales, partially offset by a less favorable geographic mix, higher raw material costs and higher development spending associated with growth and innovation initiatives.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $147.0 million, an increase of 7 percent versus the prior-year quarter. Lithium sales growth was driven by higher volumes and selling prices in upstream primary compounds, as well as higher butyllithium volumes. BioPolymer sales increased as a result of broad-based growth in food, pharmaceutical and healthcare markets. Segment earnings of $27.0 million increased 9 percent versus a year ago, driven by the strong commercial performance in lithium and BioPolymer, mitigated somewhat by higher raw material and energy costs.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $245.7 million, an increase of 16 percent versus the prior-year quarter, as sales gains were achieved across soda ash, peroxygens and Foret. Higher selling prices for soda ash and hydrogen peroxide were the primary drivers. Segment earnings of $21.3 million increased 18 percent versus the year-ago quarter driven by the higher selling prices, partially offset by significantly higher energy costs, particularly in Spain, higher raw material costs and the absence of profits from Astaris, which was divested in November 2005.

Corporate expense was $11.3 million, as compared to $11.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense, net, was $7.5 million, down from $13.3 million in the prior-year quarter due to lower interest rates and debt levels. On September 30, 2006, gross consolidated debt was $676.9 million, and debt, net of cash, was $419.4 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $32.4 million and capital expenditures were $34.6 million.
Nine Months Results
Revenue was $1,758.6 million, an increase of 8 percent as compared with $1,628.0 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $119.1 million, up 30 percent from $91.3 million in the year-earlier period. Net income in the current period included restructuring and other income and charges of $48.8 million after-tax, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $38.0 million after-tax in the prior-year period. Excluding these charges, the company earned $167.9 million in the first nine months of 2006, an increase of 30 percent versus $129.3 million in the first nine months of 2005.
Revenue in Agricultural Products was $571.4 million, an increase of 3 percent versus the prior-year period. Sales growth in Latin America, Asia and North America was partially offset by the impact of generic price competition in North America. Segment earnings were $127.7 million, an increase of 22 percent from the first nine months of 2005, due to higher sales, an improved product mix and continued supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset the unfavorable impacts of generic competition and higher raw material costs.

Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $446.8 million, an increase of 6 percent versus the prior-year period, driven by volume growth and higher selling prices for lithium, particularly in upstream primary compounds, and BioPolymer products. Segment earnings of $94.3 million increased 11 percent versus the year-earlier period due to the strong commercial performance in lithium and BioPolymer, which more than offset increased energy and raw material costs.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $743.2 million, an increase of 14 percent versus the prior-year period, driven by higher selling prices for soda ash and hydrogen peroxide. Segment earnings of $75.5 million increased 18 percent versus the year-earlier period as a result of significantly higher selling prices, offset in part by higher raw material and energy costs, particularly in Spain, and the absence of profits from Astaris, which was divested in November 2005.
Corporate expense was $33.8 million, as compared to $33.4 million in the year-earlier period. Interest expense, net, was $25.1 million, down from $47.3 million in the prior-year period due to lower interest rates and debt levels. For the period, depreciation and amortization was $98.0 million and capital expenditures were $80.5 million.

Outlook
Regarding the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2006, Walter said: "We expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $1.12 to $1.22 per diluted share. Through the balance of the year, we expect to realize the ongoing benefits of higher selling prices in Industrial Chemicals, lower interest expense and continued growth in Specialty Chemicals, though higher energy and raw material costs are expected to persist."
Walter added: "As a result of our strong year-to-date performance and our expectation for the fourth quarter, our outlook for full-year 2006 earnings before restructuring and other income and charges is $5.35 to $5.45 per diluted share."
