FMC Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter 2006 Results
Reports Earnings of $1.24 per Diluted Share before Restructuring and Other Income and Charges
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $12.9 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006, versus net income of $25.3 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $35.6 million after-tax, or charges of $0.91 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $17.4 million after-tax, or charges of $0.44 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items, the company earned $1.24 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 15 percent versus $1.08 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005. Fourth quarter revenue of $588.4 million increased 13 percent versus $522.2 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, February 6, 2007
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: "Our good fourth quarter results capped off another year of strong performance for the company. 2006 marks our third straight year of earnings growth in excess of 20 percent. Agricultural Products once again benefited from its focused market strategies in South America, particularly in Brazil. Specialty Chemicals realized good volume growth, higher selling prices, particularly in lithium, and continued productivity improvements across the segment. Industrial Chemicals delivered another strong quarter as higher selling prices and volume growth in soda ash more than offset the impact of the challenging energy situation in Spain."
Page 2/ FMC Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter 2006 Results
Revenue in Agricultural Products of $195.6 million was 16 percent higher than last year's quarter as increased sales in Brazil were driven by better than expected market conditions in sugar cane and cotton segments. Segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") of $23.2 million were 15 percent higher than the prior-year quarter due to the higher sales, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix, increased selling expenses and higher development spending associated with growth and innovation initiatives.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $146.0 million, an increase of 8 percent versus the prior-year quarter, as a result of higher sales in food, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical markets in BioPolymer and higher selling prices for primary lithium compounds. Segment earnings of $24.5 million increased 7 percent versus the year-ago quarter, driven by improved performance in food ingredients in BioPolymer and higher selling prices in primary lithium compounds.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $247.7 million, an increase of 14 percent versus the prior-year quarter, as a result of higher selling prices across all businesses and volume growth in soda ash. Segment earnings of $21.2 million increased 8 percent versus the year-ago quarter driven by the sales gains, partially offset by significantly higher energy costs, particularly in Spain, and higher raw material costs.
Corporate expense was $12.4 million, as compared to $11.7 million a year ago. Interest expense, net, was $7.8 million, down from $10.8 million in the prior-year period. On December 31, 2006, gross consolidated debt was $629.7 million, and debt, net of cash, was $464.2 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $33.8 million and capital expenditures were $35.1 million.

Full Year 2006 Results
Revenue was $2,347.0 million, an increase of 9 percent as compared with $2,150.2 million in the prior year. Net income was $132.0 million, or $3.34 per diluted share, versus $116.6 million, or $2.97 per diluted share, in the prior year. Net income in 2006 included restructuring and other income and charges of $84.4 million, or charges of $2.14 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $55.3 million, or charges of $1.42 per diluted share in the prior year. Excluding these items, the company earned $216.4 million, or $5.48 per diluted share, for the full year 2006, an increase of 25 percent as compared to $171.9 million, or $4.39 per diluted share, for the full year 2005.
Revenue in Agricultural Products was $767.0 million, an increase of 6 percent versus the prior year, driven largely by strong sales growth in South America, particularly Brazil, as well as higher herbicide sales in North America and increased sales in Asia. Segment earnings were $151.0 million, an increase of 21 percent from the year earlier, as a result of higher sales and the favorable impact of supply chain productivity initiatives which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition, higher raw material costs and increased spending associated with growth and innovation initiatives.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $592.8 million, an increase of 6 percent versus the prior year, driven by higher sales of primary lithium compounds and continued strength in BioPolymer's pharmaceutical business. Segment earnings of $118.8 million increased 10 percent versus the prior year. The sales gains, improved results in BioPolymer's food ingredients business and the benefit of restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs and increased spending for growth initiatives.

Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $990.9 million, an increase of 14 percent versus the prior year. The soda ash business accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices and higher volumes. North American hydrogen peroxide also benefited from higher selling prices and energy surcharges. Segment earnings of $96.7 million increased 15 percent versus the prior year driven by the sales gains offset in part by higher energy costs, particularly for natural gas in Spain, higher raw material costs and the absence of earnings from Astaris, which was divested in November 2005.
Corporate expense of $46.2 million was up from $45.1 million in 2005. Interest expense, net, was $32.9 million, down from $58.1 million in the prior year due to lower interest rates and debt levels. For the year, depreciation and amortization was $131.8 million, and capital expenditures were $115.6 million.
Outlook
Regarding the outlook for the full year 2007, Walter said: "We expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $5.70-$6.00 per diluted share, driven by continued growth in Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals. We expect Industrial Chemicals to regain its earnings growth momentum in the second half of the year and deliver significant earnings growth in 2008."

Walter added: "For the first quarter 2007, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $1.60-$1.70 per diluted share, as continued growth in Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals and the benefit of higher soda ash selling prices will be more than offset by higher costs for energy, particularly in Spain, and raw materials."
In closing, Walter said, "We will continue to diligently work to further unlock the operating leverage inherent in our businesses and focus resources on our higher growth businesses. With our strong franchise businesses and combination of financial and strategic flexibility, we will continue our focus on creating significant value for our shareholders."
