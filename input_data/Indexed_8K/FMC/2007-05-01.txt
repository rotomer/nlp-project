FMC Corporation Announces First Quarter 2007 Results
Reports Earnings of $1.83 per Diluted Share before Restructuring and Other Income and Charges
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $45.8 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007, versus net income of $37.7 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2006. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $25.9 million after-tax, or charges of $0.66 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $31.3 million after-tax, or charges of $0.79 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items, the company earned $1.83 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 5 percent versus $1.74 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006. First quarter revenue of $674.1 million increased 13 percent versus $594.1 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, April 30, 2007
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: "The year is off to a great start with strong first quarter sales growth across all of our businesses. Agricultural Products had an outstanding quarter with growth reported in all geographic regions and product lines. Specialty Chemicals experienced strong global demand and higher selling prices for lithium and increased sales in food ingredients and pharmaceutical markets in BioPolymer. Industrial Chemicals delivered good top line growth on the strength of our soda ash business. Our strong first quarter sales growth translated into record first quarter earnings despite the impact of higher energy and raw material costs, and the effect of continued lower electricity selling prices in Spain."

Revenue in Agricultural Products was $248.3 million, an increase of 20 percent compared with the prior year quarter, driven by particularly strong sales growth in Brazil as a result of increased planted acres in cotton and sugar cane, more normal weather conditions in Europe than a year ago, strong early season demand in North America and new product introductions. Segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") in the quarter were $70.8 million, up 29 percent versus last year's quarter, due to the higher sales and the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements partially offset by increased spending on growth initiatives.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $166.2 million, an increase of 16 percent versus the prior-year quarter, driven by strong global demand and higher selling prices in lithium and increased sales across all end use markets in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $35.6 million increased 13 percent versus the year ago quarter as a result of the strong sales growth, partially offset by less favorable product mix and higher energy and raw material costs.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $260.6 million, an increase of 6 percent from the prior-year quarter, as a result of higher selling prices and volumes in soda ash. Segment earnings of $17.5 million decreased 40 percent versus the year ago quarter as higher energy costs across the segment and lower electricity selling prices in Spain more than offset the positive impacts of higher selling prices and volume growth in soda ash.

Corporate expense was $13.1 million, as compared to $11.3 million a year ago. Interest expense, net, was $8.4 million, level to the prior-year period. On March 31, 2007, gross consolidated debt was $617.7 million, and debt, net of cash, was $568.5 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $34.5 million and capital expenditures were $20.4 million.
Outlook
Regarding the outlook for 2007, Walter said: "With our strong first quarter performance, we have raised our full-year 2007 outlook for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to $6.00 to $6.20 per diluted share. For the year, we anticipate stronger growth in Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals than previously expected, while our outlook for Industrial Chemicals is unchanged. We remain confident that despite the current unfavorable energy environment in Spain, Industrial Chemicals will be back on track building considerable earnings momentum by mid-year and delivering strong earnings growth in the second half of 2007."
Walter added: "For the second quarter of 2007, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share."

Restructuring and other charges also includes a gain representing the difference between the carrying value of our remaining investment in the Astaris joint venture, and cash received from this investment representing a return of our investment. After this cash receipt, our investment in the Astaris joint venture is $0 at March 31, 2007. This gain included in "Equity in (earnings) of affiliates" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2007. In 2005, Astaris sold substantially all of the assets of its business and the buyers also assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Astaris.
Restructuring and other charges for the three months ended March 31, 2006 primarily include a charge of 25 million (US$30 million) related to a fine imposed on us by the European Commission as a result of alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe prior to 2000. This fine is associated with our Industrial Chemicals segment. We have appealed the decision of the European Commission.
