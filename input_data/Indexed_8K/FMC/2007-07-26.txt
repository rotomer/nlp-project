FMC Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2007 Results
Reports Earnings of $1.79 per Diluted Share before Restructuring and Other Income and Charges
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $8.6 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007, versus net income of $46.3 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $61.2 million after-tax, or charges of $1.57 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $12.2 million after-tax, or charges of $0.31 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items, the company earned $1.79 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 22 percent versus $1.47 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006. Second quarter revenue of $657.9 million increased 11 percent versus $592.3 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, July 25, 2007
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: "We once again delivered strong results with record second quarter sales and earnings. Agricultural Products turned in exceptional performance as a result of very strong sales growth and continued supply chain productivity improvements. Specialty Chemicals' earnings benefited from good end-use demand growth and selective price increases. Industrial Chemicals continued to realize significant pricing leverage, particularly in soda ash. Our results were achieved despite continued higher energy and raw material costs."

Revenue in Agricultural Products of $219.2 million was 19 percent higher than last year's quarter, driven by particularly strong sales growth in Brazil as a result of increased planted acres in sugar cane, corn and cotton, higher sales in Europe due to increased demand for biofuel crops and the benefit of a stronger Euro. Segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") of $65.1 million were up 46 percent versus the year ago quarter, driven by the higher sales and continued supply chain productivity improvements.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $167.5 million, an increase of 7 percent versus the prior-year quarter, as a result of higher selling prices in lithium and broad-based sales growth in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $39.5 million increased 10 percent versus the year ago quarter, as a result of the strong lithium and BioPolymer commercial performance and the benefit of continued productivity improvements.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $272.2 million, an increase of 8 percent from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher volumes and selling prices for soda ash and volume growth at Foret. Segment earnings of $21.5 million decreased 14 percent versus the year ago quarter, as the revenue gains were mitigated by higher energy and raw material costs and lower electricity selling prices in Spain.
Corporate expense was $14.3 million, up from $11.2 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense, net, was $10.0 million as compared to $9.2 million in the prior-year period. On June 30, 2007, gross consolidated debt was $598.8 million, and debt, net of cash, was $535.7 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $33.9 million and capital expenditures were $24.2 million.

Six Months Results
Revenue was $1,332.0 million, an increase of 12 percent as compared with $1,186.4 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $54.4 million, down 35 percent from $84.0 million in the year-earlier period. Net income in the current period included restructuring and other income and charges of $87.1 million, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $43.5 million in the prior-year period. Excluding these charges, the company earned $141.5 million in the first half of 2007, an increase of 11 percent versus $127.5 million in the first half of 2006.
Revenue in Agricultural Products was $467.5 million, an increase of 20 percent versus the prior-year period. Higher sales were realized in most geographic regions, but were particularly strong in Brazil due to increased planted acres in sugar cane, corn and cotton and in Europe driven primarily by increased demand for biofuel crops. Segment earnings were $135.9 million, an increase of 37 percent from the first half of 2006 as a result of the higher sales and continued supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset higher incremental selling and distribution costs and increased spending on growth initiatives.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $333.7 million, an increase of 11 percent versus the prior-year period, driven by higher selling prices in lithium and strong commercial performance in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $75.1 million increased 12 percent versus the year-earlier period due to higher sales and productivity improvements, which more than offset increased energy and raw material costs.

Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $532.7 million, an increase of 7 percent versus the prior-year period, as a result of higher volumes and selling prices for soda ash. Segment earnings of $39.1 million decreased 28 percent versus the year-earlier period, as higher energy and raw material costs across the segment and lower electricity selling prices in Spain more than offset the positive impact of higher sales.
Corporate expense was $27.5 million, as compared to $22.5 million in the year-earlier period. Interest expense, net, was $18.4 million, up from $17.6 million in the prior-year period (due to higher foreign interest rates). For the period, depreciation and amortization was $68.4 million and capital expenditures were $44.6 million.
Outlook
Regarding the outlook for 2007, Walter said: "Based on our strong first half performance, we are raising our full-year 2007 outlook for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to $6.20 to $6.40 per diluted share. Through the balance of the year, we expect to realize the ongoing benefits of continued growth in Specialty Chemicals, Agricultural Products and soda ash as well as improved energy market conditions in Foret."
Walter added: "For the third quarter of 2007, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $1.25 to $1.35 per diluted share."
