FMC Corporation Announces Third Quarter 2007 Results
Reports Earnings of $0.69 per Diluted Share before Restructuring and Other Income and Charges
FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $37.1 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007, versus net income of $35.1 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $15.9 million after-tax, or charges of $0.21 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $5.3 million after-tax, or charges of $0.07 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items, the company earned $0.69 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 35 percent versus $0.51 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006. Third quarter revenue of $626.6 million increased 10 percent versus $572.2 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, October 31, 2007
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: "Our record third quarter results were on plan with another quarter of strong Agricultural Products performance across all regions, continued volume growth and pricing improvement in Specialty Chemicals and the return of Industrial Chemicals' profit momentum. These results reflect, in my view, the fundamental strengths of the Company  our global footprint, the non-cyclical nature of our end-use markets and the absence of any significant petrochemical exposure."

Revenue in Agricultural Products of $192.7 million was 7 percent higher than last year's quarter. Sales gains were achieved in all regions, and were particularly strong in Europe, Asia and Brazil. Segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") of $39.2 million were up 38 percent versus the year ago quarter, driven by the higher sales and continued supply chain productivity improvements.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $164.8 million, an increase of 12 percent versus the prior-year quarter, as a result of higher volumes and selling prices in lithium and strong commercial performance in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $33.5 million increased 24 percent versus the year ago quarter, as a result of the higher sales and continued productivity improvements.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $269.9 million, an increase of 10 percent from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher volumes and selling prices for soda ash and volume growth at Foret. Segment earnings of $24.6 million increased 15 percent versus the year ago quarter, as the higher sales more than offset higher energy and raw material costs.
Corporate expense was $12.0 million, up from $11.3 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense, net, was $8.6 million as compared to $7.5 million in the prior-year period. On September 30, 2007, gross consolidated debt was $572.1 million, and debt, net of cash, was $456.2 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $32.3 million and capital expenditures were $31.9 million.

Nine Months Results
Revenue was $1,958.6 million, an increase of 11 percent versus $1,758.6 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $91.5 million as compared to $119.1 million in the year-earlier period. Net income in the current period included restructuring and other income and charges of $103.0 million, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $48.8 million in the prior-year period. Excluding these charges, the company earned $194.5 million in the first nine months of 2007, an increase of 16 percent versus $167.9 million in the first nine months of 2006.
Revenue in Agricultural Products was $660.2 million, an increase of 16 percent versus the prior-year period. Higher sales were realized in all geographic regions, but were particularly strong in Brazil due to increased planted acres in sugar cane, corn and cotton and in Europe driven primarily by increased demand for biofuel crops and more favorable weather conditions than a year ago. Segment earnings of $175.1 million increased 37 percent versus the first nine months of 2006 as a result of the higher sales and continued supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset higher incremental selling and distribution costs due to the higher sales.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $498.5 million, an increase of 12 percent versus the prior-year period, driven by higher selling prices and volumes in lithium and strong commercial performance in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $108.6 million increased 15 percent versus the year-earlier period due to higher sales and continued productivity improvements, which more than offset increased energy and raw material costs.

Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $802.6 million, an increase of 8 percent versus the prior-year period, as a result of higher volumes and selling prices for soda ash. Segment earnings of $63.7 million decreased 16 percent versus the year-earlier period, as higher energy and raw material costs across the segment and lower electricity selling prices in Spain more than offset the positive impact of higher sales.
Corporate expense was $39.5 million, as compared to $33.8 million in the year-earlier period. Interest expense, net, was $27.0 million, up from $25.1 million in the prior-year period. For the period, depreciation and amortization was $100.7 million and capital expenditures were $76.5 million.
Outlook
Regarding the outlook for 2007, Walter said: "Based on our strong year-to-date performance we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $3.10 to $3.20 per diluted share
Walter added: "For the fourth quarter of 2007, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $0.60 to $0.70 per diluted share. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2006, strong earnings growth in all operating segments is expected to be offset in large part by non-cash LIFO expense and higher book tax rate."
