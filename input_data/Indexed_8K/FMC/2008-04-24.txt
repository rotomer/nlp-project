FMC Corporation Announces First Quarter 2008 Results
 
 
 
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $93.9 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2008, versus net income of $45.8 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $2.7 million after-tax, or a gain of $0.04 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $25.9 million after-tax, or charges of $0.33 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items in both periods, the company earned $1.19 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 29 percent versus $0.92 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007. First quarter revenue of $750.2 million increased 11 percent versus $674.1 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, April 23, 2008
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "We had a record quarter with strong performance across all our businesses. Agricultural Products achieved sales gains in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Specialty Chemicals experienced strong commercial performance in BioPolymer and lithium specialties. Industrial Chemicals more than doubled earnings, driven by higher selling prices and volume growth across the segment. Our first quarter results were achieved despite the adverse pressure of higher raw material costs across all of our businesses."

Revenue in Agricultural Products of $277.5 million was 12 percent higher than the prior-year quarter. Sales gains driven by buoyant agrochemical market conditions were achieved in Asia, Europe and Latin America, particularly in Brazil. Segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") of $82.9 million were up 17 percent versus the year-ago quarter, as a result of the higher sales and continued global supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset higher raw material costs.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $183.7 million, an increase of 11 percent versus the prior-year quarter, due to higher selling prices and volume growth in BioPolymer and lithium specialties. Segment earnings of $39.5 million increased 11 percent versus the year-ago quarter, as a result of the higher sales. Continued manufacturing productivity improvements offset higher raw material costs.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $290.4 million, an increase of 11 percent from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher selling prices across the segment, particularly in soda ash and phosphates, and volume growth. Segment earnings of $35.6 million increased 103 percent versus the year-ago quarter, as the higher sales and improved power market conditions in Spain more than offset higher raw material costs.
Corporate expense was $11.9 million, down from $13.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense, net, was $8.7 million as compared to $8.4 million in the year-ago quarter. On March 31, 2008, gross consolidated debt was $615.0 million, and debt, net of cash, was $544.6 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $31.0 million and capital expenditures were $32.6 million.

Outlook
Regarding the outlook for balance of 2008, Walter said, "We expect another record year and have raised our outlook for 2008 with earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to $3.90 to $4.10 per diluted share. We look for continued earnings growth in Agricultural Products driven by higher sales and further supply chain productivity improvements. In Specialty Chemicals, we expect earnings growth to be realized through strong commercial performance in BioPolymer. Industrial Chemicals will continue to benefit from higher selling prices and volume growth across the segment. We plan to achieve these results despite facing higher raw material costs in all businesses. In 2008, we will once again derive significant benefit from our global footprint, the non-cyclical nature of our end-use markets and our limited exposure to rising petrochemical costs."
Walter added, "For the second quarter of 2008, we anticipate continued strong performance across all segments with earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $1.10 to $1.20 per diluted share."
FMC will conduct its first quarter conference call and webcast at 11:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, April 24, 2008. This event will be available live and as a replay on the web at . Prior to the conference call, the Company will also provide supplemental information on the web including its 2008 Outlook Statement, definitions of non-GAAP terms and reconciliations of non-GAAP figures to the nearest available GAAP term.
