FMC Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2008 Results
 
 
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $84.4 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2008, versus net income of $8.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $14.5 million after-tax, or a charge of $0.19 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $61.2 million after-tax, or charges of $0.79 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items in both periods, the company earned $1.29 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 43 percent versus $0.90 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2007. Second quarter revenue of $806.6 million increased 23 percent versus $657.9 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, July 29, 2008
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Our record second quarter results were driven by strong sales growth across all our businesses. Agricultural Products realized higher sales in all regions and across all product lines. Specialty Chemicals delivered strong commercial performance in both BioPolymer and lithium. Industrial Chemicals achieved higher selling prices and volumes across the segment. Our second quarter performance reflects the diversity and attractiveness of our end-use markets and the value of our global footprint."

Revenue in Agricultural Products of $276.6 million was 26 percent higher than the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in all regions particularly Europe, North America and Asia. Segment earnings before interest and taxes ("segment earnings") of $84.4 million were up 30 percent versus the year-ago quarter, as a result of the higher sales and continued global supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset higher raw material costs.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $192.4 million, an increase of 15 percent versus the prior-year quarter, as higher selling prices and volume growth were realized in BioPolymer and lithium. Segment earnings of $41.5 million increased 5 percent versus the year-ago quarter due to the higher sales and the favorable impact of currency translation, largely offset by increased costs for raw materials, energy and export taxes.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $338.9 million, an increase of 25 percent from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher selling prices, particularly in soda ash and phosphates, and volumes across the segment. Segment earnings of $45.3 million increased 111 percent versus the year-ago quarter, as the higher sales and improved power market conditions in Spain more than offset higher raw material costs.
Corporate expense was $13.1 million, down from $14.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense, net, was $8.3 million as compared to $10.0 million in the year-ago quarter. On June 30, 2008, gross consolidated debt was $554.3 million, and debt, net of cash, was $431.0 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $30.7 million and capital expenditures were $33.8 million.

Six Months Results
Revenue was $1,556.8 million, an increase of 17 percent as compared with $1,332.0 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $178.3 million, up 228 percent from $54.4 million in the year-earlier period. Net income in the current period included restructuring and other income and charges of $11.8 million, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $87.1 million in the prior-year period. Excluding these charges, the company earned $190.1 million in the first half of 2008, an increase of 34 percent versus $141.5 million in the first half of 2007.
Revenue in Agricultural Products was $554.1 million, an increase of 19 percent versus the prior-year period. Sales gains benefited from buoyant global agrochemical market conditions and new product introductions. Segment earnings were $167.4 million, an increase of 23 percent from the first half of 2007 as a result of the higher sales and continued global supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset higher raw material costs.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $376.2 million, an increase of 13 percent versus the prior-year period, driven by strong commercial performance in BioPolymer and lithium. Segment earnings of $81.0 million increased 8 percent versus the year-earlier period as a result of the higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs and export taxes.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $629.3 million, an increase of 18 percent versus the prior-year period, driven by higher selling prices across the segment, particularly in soda ash and phosphates, and volume growth. Segment earnings of $80.8 million increased 107 percent versus the year-earlier period, as the higher sales and improved power market conditions in Spain more than offset higher raw material costs.

Corporate expense was $25.0 million, as compared to $27.5 million in the year-earlier period. Interest expense, net, was $17.0 million, down from $18.4 million in the prior-year period. For the period, depreciation and amortization was $61.7 million and capital expenditures were $66.4 million.
Outlook
Regarding the outlook for the balance of 2008, Walter said, "Based on our strong first-half results, we have raised our full-year 2008 outlook for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to $4.20 to $4.40 per diluted share. We look for continued earnings growth in Agricultural Products driven by broad-based sales growth. In Specialty Chemicals, we expect earnings growth to be realized through strong commercial performance in BioPolymer and lithium. Industrial Chemicals will continue to derive significant benefit from higher selling prices and volume growth across the segment. We are confident that we will achieve these results despite the headwind of accelerating raw material cost increases in all our businesses."
Walter added, "For the third quarter of 2008, we anticipate continued strong commercial performance in all segments, particularly Industrial Chemicals, with earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share."
FMC will conduct its second quarter conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, 2008. This event will be available live and as a replay on the web at .
