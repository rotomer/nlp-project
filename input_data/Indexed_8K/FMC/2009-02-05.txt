FMC Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter 2008 Results
 
 
 FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today reported net income of $46.3 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008, versus net income of $40.9 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $29.1 million after-tax, or charges of $0.39 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $4.3 million after-tax, or charges of $0.06 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items in both periods, the company earned $1.02 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 73 percent versus $0.59 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter revenue of $737.7 million increased 9 percent versus $674.3 million in the prior year.
PHILADELPHIA, February 4, 2009
William G. Walter, FMC chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "Our record fourth quarter performance resulted from higher sales and earnings across all three segments. Agricultural Products' results were driven by increased sales in Latin America and North America. Specialty Chemicals benefited from higher sales in both BioPolymer and lithium and the full-quarter inclusion of the recent alginates and food ingredients acquisitions. Industrial Chemicals' exceptional performance was due to higher selling prices in soda ash and phosphates. Our record performance was achieved despite the rapid deterioration of global economic conditions in the quarter."

Revenue in Agricultural Products of $240.8 million was 5 percent higher than the prior-year quarter, as sales increases were realized in Latin America and North America. Segment earnings of $33.6 million also increased 5 percent versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting the sales growth in the Americas and favorable mix, mostly offset by higher raw material and distribution costs.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $190.3 million, an increase of 18 percent versus the prior-year quarter. Strong commercial performance in BioPolymer, the full-quarter inclusion of the ISP acquisition and volume growth in lithium primaries were the drivers of top line growth. Segment earnings of $35.1 million increased 3 percent versus the year-ago quarter, as the higher sales were largely offset by higher raw material and energy costs and export taxes in Argentina.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $308.0 million, an increase of 8 percent from the prior-year quarter. Higher selling prices were achieved in all businesses, particularly in soda ash and phosphates. Segment earnings of $53.3 million increased 85 percent versus the year-ago quarter, as the higher sales and improved power market conditions in Spain more than offset higher raw material costs.
Corporate expense was $12.3 million, down from $12.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense, net, was $7.4 million, as compared to $7.9 million in the year-ago quarter. On December 31, 2008, gross consolidated debt was $623.6 million, and debt, net of cash, was $571.2 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $29.9 million and capital expenditures were $48.9 million.

Full-Year Results
Revenue was $3,115.3 million, an increase of 18 percent as compared with $2,632.9 million in the prior year. Net income was $304.6 million, up 130 percent from $132.4 million in the year-earlier period. Net income in the current year included restructuring and other income and charges of $46.5 million, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $107.3 million in the prior year. Excluding these charges, the company earned $351.1 million in the current year, an increase of 46 percent versus $239.7 million in the prior year.
Revenue in Agricultural Products was $1,058.7 million, an increase of 19 percent versus the prior year. Sales gains were achieved in all regions and benefited from favorable global agrochemical market conditions, increased planted acres in key crops and new product introductions. Segment earnings were $245.2 million, an increase of 18 percent from the prior year as a result of the higher sales and continued global supply chain productivity improvements, which more than offset higher raw material costs.
Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $764.5 million, an increase of 16 percent versus the prior year, driven by strong commercial performance in BioPolymer and lithium specialties. Segment earnings of $152.0 million increased 7 percent versus the year earlier as a result of the higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs and export taxes in Argentina.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $1,296.9 million, an increase of 19 percent versus the prior year. Higher selling prices were realized across the segment, particularly in soda ash and phosphates. Segment earnings of $201.4 million increased 118 percent versus the prior year, as the higher sales and improved power market conditions in Spain more than offset higher raw material costs.

Corporate expense was $49.8 million, as compared to $52.3 million in the prior year. Interest expense, net, was $31.9 million, down from $34.9 million in the prior year. For the year, depreciation and amortization was $124.2 million, capital expenditures were $174.8 million and spending on acquisitions was $90.6 million net of acquired cash.
Outlook
Regarding the outlook for 2009, Walter said, "Despite a difficult and uncertain global economic environment, we expect to deliver another year of strong performance. For the full year 2009, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $4.60 to $5.00 per diluted share.
"For the first quarter of 2009, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $1.15 to $1.30 per diluted share. In Agricultural Products, we look for earnings growth of 5-10 percent, driven by higher sales across most regions and continued global supply chain improvements, partially offset by spending on growth initiatives. In Specialty Chemicals, we expect earnings to be flat to up 5 percent as higher sales are largely offset by higher raw material and energy costs. In Industrial Chemicals, earnings are expected to be down 10-20 percent, as higher selling prices across the segment are more than offset by lower volumes and higher raw material and other input costs."
FMC will conduct its fourth quarter conference call and webcast at 11:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, February 5, 2009. This event will be available live and as a replay on the web at . Prior to the conference call, the company will also provide supplemental information on the web including its 2009 Outlook Statement, definitions of non-GAAP terms and reconciliations of non-GAAP figures to the nearest available GAAP term.

In addition to the line item "Restructuring and other charges (income)" as presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and discussed in detail below, the line item in the above reconciliation includes the following:
 
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2008, restructuring and other charges (income) include continued charges related to the closure of our Baltimore agricultural chemicals facility ($9.2 million) and our Jacksonville, Florida agricultural formulation plant ($0.8 million). Both of these charges are associated with our Agricultural Products segment. We also incurred charges related to legal proceedings in our Industrial Chemicals segment ($10.0 million). Additionally, remaining restructuring and other charges (income) for the three months ended December 31, 2008 primarily include restructuring related severance charges in our Industrial Chemicals segment ($1.4 million), asset abandonment charges in our Agricultural Products segment and Industrial Chemicals segment ($1.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively) and charges associated with continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge ($5.8 million).
For the year ended December 31, 2008, restructuring and other charges (income) include a net gain associated with the sale of our major research and development facility in Princeton, New Jersey ($29.0 million-gain) and a gain associated with the sale of our sodium sulfate assets in Foret which is part of our Industrial Chemicals segment ($3.6 million-gain). Fully offsetting these gains were continued charges related to the closure of our Baltimore agricultural chemicals facility ($31.5 million) and Jacksonville agricultural formulation facility ($5.6 million). We also incurred charges related to legal proceedings in our Industrial Chemicals segment ($10.0 million). Additionally, we incurred charges associated with continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge ($16.2 million), restructuring related severance charges in our Agricultural Products segment and Industrial Chemicals segment ($3.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively) and asset abandonment charges in our Agricultural Products segment ($2.2 million), our Industrial Chemicals segment ($1.5 million) and our Specialty Chemicals segment ($3.3 million).
In addition to the line item "Restructuring and other charges (income)" as presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and discussed in detail below, this line item in the above reconciliation includes the following:
 
 
 
Restructuring and other charges (income) for the three months ended December 31, 2007 primarily include continued charges related to the closure of our Baltimore agricultural chemicals facility ($15.0 million), charges associated with continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge ($4.0 million) and severance charges in our Industrial Chemicals segment ($1.8 million).
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, restructuring and other charges (income) primarily include charges related to the closure of our Baltimore facility ($104.9 million), charges associated with the asset abandonment of one of our Foret co-generation facilities which is part of our Industrial Chemicals segment ($8.2 million before minority interest) and charges related to the settlement of all claims with Solutia and Astaris (now known as Siratsa) regarding our contribution of PPA technology to the Astaris joint venture in our Industrial Chemicals segment ($22.5 million). Remaining charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 primarily include the Foret impairment charges due to the commitment to the abandonment of certain fixed assets ($4.0 million) as well as charges associated with continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge ($10.2 million) and severance costs ($6.8 million) primarily in our Industrial Chemicals segment.
(c) Amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 represents loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the Domestic credit agreement which replaced the 2005 credit agreement. The loss represents the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with our previous credit agreements.
(d) Tax adjustments for the three months ended December 31, 2008 are primarily related to adjustments to valuation allowances and deferred income taxes related to prior year tax matters. Tax adjustments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 are primarily related to reductions to our tax liabilities due to favorable conclusions to tax audits.
Tax adjustments for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2007 mainly include tax benefits related to the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances. These allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets are now likely to be realized. Partially offsetting these valuation adjustments are charges associated with adjustments to deferred income taxes and other adjustments related to prior year tax matters.
 
 
Amounts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 related to Agricultural Products ($43.9 million), Industrial Chemicals ($15.6 million), Specialty Chemicals ($6.7 million) and Corporate ($12.9 million-gain). Amounts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 related to Agricultural Products ($108.3 million), Industrial Chemicals ($41.5 million), Specialty Chemicals ($3.1 million) and Corporate ($4.1 million).
