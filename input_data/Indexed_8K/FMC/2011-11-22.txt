FMC Corporation Completes $300 Million Debt Offering; Announces Share Repurchases
PHILADELPHIA, November 22, 2011
- FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC) today announced that it has completed the sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.95% Senior Notes due February 1, 2022, in an underwritten registered public offering. The offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement FMC filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2010, and a prospectus supplement filed on November 17, 2011, in which FMC stated its intention to use the net proceeds from this offering to pay down existing indebtedness under its revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes, including its stock repurchase program.
Pierre Brondeau, FMC's president, chief executive officer and chairman, said, This offering underscores our continued intent to generate significant value for our investors as we implement our strategic plan for the next five years, Vision 2015. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering to fund internal growth opportunities and acquisitions, and to reward our investors with additional liquidity through share repurchases - all key elements of Vision 2015.
Brondeau continued, With the offering now completed, we are commencing the repurchase of approximately $200 million of our shares under our previously announced share repurchase program, accelerating the timing from the original plan for these repurchases to occur in 2012. We expect to complete the repurchases by the end of March 2012.
