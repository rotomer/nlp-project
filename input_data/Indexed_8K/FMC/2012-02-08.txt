FMC Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter 2011 Results
PHILADELPHIA, February 8, 2012
- FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) today reported net income of $77.9 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2011, versus a net loss of $53.5 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net income in the current quarter included restructuring and other income and charges of $33.7 million after-tax, or charges of $0.48 per diluted share, versus restructuring and other income and charges of $133.2 million after-tax, or charges of $1.84 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these items in both periods, the company earned $1.58 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 44 percent versus $1.10 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $908.6 million increased 17 percent excluding the prior-year impact of exited businesses.
Pierre Brondeau, FMC president, chief executive officer and chairman, said, Our fourth quarter results provided a strong finish to a year of remarkable accomplishment for FMC. We achieved record financial performance in 2011 and made great progress implementing our Vision 2015 strategic plan. Agricultural Products achieved its eighth consecutive year of record earnings. Specialty Chemicals achieved its sixth consecutive year of record earnings, led by the seventh consecutive year of record earnings in BioPolymer. Industrial Chemicals delivered robust earnings growth, reflecting the strength of our soda ash business and our continued shift toward specialty peroxygens.

We also benefited in 2011 from the achievement of a 26.3 percent tax rate, considerably lower than our prior guidance of 29 percent. As we continue to increase our presence in rapidly developing economies, both in sourcing our
products and in revenues, our overall tax rate has reduced to a new level. With our plans to continue to invest in these economies, we expect this lower tax rate to be a sustaining contributor to our higher earnings profile. For context, if we were to recalibrate our fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $1.58 per diluted share using the prior guidance tax rate and associated higher duty costs, our adjusted earnings would have been $1.37 per diluted share. For 2012, we are projecting a 27 percent tax rate. said Brondeau.
Brondeau continued, As we look back on 2011, I am pleased to report that we made great progress implementing Vision 2015, our plan to raise our growth trajectory and translate that growth to increased shareholder value through sustained high profitability and return on capital, coupled with disciplined cash deployment. Key performance metrics are on or above trend line toward realizing our Vision 2015 objectives. We made focused investments in organic growth and external initiatives that build on our strong portfolio and raise our growth profile. Alongside these investments, we returned $206 million to shareholders in 2011 in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.
Fourth Quarter Results
    
Revenue in Agricultural Products of $409.2 million increased 22 percent versus the prior-year quarter, led by robust sales growth in Latin America. The sales gains in Latin America were driven by strong demand for productivity enhancing inputs in Brazil, as well as new product introductions and sales from our new joint venture in Argentina. In EMEA, sales increased significantly based on the strength of insecticide and herbicide sales in Europe. In North America, sales were lower than a year ago due to a shift in the timing of fall application sales. In Asia, sales were essentially level to a year ago as higher insecticide volumes in China, Indonesia and Korea were offset by lower herbicide volumes, as less favorable weather conditions impacted the region's wheat crops. Segment earnings of $72.6 million increased 17 percent versus a year ago driven by the higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material and manufacturing costs, as well as increased spending on targeted organic and external growth initiatives.

Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $222.6 million, up 9 percent versus the year-ago quarter driven primarily by higher selling prices across the segment and volume growth in food ingredients, pharmaceutical excipients and lithium specialties. In BioPolymer, sales gains resulted from higher selling prices and volume gains across the business. Lithium sales growth reflected higher selling prices in both lithium primaries and specialties and volume gains in energy storage and synthesis markets. Segment earnings of $51.2 million were 11 percent higher than the prior-year quarter driven by the sales gains and favorable mix, which more than offset higher raw material costs and spending on targeted organic and external growth initiatives.
Revenue in Industrial Chemicals of $277.1 million increased 14 percent excluding the prior-year impact of exited businesses, reflecting higher selling prices for soda ash and peroxygens and volume gains in soda ash resulting from the startup of our Granger facility earlier in the year. In soda ash, higher volumes and selling prices in export markets were the primary drivers of the sales gain. In Peroxygens, higher selling prices were realized in all product lines. Segment earnings of $42.0 million increased 47 percent versus the year-ago quarter as a result of the broad-based sales gains and continued favorable mix shift toward specialty peroxygens.
Corporate expense was $17.3 million as compared to $20.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense, net, was $9.9 million versus $10.3 million in the year-ago quarter. On December 31, 2011, gross consolidated debt was $825.6 million, and debt, net of cash, was $666.7 million. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $70.4 million and depreciation and amortization was $32.3 million
.
Outlook
Regarding the outlook for 2012, Brondeau said, We plan to deliver another record year in 2012 with full-year adjusted earnings of $6.70 to $7.05 per diluted share, a 15 percent increase above last year at the midpoint of this range.

Our Agricultural Products segment expects to achieve its ninth straight year of record earnings, up approximately 10 percent versus the prior year due to expected strong market conditions and growth in new and recently introduced products while increasing spending on growth initiatives. Our Specialty Chemicals segment plans to deliver its seventh straight year of record earnings, up approximately 10 percent versus last year, reflecting higher sales across all businesses. And in Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to increase approximately 20 percent driven by higher volumes and selling prices across the segment and the continued mix shift toward specialty peroxygens, said Brondeau.
Brondeau concluded, For the first quarter of 2012, we anticipate adjusted earnings of $1.70 to $1.90 per diluted share, a 21 percent increase over last year at the midpoint of this range. Agricultural Products' segment earnings are expected to be up approximately 20 percent, reflecting robust early season demand in North America coupled with the expected shift of some sales in the region from the second quarter, a strong finish to the crop season in Brazil and volume gains in Asia and EMEA. Specialty Chemicals' segment earnings are expected to be level to a year ago, as higher selling prices across all BioPolymer and lithium product lines are offset by higher raw material, energy and operating costs associated with our lithium capacity expansion in Argentina and BioPolymer alginates expansion in Norway. And in Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to increase approximately 10 percent driven by higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygens, the benefit of volume growth in soda ash export markets and the continued mix shift toward specialty peroxygens.

___________________
* The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted After-Tax Earnings from Continuing Operations, Attributable to FMC Stockholders, and its presentation on a per share basis, provides useful information about the Companys operating results to investor and securities analysts. Adjusted earnings excludes the effects of restructuring and other charges and income, non-operating retirement-related costs, acquisition related charges and tax related adjustments. The Company also believes that excluding the effects of these items from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying businesses from period to period. Additionally, the above schedule is presented in a format which reflects the manner in which we manage our business and is not in accordance with GAAP.
Please see the reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial results.

a part of our Industrial Chemicals segment. We also incurred charges associated with continuing environmental sites ($3.1 million). Remaining restructuring and other charges (income) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, include net miscellaneous charges of ($4.6 million) related to our Specialty Chemical segment ($2.2 million), our Industrial Chemicals segment ($1.4 million), our Agricultural Products segment ($1.2 million) and Corporate ($0.2 million-gain).
2010:
Restructuring and other charges (income) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, include charges from the restructuring activities associated with our Huelva, Spain facility, which is part of our Industrial Chemicals segment ($110.4 million), charges associated with our Alginates manufacturing operations in our Specialty Chemicals segment ($1.1 million) and severance charges related to other restructuring activities in Agricultural Products, Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemical segment ($0.6 million, $2.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively). Offsetting these charges is income from the sale of land lease rights related to our Barcelona, Spain, facility, which is part of our Industrial Chemicals segment ($3.7 million-gain). We also incurred charges associated with continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge ($4.5 million). Remaining restructuring and other charges (income) for the three months ended December 31, 2010, include miscellaneous charges of $0.6 million.
Restructuring and other charges (income) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, include charges from the restructuring activities associated with our Huelva, Spain facility ($110.4 million) and net charges related to the closure of our manufacturing operations at our Barcelona, Spain, facility ($6.9 million), both of which are part of our Industrial Chemicals segment, the realignment of our Alginates manufacturing operations in our Specialty Chemicals segment ($7.2 million) and primarily severance charges related to other restructuring activities in Agricultural Products, Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemical segment ($0.6 million, $4.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively). We also incurred charges associated with continuing environmental sites as a Corporate charge ($14.2 million). Remaining restructuring and other charges (income) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, include charges associated with certain rights acquired for an herbicide compound still under development in our Agricultural Products segment ($5.7 million), charges related to a legal settlement in our Industrial Chemicals segment ($1.5 million) and other miscellaneous net charges of $1.2 million.
(c) Our non-operating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. These costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. We exclude these non-operating pension and postretirement costs as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses, provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances period-over-period comparability. We continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our Adjusted Earnings results noted above. We believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees.
(d) Charges related to the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of purchase accounting. The charges for year ended December 31, 2011 relate to a number of acquisitions completed in 2011. On the consolidated statements of income, the charges are included in Costs of sales and services. No such charges occurred for the year ended December 31, 2010.
(e) Tax adjustments for the three months ended December 31, 2011 are primarily the result of an increase to our valuation allowance related to foreign operations for tax losses not expected to be fully recoverable in future years. Tax adjustments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, are primarily a result of a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements of audits mostly offset by the valuation allowance increases recorded in the fourth quarter. Tax adjustments for the three months ended December 31, 2010, are primarily a result of valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets in Spain, that arose principally from the Huelva shutdown. Tax adjustments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, are primarily the result of the tax adjustments noted for the three months ended December 31, 2010, as well as a charge associated with a change in the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D subsidy which was enacted as part of the recent U.S. health care reform legislation. This charge was partially offset by a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements of audits and expiration of statute of limitations.
