Mr. Graves, age 41, comes to FMC from Goldman Sachs & Company, where he has worked since 2000, most recently as partner (since 2008) and managing director (since 2006). Mr. Graves began his career at Ernst & Young in 1993 in the audit practice before moving to British Sky Broadcasting Group as an internal auditor. He moved into investment banking in 1998 where he held positions of increasing responsibility at London-based ING Barings and J. Henry Schroder & Company. Mr. Graves earned his bachelor of arts in Accounting and Finance from Nottingham Trent University, and qualified as a Chartered Accountant (ACA) with Ernst & Young.
Employment Letter with Paul Graves
In connection with Mr. Graves' hiring, the Company's board of directors approved an employment letter with Mr. Graves providing for his employment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective October 1, 2012. The employment letter provides for an initial annual base salary of $600,000, which will be reviewed annually beginning February 2013. Mr. Graves is also eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus with a target amount equal to 60% of his base salary and maximum payout of 120% of his base salary, based upon the achievement of corporate and individual performance goals established by the compensation committee of the board of directors.
Upon the commencement of his employment, Mr. Graves will receive a sign-on bonus in the form of a restricted stock unit grant with respect to a number of shares of FMC common stock having a value equal to the Goldman Sachs restricted stock award that Mr. Graves will forfeit as a result of joining the Company, estimated at $1,156,000. These FMC restricted stock units will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, provided Mr. Graves remains employed through that date.
Under the letter, in February 2013, Mr. Graves will be eligible to receive long-term incentive awards valued at a target amount of $843,000, as calculated on the February 2013 grant date, under the Company's Incentive Compensation and Stock Plan. These long-term incentive awards are expected to be comprised of one-third stock options, one-third restricted stock units and one-third performance based cash award. The stock options and restricted stock unit grants will vest on the third anniversary of the February 2013 grant date, provided Mr. Graves remains employed through that date. The performance-based cash award will be determined by the compensation committee based upon the relative return to shareholders of the Company versus that of the Company's established peer group over a three-year period.
Mr. Graves will be entitled to executive fringe benefits comparable to those of other FMC executive officers as described in the Company's annual proxy statement, and he will be entitled to participate in the Company's executive long-term disability program, as well as employee benefit plans (other than the defined benefit plans) and programs.

Business Group Presidents
PHILADELPHIA, September 17, 2012
- FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) today announced several executive leadership changes. Paul Graves, who was previously partner and managing director at Goldman Sachs Group, has been appointed executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective October 1, 2012. He will succeed Kim Foster, FMC executive vice president and CFO, who will retire at the end of the year. Mark Douglas has been appointed president of the Agricultural Products Group, succeeding Milton Steele, who will retire in early 2013; and Ed Flynn has been promoted to president of the Industrial Chemicals Group, succeeding Mark Douglas. Graves, Douglas, and Flynn will report to Pierre Brondeau, FMC president, CEO and chairman.
Paul brings significant finance experience to FMC, and is an excellent addition to our executive team, said Brondeau. He is a dynamic, global leader who's worked in Europe, Asia, and the U.S., and brings to FMC tremendous experience in the chemicals and agriculture sectors, having served as the global head of those sectors in Goldman's Investment Banking Division.
Graves began his career in investment banking in 1997 in London, and joined Goldman Sachs' Investment Banking Division in 2000. He moved to Goldman Sachs' Hong Kong office in 2010 where he was named co-head of Natural Resources for Asia (excluding Japan). In addition, Graves was the global head of the Chemicals sector since 2005, and global head of the Agriculture sector. He was promoted to managing director of Goldman Sachs in 2006 and partner in 2008.

FMC Corporation Announces New CFO, Appointment of New Business Group Presidents
Mark Douglas, president of the Industrial Chemicals Group, has been named president of the Agricultural Products Group, effective October 1, 2012.
Mark brings nearly 25 years of chemical industry experience and leadership to our Agricultural Products Group, said Brondeau. He's a seasoned executive with exceptional global, commercial, and corporate experience. Mark will take the reins of our highly successful agricultural business, and will work closely with the business's veteran leadership team to continue driving its unique growth strategy.
Douglas joined FMC in 2010 as vice president of Global Services and International Development. Prior to FMC, he held a variety of commercial, research, regional, and global roles in the chemical industry, including leadership positions at Rohm and Haas Company and The Dow Chemical Company. In addition to leading FMC Agricultural Products Group, Douglas will retain executive oversight for the Latin America Region and the Procurement organization.
Ed Flynn, manager for the Alkali Chemicals Division, will succeed Mark Douglas as president of the Industrial Chemicals Group, effective October 1, 2012.
Ed is a 31-year FMC veteran who is uniquely qualified to lead our Industrial Chemicals Group, said Brondeau. During the last decade, he has been responsible for FMC's highly efficient soda ash business, including the world's largest natural soda ash production facility. He's a respected industry executive, and we're pleased to have the caliber of leadership I know Ed will bring to this important role.
Flynn has held a variety of engineering, manufacturing, functional, and business roles of increasing responsibility at several FMC locations during his career. He was promoted to division manager for Alkali Chemicals in 2002, where he has been a champion of the business's successful low-cost model.

In addition to these executive changes, the company announced that Michael Wilson, president of the Specialty Chemicals Group, will add to his business responsibilities executive oversight for the company's Asia Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe and Turkey regions. Wilson will retain executive responsibility for Sustainability.
Brondeau praised the significant and lasting contributions of Foster and Steele, who joined FMC in 1978 and 1977, respectively. Kim and Milton have been exceptional leaders throughout their FMC careers. Kim has been the company's steady hand in sound fiscal management since he was named CFO in 2001. His business savvy and financial acumen have delivered more than 20 percent total shareholder return and 16 percent compounded annual growth in earnings per share since 2001, among the best in the chemical industry, Brondeau said.
Milton's contribution to the long-term success of our Agricultural Products Group has been equally impressive. He is the principal architect of the business's unique innovation and virtual manufacturing strategy, and has presided over a remarkable period of sustained global business growth, including eight consecutive years of record sales and earnings, Brondeau said. We thank both of these members of the FMC family for their lasting contributions, and wish them continued health and happiness in their retirements.
