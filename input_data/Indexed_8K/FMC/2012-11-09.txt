Amendment of Brondeau Offer Letter
On November 6, 2012, FMC Corporation (the "") and its Chief Executive Officer, Pierre Brondeau, entered into an amendment (the "") of his employment offer letter dated October 23, 2009 (the ""). The Amendment clarifies Mr. Brondeau's severance rights under the Offer Letter and specifies the treatment of outstanding long-term incentive awards held by Mr. Brondeau if his employment ceases under specified circumstances as follows:
Company
Amendment
Offer Letter
1. Severance benefits are now conditioned on Mr. Brondeau's execution of a general release of claims.
2. The Offer Letter's description of the impact of resignation after the attainment of age 62 with 10 or more years of service (a "") on Mr. Brondeau's long-term incentive awards is expanded to substantially parallel the 62/10 Retirement provisions of long-term incentive awards granted by the Company in the ordinary course.
62/10 Retirement
Specifically, upon a 62/10 Retirement: (a) outstanding stock options vest, (b) the post-termination exercise period of stock options is extended until the earlier of the end of the option term or the fifth anniversary of retirement, (c) outstanding time-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units vest, and (d) subject to compliance with restrictive covenants, the executive remains eligible to earn a pro-rata portion of performance-based cash awards based on actual corporate performance through the end of the applicable performance period.
3. Any cessation of Mr. Brondeau's service after both December 31, 2015 and the Board's approval of a "definitive succession plan" will have the same impact on long-term incentive awards as a 62/10 Retirement, as described above. For this purpose, a "definitive succession plan" means a succession plan identifying the new Chief Executive Officer, the timing of succession, any related and material changes in titles, duties or reporting lines for other key personnel and an integration plan for the transition of duties. The Board retains sole and absolute discretion regarding whether and when to approve any succession plan.
Restatement of Executive Severance Agreements
On November 6, 2012, the Company entered into an Executive Severance Agreement with Paul Graves and Amended and Restated Executive Severance Agreements with each of its other Named Executive Officers (collectively, the ""). For Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Graves, the Restated Agreements replace Executive Severance Agreements previously entered into between the Company and those Named Executive Officers. The Restated Agreements differ from the prior Executive Severance Agreements in the following respects:
Restated Agreements
1. The next opportunity for the Company to terminate the Restated Agreements unilaterally will be December 31, 2015 (as opposed to December 31, 2013 for the prior agreements). After December 31, 2015, the Company will have an annual opportunity to decide whether to renew the agreements.
2. The definition of "Good Reason" is revised to limit this potential severance trigger to events occurring proximate to a change in control and to give the Company notice and an opportunity to cure events that would otherwise be a basis for an employee to resign and receive severance benefits.
3. All severance benefits are now conditioned on the employee's execution of a general release of claims.
4. Severance benefits include a multiple of the sum of the employee's base salary plus a bonus component. The bonus component was previously the greater of the employee's target annual bonus or the employee's average actual bonus for the two preceding years. As revised, the bonus component is now simply the target annual bonus. This change is intended to reduce severance benefits payable under these agreements.
5. Severance benefits also include a pro-rata annual bonus for the year of termination. Previously, the pro-rata bonus was based on the target amount of the employee's annual bonus. As revised, the pro-rata bonus is payable based on actual performance through the end of the year of termination. This may result in a higher or lower pro-rata bonus than the earlier formulation, but this approach creates a greater linkage to actual performance.
The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entireties by reference to the full texts of the Amendment and the Restated Agreements, which are filed as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Description of Severance Benefits

(f) For a period of three (3) full years following the Date of Separation from Service, the Company shall provide medical insurance for the Executive (and the Executive's covered spouse and dependents) at the same premium cost, and at the same coverage level, as in effect as of the date of the Change in Control.

In addition, for purposes of benefit calculation only under the Company's nonqualified retirement plans with respect to benefits that have not been paid prior to such Change in Control, it will be assumed that the Executive's employment continued following the Date of Separation from Service for three (3) full years (i.e., three (3) additional years of age and service credits will be added); provided, however, that for purposes of determining "final average pay" under such programs, the Executive's actual pay history as of the Date of Separation from Service will be used.

Termination for Disability
3.5. . If the Executive's employment is terminated due to death, the Executive's benefits will be determined in accordance with the Company's retirement, survivor's benefits, insurance and other applicable programs of the Company then in effect.

Termination for Cause, or Other Than for Good Reason
 
3.7. . Any termination of employment by the Company or by the Executive for Good Reason will be communicated by a Notice of Termination.
Notice of Termination

(c) the benefits due under Sections 3.3(e) and 3.3(f) will continue uninterrupted following the Executive's Separation from Service (but will be discontinued if the requirements of Section 4.2 are not timely satisfied).
4.2. . All rights, payments and benefits due to the Executive under Section 3.3 (other than Section 3.3(c)) shall be conditioned on the Executive's execution of a general release of claims against the Company and its affiliates in a form reasonably prescribed by the Company and on that release becoming irrevocable within 30 days following the Termination Date.
Release
Article 5. Taxes and Tax Compliance
5.1. . The Company will be entitled to withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all taxes as it may believe are reasonably required to be withheld (including, without limitation, any United States federal taxes and any other state, city, or local taxes).
Withholding of Taxes

Reg.  1.409A-1(b)) that is otherwise required to be made to the Executive prior to the day after the date that is six months from the Date of Separation from Service shall be accumulated, deferred and paid in a lump sum to the Executive (with interest on the amount deferred from the Date of Separation from Service until the day prior to the actual payment at the federal short-term rate on the Date of Separation from Service) on the day after the date that is six months from the Date of Separation from Service; provided, however, if Executive dies prior to the expiration of such six month period, payment to the Executive's Beneficiary shall be made as soon as practicable following the Executive's death. Any reimbursements or in-kind benefits that constitute a deferral of compensation (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)) will be provided subject to the requirements of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv)(A)(3), (4) and (5).
Section 409A Compliance
 
Article 6. Establishment of Trust
The Company has created a domestic Trust (which will be a grantor trust within the meaning of Sections 671-678 of the Code) for the benefit of the Executive and Beneficiaries. The Trust has a Trustee selected by the Company, and has certain restrictions as to the Company's ability to amend the Trust or cancel benefits provided thereunder. Any assets contained in the Trust will, at all times, be specifically subject to the claims of the Company's general creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency.
At any time following the Effective Date hereof, the Company may, but is not obligated to, deposit assets in the Trust in an amount equal to or less than the aggregate Severance Benefits which may become due to the Executive under Sections 3.3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Agreement.
As soon as practicable after the Company has knowledge that a Change in Control is imminent, but no later than the day immediately preceding the date of the Change in Control, the Company will deposit assets in such Trust in an amount equal to the estimated aggregate Severance Benefits which may become due to the Executive under Sections 3.3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Agreement. Such deposited amounts will be reviewed and increased, if necessary, every six (6) months following a Change in Control to reflect the Executive's estimated aggregate Severance Benefits at such time.
Article 7. The Company's Payment Obligation
The Company's obligation to make the payments and the arrangements provided for herein will be absolute and unconditional, and will not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any offset, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which the Company may have against the Executive or anyone else. All amounts payable by the Company hereunder will be paid without notice or demand. Each and every payment made hereunder by the Company will be final, and the Company will not seek to recover all or any part of such payment from the Executive or from whomsoever may be entitled thereto, for any reasons whatsoever.
The Executive will not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the amounts payable or arrangements made under any provision of this Agreement, and the obtaining of any such other employment will in no event effect any reduction of the Company's obligations to make the payments and arrangements required to be made under this Agreement, except to the extent provided in Sections 3.3(e) and (f) herein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Severance Benefits are paid under this Agreement, no severance benefits under any program of the Company, other than benefits described in this Agreement, will be paid to the Executive.
Article 8. Fees and Expenses
To the extent permitted by law, the Company will pay as incurred (within ten (10) days following receipt of an invoice from the Executive) all legal fees, costs of litigation, prejudgment interest, and other expenses incurred in good faith by the Executive as a result of the Company's refusal to provide the Severance Benefits to which the Executive becomes entitled under this Agreement, or as a result of the Company's contesting the validity, enforceability, or
 
interpretation of this Agreement, or as a result of any conflict between the parties pertaining to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company will reimburse the Executive only for such expenses arising out of litigation commenced within three years following the Executive's Separation from Service. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article 8, the Company will reimburse the Executive only for expenses incurred prior to the end of the fifth year following the Executive's Separation from Service.
Article 9. Outplacement Assistance
Following a Qualifying Termination (as described in Section 3.2 herein), the Executive will be reimbursed by the Company for the costs of all reasonable outplacement services obtained by the Executive within the two (2) year period after the Date of Separation from Service; provided, however, that reimbursements must be made by the end of the third year following the Date of Separation from Service and the total reimbursement for such outplacement services will be limited to an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Executive's Base Salary as of the Date of Separation from Service.
Article 10. Successors and Assignment
10.1. . The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company or of any division or subsidiary thereof to expressly assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform them if no such succession had taken place.
Successors to the Company
10.2. . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive dies while any amount would still be payable to him hereunder had he continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, will be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's Beneficiary. If the Executive has not named a Beneficiary, then such amounts will be paid to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other designee, or if there is no such designee, to the Executive's estate, and such designee, or the Executive's estate will be treated as the Beneficiary hereunder.
Assignment by the Executive
Article 11. Miscellaneous
11.1. . Except as may be provided under any other agreement between the Executive and the Company, the employment of the Executive by the Company is "at will," and may be terminated by either the Executive or the Company at any time, subject to applicable law.
Employment Status
11.2. . The Executive may designate one or more persons or entities as the primary and/or contingent Beneficiaries of any Severance Benefits owing to the Executive under this Agreement. Such designation must be in the form of a signed writing acceptable to the Committee. The Executive may make or change such designations at any time.
Beneficiaries
 
11.3. . In the event any provision of this Agreement will be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity will not affect the remaining parts of the Agreement, and the Agreement will be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. Further, the captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and will have no force and effect.
Severability

The Executive will not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the amounts payable or arrangements made under any provision of this Agreement, and the obtaining of any such other employment will in no event effect any reduction of the Company's obligations to make the payments and arrangements required to be made under this Agreement, except to the extent provided in Sections 3.3(e) and (f) herein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Severance Benefits are paid under this Agreement, no severance benefits under any program of the Company, other than benefits described in this Agreement, will be paid to the Executive.

Successors to the Company
10.2. . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees.

If the Executive has not named a Beneficiary, then such amounts will be paid to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other designee, or if there is no such designee, to the Executive's estate, and such designee, or the Executive's estate will be treated as the Beneficiary hereunder.

Any reimbursements or in-kind benefits that constitute a deferral of compensation (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)) will be provided subject to the requirements of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv)(A)(3), (4) and (5).
Section 409A Compliance
 
5.3. .
Excise Tax Equalization Payment
(a) If the Executive (or the Executive's Beneficiary, if applicable) becomes entitled to Severance Benefits or any other payment or benefit under this Agreement, or under any other agreement with or plan of the Company as a result of the Executive's Separation from Service (in the aggregate, the "Total Payments"), if all or any part of the Total Payments will be subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed), (the "Excise Tax") the Company will pay to the Executive in cash an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive after deduction of any Excise Tax upon the Total Payments and any federal, state, and local income taxes, penalties, interest, and Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment provided for by this Section 5.3(a) (including FICA and FUTA), will be equal to the Total Payments.
(b) All determinations of whether any of the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, the amounts of such Excise Tax, whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be used in arriving at such determinations, shall be made by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm that does not serve as an accountant or auditor for any individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control as designated by the Company (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm will provide detailed supporting calculations to the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive or the Company requesting a calculation hereunder. The Gross-Up Payment will be made by the Company to the Executive as soon as practical following the Accounting Firm's determination of the Gross-Up Payment, but in no event beyond thirty (30) days from the Date of Separation from Service. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be paid by the Company.
(c) For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive will be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made, and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence on the Date of Separation from Service, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.
(d) If the Internal Revenue Service adjusts the computations to be made pursuant to Section 5.3(b), and as a result of such adjustment the Gross-Up Payment made to the Executive is less than the greatest Gross-Up Payment that the Executive is entitled to receive under Section 5.3(b), the Company will pay to the Executive an amount equal to the difference between the greatest Gross-Up Payment the Executive is entitled to receive, and the Gross-Up Payment initially made to the Executive, plus interest at the federal short-term rate, compounded annually, on the date the first Gross-Up Payment is made, for the period commencing on the date the first Gross-Up Payment is made, and ending on the day immediately preceding the date the subsequent Gross-Up Payment is made (the "Excess Payment"). The Excess Payment must be made by the end of the year in which the Internal Revenue Service adjusts the computations made pursuant to Section 5.3(b).
 
Article 6. Establishment of Trust
The Company has created a domestic Trust (which will be a grantor trust within the meaning of Sections 671-678 of the Code) for the benefit of the Executive and Beneficiaries. The Trust has a Trustee selected by the Company, and has certain restrictions as to the Company's ability to amend the Trust or cancel benefits provided thereunder. Any assets contained in the Trust will, at all times, be specifically subject to the claims of the Company's general creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency.

As soon as practicable after the Company has knowledge that a Change in Control is imminent, but no later than the day immediately preceding the date of the Change in Control, the Company will deposit assets in such Trust in an amount equal to the estimated aggregate Severance Benefits which may become due to the Executive under Sections 3.3 (a), (b), (c) and (d) and 5.3(a) of this Agreement. Such deposited amounts will be reviewed and increased, if necessary, every six (6) months following a Change in Control to reflect the Executive's estimated aggregate Severance Benefits at such time.
Article 7. The Company's Payment Obligation
The Company's obligation to make the payments and the arrangements provided for herein will be absolute and unconditional, and will not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any offset, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which the Company may have against the Executive or anyone else. All amounts payable by the Company hereunder will be paid without notice or demand. Each and every payment made hereunder by the Company will be final, and the Company will not seek to recover all or any part of such payment from the Executive or from whomsoever may be entitled thereto, for any reasons whatsoever.
The Executive will not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the amounts payable or arrangements made under any provision of this Agreement, and the obtaining of any such other employment will in no event effect any reduction of the Company's obligations to make the payments and arrangements required to be made under this Agreement, except to the extent provided in Sections 3.3(e) and (f) herein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Severance Benefits are paid under this Agreement, no severance benefits under any program of the Company, other than benefits described in this Agreement, will be paid to the Executive.
Article 8. Fees and Expenses
To the extent permitted by law, the Company will pay as incurred (within ten (10) days following receipt of an invoice from the Executive) all legal fees, costs of litigation, prejudgment interest, and other expenses incurred in good faith by the Executive as a result of the Company's refusal to provide the Severance Benefits to which the Executive becomes entitled under this Agreement, or as a result of the Company's contesting the validity, enforceability, or
 
interpretation of this Agreement, or as a result of any conflict (including, without limitation, conflicts related to the calculations under Section 5.3 hereof) between the parties pertaining to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company will reimburse the Executive only for such expenses arising out of litigation commenced within three years following the Executive's Separation from Service. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article 8, the Company will reimburse the Executive only for expenses incurred prior to the end of the fifth year following the Executive's Separation from Service.
Article 9. Outplacement Assistance
Following a Qualifying Termination (as described in Section 3.2 herein), the Executive will be reimbursed by the Company for the costs of all reasonable outplacement services obtained by the Executive within the two (2) year period after the Date of Separation from Service; provided, however, that reimbursements must be made by the end of the third year following the Date of Separation from Service and the total reimbursement for such outplacement services will be limited to an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Executive's Base Salary as of the Date of Separation from Service.
Article 10. Successors and Assignment
10.1. . The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company or of any division or subsidiary thereof to expressly assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform them if no such succession had taken place.
Successors to the Company
10.2. . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive dies while any amount would still be payable to him hereunder had he continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, will be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's Beneficiary. If the Executive has not named a Beneficiary, then such amounts will be paid to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other designee, or if there is no such designee, to the Executive's estate, and such designee, or the Executive's estate will be treated as the Beneficiary hereunder.
Assignment by the Executive

Beneficiaries
 
11.3. .

Further, the captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and will have no force and effect.
Severability
11.4. . No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived, or discharged unless such modification, waiver, or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized member of the Committee, or by the respective parties' legal representatives and successors.
