Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On December 7, 2005, the Committee appointed by the Board of Directors of Fossil, Inc. (the "Company") to administer the Fossil, Inc. and Affiliates Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan") adopted the First Amended and Restated Fossil, Inc. and Affiliates Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Amended Plan").  The Amended Plan amends and restates the Plan, originally adopted on December 22, 1998, in order to comply with recent changes to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and to make certain other clarifying changes.  The Amended Plan is a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan that permits a select group of management or highly compensated employees to defer the receipt of base salary and bonus.
 
The foregoing description of the Amended Plan is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such document, which is incorporated herein by reference and filed as an exhibit hereto.

For purposes of ERISA, the Company intends this Plan to be an unfunded plan solely for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Employers for the purpose of qualifying the Plan for the "top hat" plan exception under sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.

Following removal of the status of Eligible Employee for any Participant, such Participant shall not be able to elect Salary Deferral Contributions on any Entry Date on which he is not an Eligible Employee.

4.2.          .  An Employee who is an Eligible Employee on his Entry Date with respect to a Plan Year may elect to defer from Salary any amount which is not less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) (prorated based on the remaining portion of the Plan Year if the Participant's Entry Date is not January 1st) and not more than fifty percent (50%) of his Salary payable during the portion of the Plan Year following such Entry Date, by filing an Election Form with the Committee prior to such Entry Date.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the election to defer Salary must be designated as a fixed dollar amount.  Each Election Form shall continue to apply to each later Entry Date until a new Election Form is filed; provided, further, that only the last Election Form filed prior to an Entry Date shall be effective.  If an Eligible Employee has never timely filed an Election Form deferring a portion of his Salary, then such Eligible Employee shall not have any portion of his Salary deferred.  Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, the amount of a Participant's Salary Deferral Contributions will be deducted from a Participant's Salary on each payroll date during the Plan Year of reference in an amount equal to the total Salary Deferral Contribution divided by the number of payroll dates during the Plan Year of reference following the Entry Date of reference.
Salary Deferral Contributions
 
4.3.          .  The portion of the Salary Deferral Contribution amount which will be deducted from Salary shall be credited to the Participant's Salary Deferral Account as soon as administratively practicable after the payroll period from which such salary was deferred.
Crediting of Salary Deferral Contributions
 
4.4.          .  At any time on or after the Effective Date, in addition to the amount described in Section 4.2, an Employer may credit a Participant's Employer Account with such amount as it shall determine in its sole discretion.  The name of the Participant, the amount to be credited, the date as of which it is to be credited, the rate of Vesting, and such other matters as are required to be set forth (as determined by the Employer in its sole discretion), shall be set forth on the Addendum; provided that one hundred percent (100%) of such amounts contributed for a Participant, and related Earnings, shall be forfeited on such Participant's Separation from service for reasons other than a Change of Control unless otherwise expressly provided in an Addendum expressly relating to such Employer Contribution.
Employer Contributions
 
4.5.          .  At the discretion of the Plan Administrator, Contributions may be delivered to the Trust or the funds may be retained by the Employer.
Disposition of Contributions
 
SECTION V.
 
PARTICIPANT'S ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS
 
5.1.          .  The Committee shall establish separate Accounts for each Participant, to which shall be credited or debited the Participant's share of Contributions and Earnings, and to which shall be debited the Account's share of expenses and distributions.  Grandfathered Benefits shall be accounted for separately within the Participant's Account.
Establishment of Account
 
5.2.          .  Earnings on amounts credited to an Account shall be credited or debited to such Account on each Business Day based on the value of the Account's Measurement Preferences on such Business Day, all in the manner determined by the Committee in accordance with Rules of General Application.
Earnings Credited to Accounts
 
5.3.          .  Effective as of each Investment Date, in accordance with Rules of General Application, each Participant may select investments ("Measurement Preferences") from among the different investment alternatives which are made available by the Committee, for existing balances in his Account and for future Contributions, such selection of Measurement Preferences to be made in increments of five percent (5%), and such percentages to apply equally to the amount credited to the Participant's Account on the immediately preceding Valuation Date, and to Contributions credited to such Account subsequent to such Valuation Date.  No actual investments shall be made by Participants.  The Measurement Preferences, and the Applicable Interest Rate, are only for the purpose of determining the Employer's payment obligation under the Plan and such Measurement Preferences do not control any actual investments.
Investment Direction
 
5.4.          .  In accordance with Rules of General Application, but not less frequently than one statement for each Plan Year, each Participant shall have a statement made available setting forth: (i) the amount in his Account, (ii) the amount of Contributions, separately showing the Salary Deferral Contributions and Employer Contributions, credited to his Account since the previous statement, (iii) the Earnings credited or debited to his Account since the previous statement, (iv) any debited charges to, or distributions from, his Account since the previous statement, and (v) any other information or disclosures determined appropriate by the Committee.

SECTION VII.
DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFIT
 
7.1.          .  Unless the Participant is entitled to a Deferred Payment or is a Specific Employee, upon a Participant's Separation he shall receive a Lump Sum distribution within sixty (60) days after the Valuation Date next following his Separation.  The amount of such Lump Sum distribution shall be equal to his Benefit determined as of the Valuation Date preceding the date of distribution.
Form and Timing of Distribution
 
7.2.          .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, distributions of Grandfathered Benefits to Specific Employees shall be made in the form and timing set forth in section 7.1 above.  Distributions of all benefits that are not Grandfathered Benefits to Specific Employees for any reason other than death shall not be paid earlier than six (6) months after the Specific Employee ceases to be an Employee.
Special Rules for Specific Employees
 
7.3.          .  A Participant shall be entitled to a Deferred Payment if his Separation is not by reason of his death, and if on his date of Separation: (i) he has attained the age of fifty-five (55) and completed at least five (5) Years of Service, and (ii) has filed an Election Form on which he has (x) selected a Deferred Payment Date, and (y) selected a form of payment.  A Participant's Deferred Payments may be made or commenced at any time, after age fifty-five (55) and prior to the later of age sixty-five (65) or his Separation, and may be paid either in a Lump Sum or in five, ten, or fifteen Installment Payments, as the Participant shall select on the Election Form in effect on his Final Deferral Filing Date, and only the initial Election Form filed on or twelve (12) months before such Final Deferral Filing Date shall be effective.  Any election which delays the distribution beyond the distribution date initially elected or changes the initial form of distribution or elected by the Participant shall not be effective unless it takes effect not less than the later of (i) twelve months prior to the commencement of payment upon Separation by reason of death, disability, or (ii) five years prior to the commencement of payment upon Separation for any other reason.  Installment Payments shall be paid at such time, during the first thirty (30) days of each Plan Year, as shall be determined by the Committee.  If a Participant receiving an Installment Payment shall be reemployed, all such Installment Payments shall cease during the period of his reemployment,
Election of Deferred Payments
 
and shall resume (iii) during the first thirty (30) days of the Plan Year following his Separation, and (iv) shall be paid out in the same number of installments as were remaining to be paid on the date of his reemployment.
 
7.4.          .  If Participant elects a Deferred Payment in the form of Installment Payments, each installment shall be equal to the product of: (i) his Benefit on the Valuation Date next preceding the date of payment, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is one (1), and the denominator of which is the total number of installments originally elected less the number of installments previously paid.
Installment Payments
 
7.5.          .  Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, upon a Change of Control, all Benefits hereunder (including, without limitation, Benefits subject to Deferred Payment elections or which are being paid in Installment Payments), shall be distributed to Participants in a Lump Sum as soon as reasonably possible, but not more than 30 days, after such Change of Control.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the date of a Change of Control, or with respect to each Participant who is not notified in writing of an impending Change of Control at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of Change in Control, for a period of fourteen (14) days after the date of notice of such Change of Control, a Participant may elect to waive the provisions of this Section 7.4 with respect to such Change of Control and his Benefits will continue to be deferred under the Plan as if such Change of Control had not occurred.
Change in Control
 
7.6.          .  Upon the Committee's determination (following petition by the Participant) that the Participant has suffered an "unforeseeable emergency", the Committee shall distribute to Participant that portion of such Participant's Benefit as requested by the Participant and approved by the Committee, but in no event shall the Committee approve a distribution which is greater than is necessary to relieve the financial hardship.  An "unforeseeable emergency" means a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant's spouse, or a dependent of the Participant as defined in Code section 152(a), loss of the Participant's property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant, which the Participant is unable to satisfy through available or attainable assets.  Without limitation, the definition of severe financial hardship does not include the need to send a child to college or the desire to purchase a home.

The Committee shall evaluate the facts and circumstances of each hardship request and may rely on the written representations of the Participant unless it has reason to know such representations are false.  The Participant shall receive a Lump Sum cash payment of the amount approved by the Committee as soon as possible following the next succeeding Valuation Date (or, upon the Participant's request, on such earlier date and under such rules as shall be determined by the Committee), and such amount shall be deducted from his Measurement Preferences in accordance with Rules of General Application.  If a Participant receives a hardship distribution he shall be ineligible to elect Salary Deferral Contributions for the following Plan Year.
 
7.7.            Prior to a Participant's Separation, in accordance with Rules of General Application, a Participant may elect to receive a distribution of all (subject to
Grandfathered Benefits.
 
the forfeiture), or a portion of his Grandfathered Benefit.  If a Participant elects to receive such a distribution, he shall permanently and irrevocably forfeit from his Grandfathered Benefit an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the amount so distributed and such Participant shall be ineligible to elect Salary Deferral Contributions for the following Plan Year.  The amount forfeited shall inure to the benefit of the Employer in the manner determined by the Committee, and such amount shall be deducted from his Measurement Preferences in accordance with Rules of General Application.  Upon separation of service for any reason, Grandfathered Benefits shall be distributable in accordance with the provisions of the Predecessor Plan.
 
7.8.          .  All payments of Benefits shall be in cash from the funds in the Trust or, in the discretion or the Employer, from the Employer's funds held outside of the Trust.  Nothing contained in the Plan, nor any action taken pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, shall create or be construed to create a fiduciary relationship between the Company, an Employer, Participant, Beneficiary, or Employee or other person.  To the extent that any person acquires a right to be paid Benefits, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of his Employer.

SECTION VIII.
 
DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARIES
 
8.1.          .  Participant's written designation of one or more persons or entities as his Beneficiary shall operate to designate the Participant's Beneficiary under this Plan.  The Participant shall file with the Committee a copy of his Beneficiary designation under the Plan.  The last such designation received by the Committee shall be controlling, and no designation, or change or revocation of a designation shall be effective unless received by the Committee prior to the Participant's death, and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt.
Designation by Participant
 
8.2.          .  If no Beneficiary designation is in effect at the time of Participant's death, if no designated Beneficiary survives the Participant or if the otherwise applicable Beneficiary designation conflicts with applicable law, the Participant's estate shall be the Beneficiary.  The Committee may direct the Employer or Trustee to retain any unpaid Benefits, without crediting for either Measurement Preferences or Applicable Interest Rate, until all rights to the unpaid Benefits are determined.  Alternatively, the Committee may direct the Employer or Trustee to pay the Benefits into any court of appropriate jurisdiction.  Any such payment shall completely discharge each Employer, the Trustee, and the Committee from any liability under the Plan.
Lack of Designation
 
SECTION IX.
 
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
 
The Plan, without cause and without prior notice, may be terminated, in whole or in part, by the Board, in which case the Employer Account of any affected Participant shall become one hundred percent (100%) Vested on such date of termination and, notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, the Benefits of such affected Participant will be distributed in a Lump
 
Sum as soon as reasonably possible following such termination. The Plan may be amended at any time by the Board or the Committee and, without limiting the generality of any other provision hereof, if the Committee determines that an amendment to the Plan would result in a substantial prospective reduction in either the rights or benefits of one or more Participants with respect to their Benefit determined as of the effective date of such amendment, the Committee must give each affected Participant notice of the amendment not less than ninety days prior to the taxable year for which the amendment is effective.  Each affected Participant shall be entitled to elect an immediate distribution of all Benefits then credited to such Participant's Account, except that Grandfathered Benefits may be excluded by the Participant from such distribution election.  Pertaining to the amendments made effective January 1, 2005, at any time during the 2005 Plan Year, each Participant shall be entitled to elect to terminate or cancel any deferral election by timely notifying the Committee in accordance with the Rules of General Application.
