As previously reported, Fossil, Inc. (the "Company") received a Nasdaq Staff Determination notice on November 20, 2006, stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) because the Company had not timely filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 7, 2006.  On February 1, 2007, the Company attended a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel"), at which meeting the Company presented its plan to evidence compliance with Nasdaq's filing requirement.
On March 16, 2007, the Company received a letter indicating that the Panel issued a formal decision granting the Company's request for continued listing, subject to the following conditions:  (i) on or about April 16, 2007, the Company must provide certain additional information to the Panel regarding the Company's investigation of its historical equity granting practices and (ii) on or before May 21, 2007, the Company must become current in its delinquent periodic reports, and file required restatements, if any.
On March 13, 2007, the Company received an Additional Staff Determination letter indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) because the Company has not timely filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended January 6, 2007, and that this filing delinquency serves as an additional basis for delisting the Company's securities from the Nasdaq Global Select Market.  The Company intends to request that the Form 10-K delinquency be resolved in the same manner as the Form 10-Q.
There can be no assurance that the Company's securities will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market unless and until the Company can achieve full compliance with all the requirements of the that Market.
The Company issued a press release in connection with the foregoing matters on March 19, 2007, which release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
