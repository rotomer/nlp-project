Item 5.02.
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On August 29, 2007, James M. Zimmerman was appointed to the Board of Directors (the Board) of Fossil, Inc. (the Company) effective September 5, 2007.
Mr. Zimmerman is not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any person pursuant to which he was appointed as director, nor is he a party to any transaction described in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
For his service on the Board, Mr. Zimmerman will receive the Companys normal compensation for a non-employee director.  Such compensation consists of an annual retainer of $30,000, a fee of $1,500 for each in-person meeting, and a fee of $1,000 for each telephonic meeting in excess of one hour.  In addition, pursuant to the Companys Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan, Mr. Zimmerman will receive a grant of non-qualified stock options to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock on the date of becoming a director and an additional grant of non-qualified stock options to purchase 4,000 shares of common stock on the first day of each calendar year if he is then serving as a non-employee director.
 
In addition, on August 29, 2007, the Board terminated the Companys 2002 Restricted Stock Plan (the 2002 Plan) effective August 29, 2007.  Shares awarded under the 2002 Plan were funded with shares contributed to the Company from a significant stockholder.  The rights of any participants in the 2002 Plan with respect to any awards previously granted and currently outstanding as of August 29, 2007 are not impaired by the 2002 Plan's termination and such awards will continue in effect in accordance with their original terms.
