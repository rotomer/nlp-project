(a)
  
.  If Payee reasonably determines that, by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank market generally, deposits in Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to Payee in the interbank market for any LIBOR Interest Period, or that the rate at which such Dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Payee of making or maintaining a LIBOR Balance for such LIBOR Interest Period, Payee shall forthwith give notice thereof to Maker, whereupon until Payee notifies Maker that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (i) the right of Maker to select an Interest Option based upon the LIBOR Base Rate shall be suspended, and (ii) Maker shall convert each LIBOR Balance into the WFB Base Rate Balance in accordance with the provisions hereof on the last day of the then-current LIBOR Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Balance.

Payee will promptly notify Maker of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle Payee to compensation pursuant to this paragraph.  A certificate of Payee claiming compensation under this paragraph and setting forth in reasonable detail the additional amount or amounts to be paid to Payee hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

Maker and each surety, endorser, guarantor and other party ever liable for payment of any sums of money payable on this Note, jointly and severally waive presentment and demand for payment, protest, notice of protest, intention to accelerate, acceleration and non-payment, or other notice of default, and agree that their liability under this Note shall not be affected by any renewal or extension in the time of payment hereof, or in any indulgences, or by any release or change in any security for the payment of this Note, and hereby consent to any and all renewals, extensions, indulgences, releases or changes, regardless of the number of such renewals, extensions, indulgences, releases or changes.

.  Any provision herein, or in any document securing this Note, or any other document executed or delivered in connection herewith, or in any other agreement or commitment, whether written or oral, expressed or implied, to the contrary notwithstanding, neither Payee nor any holder hereof shall in any event be entitled to receive or collect, nor shall or may amounts received hereunder be credited, so that Payee or any holder hereof shall be paid, as interest, a sum greater than the maximum amount permitted by applicable law to be charged to the person, partnership, firm or corporation primarily obligated to pay this Note at the time in question.  If any construction of this Note or any document securing this Note, or any and all other papers, agreements or commitments, indicate a different right given to Payee or any holder hereof to ask for, demand or receive any larger sum as interest, such is a mistake in calculation or wording which this clause shall override and control, it being the intention of the parties that this Note, and all other instruments securing the payment of this Note or executed or delivered in connection herewith shall in all things comply with applicable law and proper adjustments shall automatically be made accordingly.  In the event that Payee or any holder hereof ever receives, collects or applies as interest, any sum in excess of the Maximum Rate, if any, such excess amount shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance of this Note, and if this Note is paid in full, any remaining excess shall be paid to Maker.  In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any specific contingency, exceeds the Maximum Rate, if any, Maker and Payee or any holder hereof shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law: (a) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense or fee rather than as interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, (c) spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire term of this Note; provided that if this Note is paid and performed in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term hereof, and if the interest received for the actual period of existence thereof exceeds the Maximum Rate, if any, Payee or any holder hereof shall refund to Maker the amount of such excess, or credit the amount of such excess against the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all advances made by the Payee or any holder hereof under this Note at the time in question.
