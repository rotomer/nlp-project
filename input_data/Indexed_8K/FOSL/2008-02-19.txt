Operating Results
 
Worldwide net sales for the Fourth Quarter rose 18.5% (13.0% excluding currency impact) to $463.1 million in comparison to the prior year quarter net sales of $390.8 million.  All of the Company's operating segments contributed to the Fourth Quarter net sales growth.  International wholesale sales increased 29.3% (18.4% excluding currency impact) and included a 29.5% (16.0% excluding currency impact) increase from the Company's European segment and a 28.7% (23.9% excluding currency impact) increase from the Company's other international segment.  Net Sales growth in Europe was primarily driven by sales volume growth in licensed brand watches and FOSSIL watches and jewelry while other international net sales growth was principally the result of sales volume increases in licensed and FOSSIL brand watches.  As a result of the Company's growing international presence, an important milestone was achieved during the Fourth Quarter whereby net sales from the Company's international wholesale segments represented 50.2% of total net sales.  Domestically, net sales from the Company's wholesale segment increased 9.1% as a result of an 11.9% increase in domestic watch sales and a 4.7% increase in its other accessory businesses.  Increases in the domestic watch business were primarily driven by sales volume increases in licensed brand, mass market, RELIC and MICHELE watches.  The Company's domestic other accessory sales increase of 4.7% was primarily the result of sales volume growth in FOSSIL handbags, including the newly launched Fifty-Four line, men's gifts and FOSSIL eyewear, partially offset by sales volume declines in women's belts and RELIC handbags.  The impact of the new product launches, including FOSSIL accessories jewelry and cold weather accessories contributed approximately $1.7 million of net sales during the Fourth Quarter.  Direct to consumer sales increased 9.8% compared to the prior year quarter, as a result of a 20.6% increase in the average number of company-owned stores open during the Fourth Quarter and a comparable store sales decline of 3.4% from the prior year.  For fiscal year 2007, consolidated net sales increased 18.0% (13.9% excluding currency impact) principally due to sales volume growth in the Company's international wholesale segments as well as sales growth in the direct to consumer segment as a result of new store openings and comparable store sales increases of 2.8%.
 
For the Fourth Quarter, the Company's gross profit margin was favorably affected by a weaker U.S. dollar, the Company's ongoing initiative to reduce product cost and decrease the proportion of lower margin watch offerings in the line and the increased sales mix of higher margin international sales.  Partially, offsetting these increases in gross profit margin during the Fourth
 
Quarter were increased levels of inventory shrink and a reduction in sales mix from the Company's higher margin direct to consumer segment.  For the Fourth Quarter and fiscal year, the favorable impact on gross profit margin relating to the weaker U.S. dollar contributed approximately 190 basis points and 140 basis points, respectively of improvement in gross profit margin in comparison to the prior year periods.
 
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points during the Fourth Quarter to 35.9% compared to 36.7% in the prior year quarter.  Total operating expenses increased by $22.5 million to $166.1 million in comparison to the prior year quarter and included $6.7 million related to the translation of foreign-based expenses as a result of the weakening U.S. dollar.  Excluding the impact of currency, operating expense increases were primarily the result of increased payroll expense, increased expenses in the Company's direct to consumer segment as a result of new stores opened since the end of fiscal 2006 and higher levels of sales.  For fiscal year 2007, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 38.8% compared to 40.0% in the prior year.  Fiscal year 2007 operating expenses were generally impacted by the same factors as experienced during the Fourth Quarter and additionally included approximately $13.1 million of Grant Review expenses.  Fiscal year 2007 operating expenses also increased approximately $16.1 million due to the translation impact of foreign-based expenses.
 
Operating profit increased 44.0% during the Fourth Quarter to 17.8% of net sales compared to 14.6% of net sales in the prior year quarter as a result of increased gross profit margin and operating expense leverage.  Operating income was favorably impacted by approximately $13.4 million as a result of the translation of foreign-based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars.  During fiscal year 2007, operating profit margin increased to 13.0% compared to 10.2% in the prior year.  The Company's operating income for fiscal year 2007 included approximately $29.0 million of net currency gains related to the translation of foreign-based sales and expenses into U.S. dollars.
 
Interest expense decreased during the Fourth Quarter and fiscal year 2007 in comparison to the comparable prior year periods.  These decreases are principally due to the payment of previously outstanding borrowings on the Company's U.S.-based revolving line of credit at the end of fiscal year 2006, which were primarily used for common stock repurchases in late 2005 and early 2006.
 
Other income (expense) increased unfavorably by approximately $900,000 during the Fourth Quarter primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses partially offset by increased interest income.  For fiscal year 2007, other income (expense) increased favorably by approximately $2.9 million as a result of increased interest income, partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses.  Increased interest income is a result of higher levels of invested cash balances.  Foreign currency transaction losses are primarily related to the settlement of inventory purchases through established forward contracts at rates below the prevailing spot rate at the time of settlement.
 
The Company's effective income tax rate for the Fourth Quarter was 34.3% compared to 37.1% in the prior year quarter.  The lower rate is principally related to an increase in foreign earnings from countries with statutory tax rates below the prevailing tax rate in the U.S.  For fiscal year 2007, the Company's effective tax rate of 34.3% was slightly below the 34.7% effective tax rate in the prior year.
 
Financial Position
 
At the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale totaled $267.9 million compared to $140.2 million at the end of the prior year and the Company had $3.5 million of long term debt.  Inventory at quarter-end was $248.4 million, representing an increase of only 8.9% from the prior year inventory balance of $228.2 million despite an additional 46 net retail stores being opened since the end of the prior year.  Accounts
 
receivable increased by 46.5% to $227.5 million, as compared to $155.2 million at the end of fiscal year 2006.  Days sales outstanding for the Fourth Quarter was 45 days which increased from 36 days in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher levels of international wholesale sales that generally result in longer collection cycles than those experienced in the U.S., a shift in wholesale sales occurring later in the quarter during 2007 compared to 2006 and a reduction in sales mix from the Company's direct to consumer segment.  The shift in wholesale sales was primarily related to production delays on certain watch styles that resulted in later deliveries for the holiday season.
 
Outlook
 
The Company currently estimates that first quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share will approximate $0.39 on a net sales increase in the range of 12% to 14%.  For fiscal year 2008, the Company currently estimates fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.12 to $2.18 with net sales growth in the low to mid-teens range.  This guidance reflects the current prevailing rate of the U.S. dollar compared to other foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and Pound.
 
To date, the Company has purchased approximately 1.1 million common shares pursuant to the two million share buyback plan it announced in November of 2007.  The Company is acquiring such shares through a plan qualified under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and expects such repurchases to be completed by mid-April, 2008. The primary purpose of this repurchase program is to minimize the dilutive effect on earnings per share related to common shares granted and stock options exercised under the Company's equity-based compensation program.
