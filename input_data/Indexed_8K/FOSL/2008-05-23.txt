(a)           The grant of an Award shall be authorized by the Committee and shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement setting forth the Incentive or Incentives being granted, the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Incentive(s), the Option Price (if applicable), the Award Period, the Date of Grant, and such other terms, provisions, limitations, and performance objectives, as are approved by the Committee, but (i) not inconsistent with the Plan, (ii) to the extent an Award issued under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations or other guidance issued thereunder, and (iii) to the extent the Committee determines that an Award shall comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations and other guidance issued thereunder.  The Company shall execute an Award Agreement with a Participant after the Committee approves the issuance of an Award.  Any Award granted pursuant to this Plan must be granted within ten (10) years of the date of adoption of this Plan. The Plan shall be submitted to the Companys stockholdersfor approval; however, the Committee may grant Awards under the Plan prior to the time of stockholder approval.  Any such Award granted prior to such stockholderapproval shall be made subject to such stockholderapproval. The grant of an Award to a Participant shall not be deemed either to entitle the Participant to, or to disqualify the Participant from, receipt of any other Award under the Plan.
 
 
 
(b)           If the Committee establishes a purchase price for an Award, the Participant must accept such Award within a period of thirty (30) days (or such shorter period as the Committee may specify) after the Date of Grant by executing the applicable Award Agreement and paying such purchase price.
(c)           Any Award under this Plan that is settled in whole or in part in cash on a deferred basis may provide for interest equivalents to be credited with respect to such cash payment. Interest equivalents may be compounded and shall be paid upon such terms and conditions as may be specified by the grant.
             The Option Price for any share of Common Stock which may be purchased under a Nonqualified Stock Option for any share of Common Stock may be equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of the share on the Date of Grant.  The Option Price for any share of Common Stock which may be purchased under an Incentive Stock Option must be at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the share on the Date of Grant; if an Incentive Stock Option is granted to an Employee who owns or is deemed to own (by reason of the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code) more than ten percent (10%) of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company (or any parent or Subsidiary), the Option Price shall be at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Date of Grant.
6.2
Option Price.
             The Committee may not grant Incentive Stock Options under the Plan to any Employee which would permit the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined on the Date of Grant) of the Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options (under this and any other plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries) are exercisable for the first time by such Employee during any calendar year to exceed $100,000.  To the extent any Stock Option granted under this Plan which is designated as an Incentive Stock Option exceeds this limit or otherwise fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, such Stock Option (or any such portion thereof) shall be a Nonqualified Stock Option.  In such case, the Committee shall designate which stock will be treated as Incentive Stock Option stock by causing the issuance of a separate stock certificate and identifying such stock as Incentive Stock Option stock on the Companys stock transfer records.
6.3
Maximum ISO Grants.
             If Restricted Stock is granted to or received by a Participant under an Award (including a Stock Option), the Committee shall set forth in the related Award Agreement: (i) the number of shares of Common Stock awarded, (ii) the price, if any, to be paid by the Participant for such Restricted Stock and the method of payment of the price, (iii) the time or times within which such Award may be subject to forfeiture, (iv) specified Performance Goals of the Company, a Subsidiary, any division thereof or any group of Employees of the Company, or other criteria, which the Committee determines must be met in order to remove any restrictions (including vesting) on such Award, and (v) all other terms, limitations, restrictions, and conditions of the Restricted Stock, which shall be consistent with this Plan, to the extent applicable and in the event the Committee determines that an Award shall comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, in compliance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder and, to the extent Restricted Stock granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations or other guidance issued thereunder.  The provisions of Restricted Stock need not be the same with respect to each Participant.
6.4
Restricted Stock.
             The Company shall electronically register the Restricted Stock awarded to a Participant in the name of such Participant, which shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock, substantially as provided in of the Plan.   No stock certificate or certificates shall be issued with respect to such shares of Common Stock, unless, following the expiration of the Restriction Period (as defined in ) without forfeiture in respect of such shares of Common Stock, the Participant requests delivery of the certificate or certificates by submitting a written request to the Committee (or such party designated by the Company) requesting deliver of the certificates.  The Company shall deliver the certificates requested by the Participant to the Participant as soon as administratively practicable following the Companys receipt of such request.

(i)           Subject to the other provisions of this Plan and the terms of the particular Award Agreements, during such period as may be determined by the Committee commencing on the Date of Grant or the date of exercise of an Award (the ), the Participant shall not be permitted to sell, transfer, pledge or assign shares of Restricted Stock. Except for these limitations and subject to the provisions of below, the Committee may in its sole discretion, remove any or all of the restrictions on such Restricted Stock whenever it may determine that, by reason of changes in applicable laws or other changes in circumstances arising after the date of the Award, such action is appropriate.
Restriction Period
Section 8.2
(ii)           Except as provided in sub-paragraph (i) above or in the applicable Award Agreement, the Participant shall have, with respect to his or her Restricted Stock, all of the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote the shares, and the right to receive any dividends thereon.  The Company shall electronically register the Restricted Stock in the name of the Participant, but shall not issue certificates for the Restricted Stock unless the Participant requests delivery of the certificates for the Restricted Stock, in writing in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee.  A Participant may only request delivery of certificates for shares of Common Stock free of restriction under this Plan after the Restriction Period expires without forfeiture in respect of such shares of Common Stock or after any other restrictions imposed on such shares of Common Stock by the applicable Award Agreement or other agreement have expired.  Each Award Agreement shall require that (x) each Participant, by his or her acceptance of Restricted Stock, shall irrevocably grant to the Company a power of attorney to transfer any shares so forfeited to the Company and agrees to execute any documents requested by the Company in connection with such forfeiture and transfer, and (y) such provisions regarding returns and transfers of stock certificates with respect to forfeited shares of Common Stock shall be specifically performable by the Company in a court of equity or law.
(iii)           The Restriction Period of Restricted Stock shall commence on the Date of Grant or the date of exercise of an Award, as specified in the Award Agreement, and, subject to of the Plan, unless otherwise established by the Committee in the Award Agreement setting forth the terms of the Restricted Stock, shall expire upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Award Agreement; such conditions may provide for vesting based on such Performance Goals, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
Article 13
(iv)           Except as otherwise provided in the particular Award Agreement, upon Termination of Service for any reason during the Restriction Period, the nonvested shares of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited by the Participant.  In the event a Participant has paid any consideration to the Company for such forfeited Restricted Stock, the Committee shall specify in the Award Agreement that either (i) the Company shall be obligated to, or (ii) the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to, pay to the Participant, as soon as practicable after the event causing forfeiture, in cash, an amount equal to the lesser of the total consideration paid by the Participant for such forfeited shares or the Fair Market Value of such forfeited shares as of the date of Termination of Service, as the Committee, in its sole discretion shall select. Upon any forfeiture, all rights of a Participant with respect to the forfeited shares of the Restricted Stock shall cease and terminate, without any further obligation on the part of the Company.
             The Committee may grant SARs to any Participant, either as a separate Award or in connection with a Stock Option.  SARs shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall impose, provided that such terms and conditions are (i)  not inconsistent with the Plan,  (ii) to the extent a SAR issued under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations or other guidance issued thereunder, and (iii)  to the extent the Committee determines that a SAR shall comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations and other guidance issued thereunder, in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations or other guidance issued thereunder.  The grant of the SAR may provide that the holder may be paid for the value of the SAR either in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof.  In the event of the exercise of a SAR payable in shares of Common Stock, the holder of the SAR shall receive that number of whole shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the value obtained by multiplying (i) the difference between the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the  SAR Price as set forth in such SAR (or other value specified in the agreement granting the SAR), by (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock as to which the SAR is exercised, with a cash settlement to be made for any fractional shares of Common Stock.  The SAR Price for any share of Common Stock subject to a SAR may be  equal to  or greater than the Fair Market Value of the share on the Date of Grant.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may place a ceiling on the amount payable upon exercise of a SAR, but any such limitation shall be specified at the time that the SAR is granted.
6.5
SARs.
             Restricted Stock Units may be awarded or sold to any Participant under such terms and conditions as shall be established by the Committee, provided, however, that such terms and conditions are (i) not inconsistent with the Plan, (ii) to the extent a Restricted Stock Unit issued under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations or other guidance issued thereunder, and (iii) to the extent the Committee determines that a Restricted Stock Unit shall comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations and other guidance issued thereunder, in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations or other guidance issued thereunder.  The grant of the Restricted Stock Units may provide that the holder may be paid for the value of the Restricted Stock Unit either in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof.  Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee determines, including, without limitation, (a) a prohibition against sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other encumbrance for a specified period; or (b) a requirement that the holder forfeit (or in the case of shares of Common Stock or units sold to the Participant, resell to the Company at cost) such shares or units in the event of Termination of Service during the period of restriction.
6.6
Restricted Stock Units.
6.7           Performance Awards.
(a)           The Committee may grant Performance Awards to one or more Participants.  The terms and conditions of Performance Awards shall be specified at the time of the grant and may include provisions establishing the performance period, the Performance Goals to be achieved during a performance period, and the maximum or minimum settlement values, provided that such terms and conditions are (i) not inconsistent with the Plan and (ii) to the extent a Performance Award issued under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations or other guidance issued thereunder.  If the Performance Award is to be in shares of Common Stock, the Performance Awards may provide for the issuance of the shares of Common Stock at the time of the grant of the Performance Award or at the time of  the certification by the Committee that the Performance Goals for the performance period have been met; provided, however, if shares of Common Stock are issued at the time of the grant of the Performance Award and if, at the end of the performance period, the Performance Goals are not certified by the Committee to have been fully satisfied, then, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan to the contrary, the Common Stock shall be forfeited in accordance with the terms of the grant to the extent the Committee determines that the Performance Goals were not met. The forfeiture of shares of Common Stock issued at the time of the grant of the Performance Award due to failure to achieve the established Performance Goals shall be separate from and in addition to any other restrictions provided for in this Plan that may be applicable to such shares of Common Stock.   Each Performance Award granted to one or more Participants shall have its own terms and conditions.
To the extent the Committee determines that a Performance Award shall comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations and other guidance issued thereunder, and if it is determined to be necessary in order to satisfy Section 162(m) of the Code, at the time of the grant of a Performance Award (other than a Stock Option) and to the extent permitted under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder, the Committeeshall provide for the manner in which the Performance Goals shall be reduced to take into account the negative effect on the achievement of specified levels of the Performance Goals which may result from enumerated corporate transactions, extraordinary events, accounting changes and other similar occurrences which were unanticipated at the time the Performance Goal was initially established.   In no event, however, may the Committee increase the amount earned under such a Performance Award, unless the reduction in the Performance Goals would reduce or eliminate the amount to be earned under the Performance Award and the Committee determines not to make such reduction or elimination.
With respect to a Performance Award that is not intended to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 162(m), if the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the established performance measures or objectives are no longer suitable because of a change in the Companys business, operations, corporate structure, or for other reasons that the Committee deemed satisfactory, the Committee may modify the performance measures or objectives and/or the performance period.
 (b)           Performance Awards may be valued by reference to the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock or according to any formula or method deemed appropriate by the Committee, in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, achievement of Performance Goals or other specific financial, production, sales or cost performance objectives that the Committee believes to be relevant to the Companys business and/or remaining in the employ of the Company for a specified period of time.  Performance Awards may be paid in cash, shares of Common Stock, or other consideration, or any combination thereof.  If payable in shares of Common Stock, the consideration for the issuance of such shares may be the achievement of the performance objective established at the time of the grant of the Performance Award.  Performance Awards may be payable in a single payment or in installments and may be payable at a specified date or dates or upon attaining the performance objective.  The extent to which any applicable performance objective has been achieved shall be conclusively determined by the Committee.
(c)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, if applicable, no Participant may receive in any calendar year Performance Awards intended to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code which have an aggregate value of more than$1,000,000, and if such Performance Awards involve the issuance of shares of Common Stock, said aggregate value shall be based on the Fair Market Value of such shares on the time of the grant of the Performance Award.  In no event, however, shall any Performance Awards not intended to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code be issued contingent upon the failure to attain the Performance Goals applicable to any Performance Awards granted hereunder that the Committee intends to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
           The Committee may grant a Dividend Equivalent Right to any Participant, either as a component of another Award or as a separate Award. The terms and conditions of the Dividend Equivalent Right shall be specified by the grant.  Dividend equivalents credited to the holder of a Dividend Equivalent Right may be paid currently or may be deemed to be reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock (which may thereafter accrue additional dividend equivalents).  Any such reinvestment shall be at the Fair Market Value at the time thereof.  Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, in a single payment or in installments.  A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled upon exercise, settlement, or payment of, or lapse of restrictions on, such other Award, and that such Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may also contain terms and conditions different from such other Award.
6.8
Dividend Equivalent Rights.  
             The Committee may grant to any Participant other forms of Awards,  based upon, payable in, or otherwise related to, in whole or in part, shares of Common Stock, if the Committee determines that such other form of Award is consistent with the purpose and restrictions of this Plan.  The terms and conditions of such other form of Award shall be specified by the grant.  Such Other Awards may be granted for no cash consideration, for such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law, or for such other consideration as may be specified by the grant.
6.9
Other Awards.
           Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Award and Other Awards (whether relating to cash or shares of Common Stock) under the Plan may be made subject to the attainment of Performance Goals relating to one or more business criteria which, where applicable, shall be within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and consist of one or more or any combination of the following criteria: cash flow; cost; revenues;  sales; ratio of debt to debt plus equity; net borrowing, credit quality or debt ratings; profit before tax; economic profit; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; gross margin; earnings per share (whether on a pre-tax, after-tax, operational or other basis); operating earnings; capital expenditures; expenses or expense levels; economic value added; ratio of operating earnings to capital spending or any other operating ratios; free cash flow; net profit; net sales; net asset value per share; the accomplishment of mergers, acquisitions, dispositions, public offerings or similar extraordinary business transactions; sales growth; price of the Companys Common Stock; return on assets, equity or stockholdersequity; market share; inventory levels, inventory turn or shrinkage; or total return to stockholders().  Any Performance Criteria may be used to measure the performance of the Company as a whole or any business unit of the Company and may be measured relative to a peer group or index.  Any Performance Criteria may include or exclude (i) extraordinary, unusual and/or non-recurring items of gain or loss, (ii) gains or losses on the disposition of a business, (iii) changes in tax or accounting regulations or laws, (iv) the effect of a merger or acquisition, as identified in the Companys quarterly and annual earnings releases, or (v) other similar occurrences.  In all other respects, Performance Criteria shall be calculated in accordance with the Companys financial statements, under generally accepted accounting principles, or under a methodology established by the Committee prior to the issuance of an Award which is consistently applied and identified in the audited financial statements, including footnotes, or the Management Discussion and Analysis section of the Companys annual report and/or the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the Companys annual report and/or proxy.  However, to the extent Section 162(m) of the Code is applicable, the Committee may not in any event increase the amount of compensation payable to an individual upon the attainment of a Performance Goal.

             The Committee may grant two or more Incentives in one Award in the form of a tandem Award, so that the right of the Participant to exercise one Incentive shall be canceled if, and to the extent, the other Incentive is exercised.  For example, if a Stock Option and a SAR are issued in a tandem Award, and the Participant exercises the SAR with respect to 100 shares of Common Stock, the right of the Participant to exercise the related Stock Option shall be canceled to the extent of 100 shares of Common Stock.

           If a Stock Option is exercisable prior to the time it is vested, the Common Stock obtained on the exercise of the Stock Option shall be Restricted Stock which is subject to the applicable provisions of the Plan and the Award Agreement.  If the Committee imposes conditions upon exercise, then subsequent to the Date of Grant, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the date on which all or any portion of the Stock Option may be exercised.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such adjustment shall be made or authorized to the extent that such adjustment would cause the Plan or any Stock Option to violate Section 422 of the Code or Section 409A of the Code.  Such adjustments shall be made in accordance with the rules of any securities exchange, stock market, or stock quotation system to which the Company is subject.

Cancellation of Incentives.  
Sections 13.2 and 13.3
(a)           giving notice to each holder thereof or his personal representative of its intention to cancel those Incentives for which the issuance of shares of Common Stock involved payment by the Participant for such shares, and permitting the purchase during the thirty (30) day period next preceding such effective date of any or all of the shares of Common Stock subject to such outstanding Incentives, including in the Committees discretion some or all of the shares as to which such Incentives would not otherwise be vested and exercisable; or
(b)           in the case of Incentives that are either (i) settled only in shares of Common Stock, or (ii) at the election of the Participant, settled in shares of Common Stock, paying the holder thereof an amount equal to a reasonable estimate of the difference between the net amount per share payable in such transaction or as a result of such transaction, and the price per share of such Incentive to be paid by the Participant (hereinafter the ), multiplied by the number of shares subject to the Incentive.  In cases where the shares constitute, or would after exercise, constitute Restricted Stock, the Company, in its discretion, may include some or all of those shares in the calculation of the amount payable hereunder.  In estimating the Spread, appropriate adjustments to give effect to the existence of the Incentives shall be made, such as deeming the Incentives to have been exercised, with the Company receiving the exercise price payable thereunder, and treating the shares receivable upon exercise of the Incentives as being outstanding in determining the net amount per share.  In cases where the proposed transaction consists of the acquisition of assets of the Company, the net amount per share shall be calculated on the basis of the net amount receivable with respect to shares of Common Stock upon a distribution and liquidation by the Company after giving effect to expenses and charges, including but not limited to taxes, payable by the Company before such liquidation could be completed.
Spread
(c)           An Award that by its terms would be fully vested or exercisable upon a Change in Control will be considered vested or exercisable for purposes of hereof.
Section 13.4(a)
Subject to hereof, in case the Company shall, at any time while any Incentive under this Plan shall be in force and remain unexpired, (i) sell all or substantially all of its property, or (ii) dissolve, liquidate, or wind up its affairs, then each Participant shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of each share of Common Stock of the Company which such Participant would have been entitled to receive under the Incentive, the same kind and amount of any securities or assets as may be issuable, distributable, or payable upon any such sale, dissolution, liquidation, or winding up with respect to each share of Common Stock of the Company.  If the Company shall, at any time prior to the expiration of any Incentive, make any partial distribution of its assets, in the nature of a partial liquidation, whether payable in cash or in kind (but excluding the distribution of a cash dividend payable out of earned surplus and designated as such) and an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate to prevent the dilution of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, make such adjustment in accordance with the provisions of hereof.
Section 13.4
Article 12
Incentives may be granted under the Plan from time to time in substitution for similar instruments held by employees, independent contractors or directors of a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company who become or are about to become Employees, Contractors or Outside Directors of the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of a merger or consolidation of the employing corporation with the Company, the acquisition by the Company of equity of the employing entity, or any other similar transaction pursuant to which the Company becomes the successor employer.  The terms and conditions of the substitute Incentives so granted may vary from the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan to such extent as the Committee at the time of grant may deem appropriate to conform, in whole or in part, to the provisions of the Incentives in substitution for which they are granted.
             The Company may require that there be presented to and filed with it by any Participant under the Plan, such evidence as it may deem necessary to establish that the Incentives granted or the shares of Common Stock to be purchased or transferred are being acquired for investment and not with a view to their distribution.
16.1
Investment Intent.
             Neither the Plan nor any Incentive granted under the Plan shall confer upon any Participant any right with respect to continuance of employment by the Company or any Subsidiary.
16.2

             No member of the Board or the Committee, nor any officer or Employee of the Company acting on behalf of the Board or the Committee, shall be personally liable for any action, determination, or interpretation taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan, and all members of the Board and the Committee, each officer of the Company, and each Employee of the Company acting on behalf of the Board or the Committee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected by the Company in respect of any such action, determination, or interpretation.
16.3
Indemnification of Board and Committee.
             Neither the adoption of this Plan nor any action of the Board or the Committee shall be deemed to give any person any right to be granted an Award or any other rights except as may be evidenced by an Award Agreement, or any amendment thereto, duly authorized by the Committee and executed on behalf of the Company, and then only to the extent and upon the terms and conditions expressly set forth therein.
16.4
Effect of the Plan.
             Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to sell or issue shares of Common Stock under any Incentive if the issuance thereof would constitute a violation by the Participant or the Company of any provisions of any law or regulation of any governmental authority or any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system or other forum in which shares of Common Stock are quoted or traded (including without limitation Section 16 of the 1934 Act and Section 162(m) of the Code); and, as a condition of any sale or issuance of shares of Common Stock under an Incentive, the Committee may require such agreements or undertakings, if any, as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable to assure compliance with any such law or regulation.  The Plan, the grant and exercise of Incentives hereunder, and the obligation of the Company to sell and deliver shares of Common Stock, shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations and to such approvals by any government or regulatory agency as may be required.
16.5
Compliance With Other Laws and Regulations.
             The Company or, if applicable, any Subsidiary (for purposes of this , the term  shall be deemed to include any applicable Subsidiary), shall have the right to deduct from all amounts paid in cash or other form in connection with the Plan, any Federal, state, local, or other taxes required by law to be withheld in connection with an Award granted under this Plan.

Such payment may be made (i) by the delivery of cash to the Company in an amount that equals or exceeds (to avoid the issuance of fractional shares under (iii) below) the required tax withholding obligations of the Company; (ii) if the Company, in its sole discretion, so consents in writing, the actual delivery by the exercising Participant to the Company of shares of Common Stock, which shares so delivered have an aggregate Fair Market Value that equals or exceeds (to avoid the issuance of fractional shares under (iii) below) the required tax withholding payment; (iii) if the Company, in its sole discretion, so consents in writing, the Companys withholding of a number of shares to be delivered upon the exercise of the Stock Option, which shares so withheld have an aggregate Fair Market Value that equals or exceeds the required tax withholding payment; or (iv) any combination of (i), (ii), or (iii).  To the extent the number of shares delivered in accordance with or withheld in accordance with exceeds the required tax withholding due, the Company shall make a cash payment to the Participant equal to the excess amount as soon as administratively practicable thereafter.  The Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold any such taxes from any other cash remuneration otherwise paid by the Company to the Participant.  The Committee may in the Award Agreement impose any additional taxrequirements or provisions that the Committee deems necessary or desirable.
