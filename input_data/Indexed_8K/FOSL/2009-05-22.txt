At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Fossil, Inc. (the "Company") on May 20, 2009, the terms of Kenneth W. Anderson and Alan J. Gold as members of the board of directors (the "Board") of the Company expired, and Messrs. Anderson and Gold were not nominated for re-election to the Board.

Messrs. Anderson and Gold will be entitled to receive customary reimbursement for travel and related expenses, but will not otherwise be entitled to receive any compensation for their service as Advisory Directors.  The Company stock options that Messrs. Anderson and Gold held on May 20, 2009 will continue to vest and be exercisable as if they were still serving as members of the Board.  Pursuant to letter agreements executed with each of Messrs. Anderson and Gold, they will not receive any future automatic stock option grants.  The letter agreements are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

In addition, I understand that all of the outstanding stock options granted to me, as of the date hereof, will continue to remain in effect as the option agreements are written.
 
Lastly, this letter serves as my election to decline participation in the 2008 Plan.  I understand and agree that by declining to participate in the 2008 Plan I shall not be entitled to any further annual automatic director grants made pursuant to the 2008 Plan that would otherwise be available to me as an outside director of the Company.
