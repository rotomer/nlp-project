Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On April 14, 2010, each of Michael W. Barnes, Jeffrey N. Boyer, Kosta N. Kartsotis, Elysia Holt Ragusa, James E. Skinner, Michael Steinberg and James M. Zimmerman, who are the members of the board of directors (the Board) of Fossil, Inc. (the Company) whose terms do not expire at the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders (the Annual Meeting), tendered his or her resignation, contingent and effective upon stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting of a proposal to amend the Companys Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to eliminate the classification of the Board and to provide instead for the annual election of directors (the Proposal). If the proposal is approved, the Companys certificate of incorporation, as amen ded and restated, will provide for the annual election of directors beginning at the Annual Meeting and each of our current directors, with the exception of Mr. Tom Kartsotis who is not seeking re-election to the Board, will be a nominee for election as a director at the Annual Meeting.
The resignations described above are for the sole purpose of establishing a non-classified Board of Directors of the Company and are not due to a disagreement with the Company regarding any matter relating to the Companys operations, policies or practices.  The resignations will be of no effect if the Proposal is not approved at the Annual Meeting.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
