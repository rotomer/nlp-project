Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 17, 2010, Fossil, Inc. (the "Company"), as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender, certain lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole book manager. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans in the amount of $300.0 million, a swingline loan of $20.0 million, and the provision of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement expires and is due and payable on December 17, 2013. It is guaranteed by all direct and indirect material domestic subsidiaries of the Company, as provided in a subsidiary guaranty agreement, and secured by 65% of the total outstanding voting capital stock and 100% of the non-voting Capital Stock of Fossil Europe B.V. and Swiss Technology Holding GmbH, foreign subsidiaries of the Company, pursuant to a pledge agreement. The Credit Agreement may be used to refinance certain existing indebtedness, finance the acquisition of capital assets and for ongoing working capital and other general corporate purposes.
The Credit Agreement replaced that certain Loan Agreement dated as of September 23, 2004, as amended, by and between Fossil Partners, L.P., a subsidiary of the Company, as borrower, the Company, and certain subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, and Wells Fargo, which was scheduled to mature on December 31, 2010 (the "Old Agreement"). No amounts were outstanding under the Old Agreement except for three letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $597,818.67. Upon termination of the Old Agreement, these letters of credit will continue to be issued and outstanding under the Credit Agreement. No penalties or other early termination fees were incurred in connection with the termination of the Old Agreement. For more information about the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, see Item 1.02 below.
Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the Company's option of (i) the base rate (defined as the higher of (a) the prime rate publicly announced by Wells Fargo, (b) the federal funds rate plus 1.50% and (c) LIBOR plus 1.50%) plus the base rate applicable margin (which varies based upon the Company's consolidated leverage ratio (the "Ratio") from 0.25% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00 to 1.00% if the Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00) or (ii) the LIBOR rate (defined as the quotient obtained by dividing (a) LIBOR by (b) 1.00 minus the Eurodollar reserve percentage) plus the LIBOR rate applicable margin (which varies based upon the Ratio from 1.25% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00 to 2.00% if the Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00). Amounts outstanding under the swingline loan under the Credit Agreement or upon any drawing under a letter of credit bear interest at the base rate plus the base rate applicable margin. Interest based upon the base rate is payable quarterly in arrears. Interest based upon the LIBOR rate is payable either monthly or quarterly in arrears, depending on the interest period selected by the Company.
Financial covenants governing the Credit Agreement require the Company to maintain (i) a consolidated leverage ratio no greater than 2.50 to 1.00, (ii) consolidated tangible net worth no less than the sum of (a) $600.0 million plus (b) 25% of positive consolidated net income, (iii) consolidated net income that is not negative for any two consecutive fiscal quarters, and (iv) maximum capital expenditures not in excess of $125.0 million in any fiscal year, subject to certain adjustments. The Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants, events of default and indemnities that are customary for agreements of this type.
The Company paid an upfront fee of $450,000.00, an arrangement fee of $525,000.00, an agency fee of $15,000.00 and a syndication expense of $600.00 in connection with the Credit Agreement. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused amounts of the commitments under the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement, payable quarterly in arrears. The commitment fee is determined based upon the Ratio and varies from 0.20% if the Ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00 to 0.35% if the Ratio is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00. Swingline loans are not deemed to be a utilization of the revolving credit facility for purposes of the commitment fee calculations. In connection with any letter of credit, the Company is required to pay (i) a commitment fee, payable quarterly in arrears, in an amount equal to the face amount of the letter of credit multiplied by the base rate applicable margin, (ii) a fronting fee, payable quarterly in arrears, as set forth in the applicable letter of credit application or as otherwise separately agreed by the Company and the issuing lender, and (iii) normal and customary costs and expenses incurred or charged by the issuing lender in issuing, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering the letter of credit.
Loans under the Credit Agreement may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, in minimum principal amounts of $2.0 million or increments of $1.0 million in excess thereof with respect to a base rate loan, $5.0 million or increments of $1.0 million in excess thereof with respect to a LIBOR rate loan and $100,000 or increments of $100,000 in excess thereof with respect to a swingline loan. Loans under the Credit Agreement must be repaid, or letter of credit obligations cash collateralized with the net proceeds of certain asset sales, insurance and condemnation events. The Company may permanently reduce the revolving credit commitment at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, in a minimum aggregate principal amount of not less than $3.0 million or increments of $1.0 million in excess thereof.
The repayment obligation under the Credit Agreement can be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default, including the failure to pay principal or interest, a material inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, violation of covenants, cross-default, change in control, bankruptcy events, failure of a loan document provision, certain ERISA events and material judgments.
Other than the Credit Agreement, the Old Agreement and matters related to such agreements, there are no material relationships between the Company or any of its affiliates and Wells Fargo or Bank of America, N.A., the other lender under the Credit Agreement.
The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Credit Agreement, the Guaranty Agreement and the Pledge Agreement which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference.

Obligations of Lenders

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the daily average Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

Nature of Obligations of Lenders Regarding Extensions of Credit
 
SECTION 5.8 .
Changed Circumstances
(a) . In connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR or a conversion to or continuation thereof, if for any reason (i) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan or any Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR or (iii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower. Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans or Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR shall be suspended, and (i) in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans, the Borrower shall either (A) repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full) the then outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan together with accrued interest thereon (subject to ), on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan; or (B) convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR as of the last day of such Interest Period; or (ii) in the case of Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR, the Borrower shall convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such Loan to a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR as of the last day of such Interest Period.

Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR, and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to LIBOR shall be suspended and thereafter the Borrower may select only Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR hereunder, (ii) all Base Rate Loans shall cease to be determined by reference to LIBOR and (iii) if any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable Loan shall immediately be converted to a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR for the remainder of such Interest Period.
Laws Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability

The amount of such loss or expense shall be determined based upon the assumption that such Lender funded its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the LIBOR Rate Loans in the London interbank market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical. A certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the factual basis for, and calculations used in, determining such amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error.

1. . This Guaranty Agreement is executed by the Guarantors pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other Secured Parties. As an inducement to the Lenders to make the Loans and extend and continue to extend credit and other financial accommodations to the Borrower under the Loan Documents, to the Issuing Lender to provide Letters of Credit as provided by the Credit Agreement and to the other Secured Parties to make financial accommodations to the Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries, for value received, each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally, and unconditionally, irrevocably and absolutely, guarantees to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other Secured Parties the prompt and full payment and performance of all of the Guaranteed Obligations when due or declared to be due and at all times thereafter.
Guaranty of Guaranteed Obligations
 
Each Guarantor and, by its acceptance of this Guaranty Agreement, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and the Lenders and the other Secured Parties, hereby confirms that it is the intention of such Persons that this Guaranty Agreement and the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for the purposes of any Insolvency Proceeding, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty Agreement and the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each of the Administrative Agent and the Guarantors hereby agrees that the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will not result in such obligations of such Guarantor hereunder or this Guaranty Agreement constituting an unenforceable fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance.
2. . This Guaranty Agreement is and shall be an absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing unlimited guaranty of payment, and not solely of collection. Each Guarantor jointly and severally guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, without setoff or counterclaim, and regardless of any Applicable Law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or other Secured Party with respect thereto. The Guaranteed Obligations may, in accordance with the Loan Documents, be increased, reduced or paid in full at any time and from time to time without affecting the liability or obligation of any Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement with respect to all Guaranteed Obligations, whenever incurred or arising. All Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter arising shall be conclusively presumed to have been made or acquired in acceptance hereof. Each Guarantor shall be liable, jointly and severally, with the Borrower and any other Person now or hereafter obligated in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any portion thereof. It is the intention of the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other Secured Parties that the Guarantors' liabilities and obligations hereunder shall not be discharged except upon Full Payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.

The value of the consideration received and to be received by each Guarantor in connection with the Credit Agreement and other Loan Documents is, in the judgment of such Guarantor, reasonably worth at least as much as the liability and obligation of such Guarantor hereunder.
(b) Each Guarantor is currently informed of the financial condition of the Borrower, each other Credit Party and any and all other Persons obligated in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and of all other circumstances which a diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor has read and understands the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents. Each Guarantor is familiar with, and has had an opportunity to review the books and records regarding, the financial condition of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties and is familiar with the value of any and all property intended to be security for the payment of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; that no Guarantor is relying on such financial condition or the existence or value of any such security as an inducement to enter into this Guaranty Agreement. Each Guarantor has adequate means to obtain, on a continuing basis, information concerning the financial condition of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties. No Guarantor has been induced to enter into this Guaranty Agreement on the basis of a contemplation, belief, understanding or agreement that any Person other than the Guarantors will be liable to pay the Guaranteed Obligations.

(c) The Administrative Agent shall have the right to seek recourse against any Guarantor to the fullest extent provided for herein, and no election by the Administrative Agent to proceed in one form of action or proceeding or against any party, or on any obligation, shall constitute a waiver of the Administrative Agent's right to proceed in any other form of action or proceeding or against other parties unless the Administrative Agent has expressly waived such right in writing. Without limiting the foregoing, no action or proceeding by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or other Secured Party under any agreement, document or instrument evidencing the Guaranteed Obligations shall serve to diminish the liability of any Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement except to the extent that the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other Secured Parties finally and unconditionally shall have realized the Full Payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.

(j) Each Guarantor consents and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender or other Secured Party shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Guarantor or otherwise in connection with obtaining payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations from any Person or source.
(k) Each Guarantor agrees that the Administrative Agent may, at any time and from time to time in its discretion and with or without valuable consideration, allow substitution or withdrawal of Collateral or other security and release Collateral or other security without impairing or diminishing the liabilities or obligations of any Guarantor hereunder.

7. .

If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower or any other Credit Party under or with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed or otherwise delayed as a result of any Insolvency Proceeding involving any Credit Party, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent, and each Guarantor expressly and unconditionally agrees to make such payment in full.

provided
however
(i) To declare the Pledgor immediately in default under this Agreement and, in accordance with Applicable Law, to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof, from time to time upon ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Pledgor of the time and place of sale (which notice the Pledgor hereby agrees is commercially reasonable), for cash or upon credit or for future delivery (the Pledgor hereby waives all rights, if any, of marshaling the Collateral and any other security for the payment of the sums owed by the Pledgor to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and/or the other Secured Parties) and at the option and in the complete discretion of the Administrative Agent, either: (A) at a public sale or sales, including a sale at any broker's board or exchange; or (B) at a private sale or sales. The Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Secured Party may bid for and acquire the Collateral or any portion thereof at any public sale, free from any redemption rights of the Pledgor and, in lieu of paying cash therefor, may make settlement for the selling price of the Collateral or any part thereof by crediting the net selling price of the Collateral against the Obligations in the manner approved by the Administrative Agent, after deducting all of the Administrative Agent's reasonable costs and expenses of every kind and nature therefrom, including the Administrative Agent's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with realizing upon the Collateral and enforcing the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. From time to time the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, postpone the time of any proposed sale of any of the Collateral which has been the subject of a notice as provided above, and also, upon such notice to the Pledgor as may be required by Applicable Law, if any, may change the time and place of such sale.
(ii) To cause any or all of the Collateral to be transferred into the name of the Administrative Agent or the name or names of the Administrative Agent's nominee or nominees.
(iii) To exercise any and all rights and remedies of the Pledgor under or in respect of the Collateral, including without limitation, any and all rights of the Pledgor to demand or otherwise require payment of any amount under, or performance of any provision of, any of the Collateral and any and all voting rights and other rights, privileges or powers in respect of the Collateral.
 
(iv) To exchange certificated or uncertificated securities that represent the Collateral for one or more securities of larger or smaller denominations.
(v) To exercise all rights of a secured party under the UCC and all other Applicable Laws.
(b) In the case of any permitted sale by the Administrative Agent of the Collateral or any portion thereof (i.e., a sale permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document or Applicable Law) on credit or for future delivery, which may be elected at the option and in the complete discretion of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral so sold may, at the Administrative Agent's option, either be delivered to the purchaser with proper security retained therefor reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or retained by the Administrative Agent until the selling price is paid by the purchaser, but in either event the Administrative Agent shall not incur liability in case of failure of the purchaser to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold. In case of any such failure, such Collateral may again be sold by the Administrative Agent in the manner provided for in this Agreement.
(c) After deducting all of its costs and expenses of every kind, including without limitation, reasonable legal fees and registration fees and expenses, if any, in connection with the permitted sale of the Collateral (i.e., a sale permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document or Applicable Law), the Administrative Agent shall apply the remainder of the proceeds of any sale or sales of the Collateral to the Obligations in the order or priority specified in the Credit Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability by virtue of the fact that a sale of the Collateral occurs at any private sale or sales, and the Pledgor hereby waives any claim arising by reason of the fact that the price or prices for which the Collateral or any portion thereof is sold at such private sale or sales is less than the price that would have been obtained at a public sale or sales or is less than the amounts due under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, even if the Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral or any portion thereof to more than one offeree.
(d) The Pledgor hereby acknowledges and confirms that the Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the Collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, applicable state securities laws or other Applicable Law and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of sophisticated purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire any shares of the Collateral for their own respective accounts for investment and not with a view to distribution or resale thereof. The Pledgor further acknowledges and confirms that any such private sale may result in prices or other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner, and the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to take any steps in order to permit the Collateral to be sold at a public sale. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to delay a sale of any of the Collateral for any period of time necessary to permit any issuer thereof to register such Collateral for public sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under applicable state securities laws or under any other Applicable Law.
6. . The undertakings of the Pledgor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be impaired by: (a) any exercise or non-exercise, or any waiver by the Administrative Agent, of any right, remedy, power or privilege under the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (b) any amendment to or modification of the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents; or (c) the release or discharge or termination of any security or guaranty for any of the Obligations, whether or not the Pledgor shall have notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing. The Administrative Agent's prior recourse to any part or all of the Collateral under the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall not constitute a condition of any demand, suit or proceeding for payment or collection of the Obligations. No act, failure or delay by the Administrative Agent shall constitute a waiver by the Administrative Agent of any of its rights and remedies hereunder or otherwise. No single or partial waiver by the Administrative Agent of any default or right or remedy that it may have shall operate as a waiver of any other default, right or remedy or of the same default, right or remedy on a future occasion. The Pledgor waives presentment, notice of dishonor and protest, notice of intent to accelerate and notice of acceleration of all instruments, documents and agreements included in or evidencing any of the Obligations, and any and all other notices and demands whatsoever (except as may be expressly required under the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents).
No Waiver

This power of attorney is hereby declared to be absolute and irrevocable, with full power of substitution and coupled with an interest, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Full Payment of all of the Obligations. This power of attorney shall extend to and be binding upon each of the Pledgor's successors, assigns and legal representatives. A facsimile signature or other electronically transmitted signature shall be effective if so affixed.
