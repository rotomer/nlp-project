NEW YORK, July 2, 2002 - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that the New Drug Application (NDA) submitted by Lipha S.A. for acamprosate, a medication designed to help maintain abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence, is not approvable at this time. Lipha S.A., a French subsidiary of Merck KGaA based in Darmstadt, Germany, developed acamprosate and licensed the U.S. marketing and distribution rights to Forest Laboratories in October 2001. Lipha's NDA for acamprosate was filed in December 2001, and received a priority review designation from the FDA.
Despite the conclusion from its advisory committee on May 10, 2002 that clinical trial data for acamprosate submitted in the NDA demonstrated efficacy, the FDA, upon completing its review of the application, has indicated that the data submitted did not adequately establish the safety and efficacy of acamprosate. The FDA has requested that at least one additional U.S. clinical trial evaluating safety and efficacy be conducted as well as additional pharmacokinetic analyses and additional pre-clinical studies.
Lipha conducted several multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trials that tested the safety and efficacy of acamprosate in more than 4,500 patients with alcohol dependence. In the trials, acamprosate was shown to consistently increase abstinence rates when used as part of a multidisciplinary approach that included psychosocial or behavioral therapies. The studies also demonstrated that side effects for acamprosate were generally mild, with the most frequently reported side effect being diarrhea Acamprosate is currently approved and available in 24 countries outside the United States and was most recently approved in the United Kingdom in 1995 and in Australia 1999 and Italy in 1999.
