NEW YORK, April 22, 2003 ---- Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: FRX), an international pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer, today reported record revenues and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter and twelve months ended March 31, 2003.
Fourth Quarter Results

Antidepressant sales in last year's fourth quarter were $313,128,000.
Net income in the current quarter increased 87% to $180,737,000 from $96,553,000 reported in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21% to $198,449,000, while research and development spending increased 13% to $51,412,000 during the quarter. Diluted earnings per share equaled $.48 in the current quarter as compared to $.26 in last year's fourth quarter.
Twelve Months Results
Net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 increased to $2,206,706,000, a 41% increase over reported sales for fiscal year 2002 of $1,566,626,000. For the fiscal year, total antidepressant franchise sales were $1,696,709,000 which was comprised of $1,451,979,000 of Celexa and $244,730,000 of Lexapro.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 19% to $715,432,000, while research and development spending increased 30% to $204,883,000 during the year.
Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2003 equaled $1.66 compared to diluted earnings per share of $.91 in fiscal 2002.
Howard Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forest, said: "Our significant growth in earnings this past fiscal year was based principally on increased sales of our highly successful antidepressant products - Celexa and Lexapro. Those products currently account for a higher and growing percentage of new prescriptions for SSRIs than any other products in the category. We expect further growth principally in Lexapro, which we anticipate will be augmented by approval of Lexapro for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the current fiscal year. We are also anticipating that the approval of Aerospan for asthma may occur this year and that the approval of memantine for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's may occur early next fiscal year. We are therefore increasing our salesforce this year as well as our research and development budgets to further support our existing products and their expanded indications and our current products in development, as well as to enable us to undertake new projects.
"At this time, we expect that our projected investment combined with the anticipated continuation of overall market share gains for our antidepressant products is likely to result in earnings per share growth for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2004 of at least 20%."
Forest will host a conference call at 11:00 AM EDT today to discuss the results.
