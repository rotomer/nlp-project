NEW YORK, July 15, 2003 - Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: FRX), an international pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer, today announced that earnings per share equaled $.48 in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, an increase of 45% from the reported $.33 in last year's first quarter. Net sales for the quarter increased 30% to $605,748,000 from $467,189,000 in the prior year. Sales in the quarter included $475,709,000 for Forest's antidepressant franchise which was comprised of $284,717,000 of Celexa (citalopram HBr), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and $190,992,000 of Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), Forest's recently introduced SSRI.
Net income in the current quarter increased 45% to $179,817,000 from $123,828,000 reported in the first quarter of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 24% to $191,494,000 while research and development investment increased 6% to $53,347,000.
Although Forests' total SSRI current market share increased to 22.85% at the end of June from 21.75% at the end of March, total franchise sales declined by $9,224,000 from last year's fourth quarter due to wholesaler inventory levels declining approximately four days from 11.2 days to 7.6 days.
Howard Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forest, said: "During the quarter our antidepressant franchise (Celexa and Lexapro) achieved the leading current market share of both new and total prescriptions for SSRIs. New prescriptions for Lexapro now exceed those of Celexa, and Lexapro's market share increase more than offset the share decline for Celexa. We look forward to a continuation of Lexapro's strength in the market which has been driven by consistent physician and patient response to the clinical attributes of the product." Mr. Solomon continued, "Market share targets for our antidepressant franchise are being achieved although the overall growth rate in prescriptions for the major therapeutic categories in the U.S pharmaceutical industry, including the SSRI category, declined during the quarter, perhaps due to overall economic conditions. Currently, our earnings per share growth target for the fiscal year is approximately 20%, however, should this lower rate of ma rket prescription growth persist for the remainder of the fiscal year it could impact our ability to achieve that rate of earnings growth. We are responding to slower market growth by reviewing discretionary spending items for the balance of the year."
"We currently have several New Drug Applications under review by the Food and Drug Administration including memantine for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease and Lexapro for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. Development also continues for dexloxiglumide for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, neramexane for various central nervous system disorders and several other products. We are pleased that our partner, Sankyo, received regulatory approval for a combination of Benicar* and hydrochlorothiazide during the quarter and look forward to the launch of that product in the upcoming quarter. Forty percent of the market for angiotensin receptor blockers consists of similar combination products. Based on the favorable response of physicians to Benicar and the approval of the combination product, we have agreed with Sankyo to increase our efforts on Benicar during the coming year."
