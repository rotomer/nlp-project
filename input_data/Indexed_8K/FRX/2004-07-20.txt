NEW YORK, July 20, 2004 - Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: FRX), an international pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer, today announced that diluted earnings per share equaled $.60 in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, an increase of 25% from the reported $.48 in last year's first quarter.Net sales for the quarter increased 29% to $782,396,000 from $605,748,000 in the prior year. Sales in the quarter included $624,925,000 for Forest's antidepressant franchise which was comprised of $363,872,000 of Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate) and $261,053,000 of Celexa (citalopram HBr). Lexapro sales were driven by increased prescription volume while Celexa sales were impacted by lower prescription volume which was more than offset by a higher average selling price. The average pricing on Celexa during the quarter was a result of a 4% price increase implemented in early March 2004, elimination of managed-care rebates and greater number of pi lls per Celexa prescription due to the larger proportion of Celexa prescriptions in the mail-order segment. Namenda, our NMDA receptor antagonist for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, recorded sales of $57,368,000 during the quarter.
Net income in the current quarter increased 28% to $229,919,000 from $179,817,000 reported in the first quarter of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 25% to $239,305,000 while research and development spending increased 60% to $85,283,000. Research and development spending included a one-time upfront payment to PAION GmbH for the U.S. and Canadian rights to desmoteplase, a compound being investigated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.
Howard Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forest, said: "Our three principle promoted products, Lexapro, Namenda and the angiotensin receptor blocker Benicar*, which we co-promote with Sankyo Pharma., continued their strong performance during the quarter increasing their respective market shares in response to continued growth in physician acceptance and patient response. The underlying prescription growth rate of the overall antidepressant market continued to grow in line with our previous expectations and we are encouraged by the strong prescription growth rates in the underlying markets for Namenda and Benicar."
Mr. Solomon continued: "Our strong financial performance this quarter will allow us to modify our earnings per share guidance for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2005 by increasing the lower end of our range from $2.35 to $2.40 while maintaining the upper end at $2.50."
Forest will host a conference call at 10:00 AM EDT today to discuss the results.
