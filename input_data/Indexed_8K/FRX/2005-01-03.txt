Other Events
     On December 27, 2004, Forest Laboratories, Inc. ("Forest") was named as a defendant, together with Biovail Corporation, in an action brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under the caption The complaint alleges attempts to monopolize under Section 2 of the Sherman Act with respect to the product Tiazac resulting from Biovail's January 2001 patent listing in the Food and Drug Administration's "Orange Book" of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations. Biovail withdrew the Orange Book listing of the patent at issue following an April 2002 Consent Order between Biovail and the Federal Trade Commission. Biovail is the owner of the NDA covering Tiazac which Forest distributes in the United States under license from Biovail. The action, which purports to be brought as a class action on behalf o f all persons or entities who purchased Tiazac directly from Forest from February 13, 2001 to the present, seeks treble damages and related relief arising from the allegedly unlawful acts. Forest believes there is no merit to the claims asserted against it and intends to vigorously defend this action.
