NEW YORK, January 4, 2005 ---- Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:FRX), an international pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer, today announced that it expects its performance for the fiscal 2005 third quarter ended December 31, 2004 to exceed the current mean estimate. The Company projects that diluted earnings per share will exceed the current First Call mean estimate of $0.59 per share by approximately 15%. In the third quarter of last fiscal year Forest earned $0.60 per share.
The Company indicated that the principal reason for the better than anticipated performance in the quarter is strong net sales volume of approximately $795 million. Sales of its antidepressant Lexapro were approximately $427 million. Sales of the antidepressant Celexa of approximately $130 million during the quarter were negatively impacted due to the introduction of generic versions in November 2004. Sales of Namenda, an NMDA antagonist for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, amounted to approximately $100 million. Branded and generic sales of the antiviral Flumadine totaled approximately $30 million as the US Government placed a one-time order on behalf of the Centers for Disease Control in response to a shortage of flu vaccine. Other income for the quarter included co-promotion earnings from Sankyo of approximately $22 million on the shared profits of Benicar*.
Research and development expense in the quarter was approximately $80 million and includes a payment to Gideon Richter Limited pursuant to the collaboration agreement announced during the quarter.
Fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were approximately 369 million, a reduction of approximately 6 million shares from last quarter primarily due to the Company's previously announced share repurchase program. Forest has cumulatively repurchased 16 million of its shares since the program's inception.
Forest plans to issue its third quarter fiscal 2005 earnings on Tuesday, January 18, 2005 and will hold an investor conference call to discuss the results.
