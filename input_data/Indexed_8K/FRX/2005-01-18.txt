NEW YORK, January 18, 2005 ---- Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:FRX), an international pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer, today reported record revenues and earnings for its fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2004.
Net sales for the quarter increased 14% to $795,047,000 from $700,447,000 in the prior year. Sales in the quarter included $560,640,000 for Forest's antidepressant franchise which was comprised of $427,118,000 of Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), an SSRI indicated for the initial and maintenance treatment of Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and $129,812,000 of Celexa (citalopram HBr), an SSRI for the treatment of Depression. Also included this quarter were $3,710,000 of generic citalopram sold by the Company's Inwood Division. Antidepressant franchise sales in the quarter decreased by 5% as compared to last year's third quarter sales of $587,892,000 due to the introduction of generic versions of Celexa during the quarter. Lexapro's new prescriptions accounted for approximately 74% of the Company's antidepressant new prescriptions prior to the approval of generic versions of Celexa. Sales of Namenda, an NMDA receptor antagonist for the tr eatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, totaled $100,603,000 in the quarter. Sales of Flumadine, an anti-viral, were $34,615,000, which includes a one-time purchase by the U.S. Government of $33,509,000 due to the flu vaccine shortage, while earnings from the co-promotion agreement with Sankyo Pharma for Benicar* and Benicar HCT, antihypertensive therapies, totaled $22,544,000. This was the first full quarter in which Benicar was profitable.
Net income in the current quarter increased by 15% to $260,805,000 as compared to $226,118,000 reported in the third quarter of the prior year. Diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.70 in the current quarter as compared to $0.60 in last year's third quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% to $242,863,000. Research and development spending increased 53% to $77,393,000 during the quarter and included a one-time upfront payment to Gedeon Richter Limited for the U.S. and Canadian rights to RGH-188, a compound being investigated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania.
Nine-month results
Net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 increased 26% to $2,434,123,000 from $1,925,352,000 in the prior year. Antidepressant sales totaled $1,856,878,000 for the nine-month period, an increase of 18% over the prior year's nine-month antidepressant sales of $1,578,745,000.
Net income for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 increased 33% to $786,050,000 from net income of $590,392,000 reported in the nine months of the prior year. Diluted earnings per share increased 33% to $2.09 in the current year's first nine months as compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.57 for last year's nine months.
Howard Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forest, said: "During the quarter our key promoted products continued to exhibit strong performance. This is the first quarter where generic versions of Celexa have been in the marketplace and to date the introduction of generics have not had any meaningful negative impact on the performance of Lexapro nor do we expect any meaningful impact given physicians' experience with Lexapro, its differentiated clinical profile and additional indication in Generalized Anxiety Disorder. While the impact of generic Celexa on our overall business will be noticeable in the short-term, the continued growth of Lexapro, Namenda and Benicar and the launches of Campral* and Combunox will serve to overcome the loss of Celexa revenues during the coming quarters.
Regarding product development during the quarter, we received Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for Combunox for the treatment of acute moderate to severe pain and expect to commence marketing of the product to physicians this coming March. We also entered into a collaboration agreement with Gedeon Richter Limited which represents an important pipeline addition of an anti-psychotic medication that will compliment our existing Central Nervous System franchise. Our Business Development group continues to evaluate interesting potential development drug candidates and we anticipate completing additional collaboration agreements during the coming quarters."
Mr. Solomon continued: "We expect our financial performance for the remainder of this fiscal year ending March 31, 2005 should result in earnings per share of approximately $2.60. Regarding our next fiscal year we plan to offer guidance in conjunction with our fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year-end earnings release which will occur in mid-April."
Forest will host a conference call at 10:00 AM EST today to discuss the results.
