NEW YORK, July 19, 2005 - Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: FRX), an international pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer, today announced that fully diluted earnings per share equaled $0.62 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, which includes a one-time tax benefit due to the recently issued US Treasury Department guidance. This resulted in the reversal of $36.4 million of the $90.7 million in taxesaccrued in the March 2005 quarter related to the repatriation of foreign funds under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Excluding the one-time tax reversal, fully diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $0.52.
Net revenues for the quarter decreased 10% to $711,766,000 from $792,826,000 in the year-ago period.
Net revenues were comprised of net sales, which decreased 14% to $674,653,000 from $782,396,000 in the prior year. Sales in the quarter included $461,072,000 for Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate). Namenda, our NMDA receptor antagonist for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, recorded sales of $114,704,000 during the quarter. The year-ago period included sales of $261,053,000 for branded Celexa (citalopram HBr) compared to branded and generic sales of the product of $4,155,000 in the just reported quarter. Also included in net revenues was other income of $37,113,000 which includes $24,267,000 in earnings contribution from the Benicar* (olmesartan medoxomil) co-promotion agreement. The remaining component of other income was principally interest income.
Net income in the current quarter, including the one-time tax reversal, decreased 6% to $216,577,000 from $229,919,000 in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the one-time tax reversal, net income in the current quarter decreased 22% to $180,163,000. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 12% to $268,473,000 while research and development spending decreased 34% to $56,393,000. Research and development spending in the year-ago period included a one-time upfront payment to PAION GmbH for the U.S. and Canadian rights to desmoteplase, a compound being investigated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.
Fully diluted shares outstanding at June 30, 2005 were 348,043,000, a reduction of 32.9 million shares compared to the year-ago period due mainly to the Company's ongoing share repurchase program. During the just-completed quarter the Company repurchased approximately 8.5million shareswhich increases the total number of shares repurchased since the initial program inception last year to 32.4 million shares. The Company has an additional 22.6 million shares available for repurchase under the existing program, which has no expiration date.
Howard Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forest, said: "Despite losing over $250 million in Celexa sales as compared to the year-ago period due to generic competition, the Company's net revenues were only reduced by $81 million. This is due to the continued strong performance of our key promoted products Lexapro, Namenda and Benicar, all of which achieved record sales and market shares in their respective categories at the end of the quarter.
In addition, during the just-completed quarter the overall antidepressant market, our largest market, has shown some recovery in total prescription volume growth rates, which had been negative, and exhibited slightly positive year-over-year growth during each month in the quarter. Namenda continues to experience increases in the number of physicians prescribing the product as well as continued growth in prescription volume, while Benicar market share and physician prescribing continues to steadily increase."
Mr. Solomon continued: "Regarding our annual financial guidance initially issued on April 19, 2005, Forest continues to expect earnings per share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006 of approximately $2.30 per share as the Company continues to be well positioned for growth with competitive products currently marketed and with a growing product pipeline which includes potentially important products at various stages of development. The earnings per share guidance does not include any potential impact from our ongoing share repurchase program."
