NEW YORK, Oct. 18 -- Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: FRX), an international pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer, today reported earnings for its second quarter ended September 30, 2005.
Revenues for the quarter decreased 16% to $736,472,000 from $881,234,000 in the year-ago period. Revenues were comprised of net sales of $691,633,000, a decrease of 19% from $856,680,000 in the year-ago period and other income of $44,839,000, which increased 83% from $24,554,000 in the year-ago period.
Net sales included $472,442,000 for Forest's antidepressant franchise which was comprised of $467,376,000 of Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), $4,390,000 of Celexa (citalopram HBr), an antidepressant and $676,000 of generic citalopram. The year-ago period included $414,925,000 of Lexapro sales and $256,388,000 of branded Celexa sales. Sales of Namenda, an NMDA receptor antagonist for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, increased 53% to $123,932,000 in the quarter.
Other income included earnings from the co-promotion agreement with Sankyo Pharma for Benicar* and Benicar HCT, antihypertensive therapies, of $31,194,000 and interest income of $12,164,000. Additional contract revenue and other income totaled $1,481,000.
Net income in the current quarter decreased 31% to $204,884,000 from $295,326,000 reported in the second quarter of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% to $253,237,000. Research and development expenses decreased 5% to $65,473,000 during the quarter. Diluted earnings per share decreased 25% to $0.59 in the current quarter as compared to $0.79 in last year's second quarter.
Six Month Results
Revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2005 decreased 13% to $1,448,238,000 from $1,674,060,000 in the prior year.
Net income for the six months ended September 30, 2005 decreased 20% to $421,461,000 from net income of $525,245,000 reported in the six months of the prior year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 13% to $1.21 in the current year's first six months as compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.39 in last year's six months. The six-month earnings per share reflects a one-time tax benefit of $36.4 million, or $0.10 per share, related to the repatriation of foreign funds under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Excluding the one-time tax benefit, fully diluted earnings per share were $1.11.
Fiscal 2006 Guidance
The Company continues to expect adjusted fully diluted earnings per share of approximately $2.30 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, excluding the effect of the one-time tax benefit. Including the one-time tax benefit, reported fully diluted earnings per share are projected to be approximately $2.40. The Company expects that revenues will total approximately $3 billion with net sales slightly exceeding $2.8 billion. Regarding changes to product sales, Lexapro sales are now projected to be slightly more than $1.9 billion and the Company has reduced its forecast for Combunox (Oxycodone HCl and Ibuprofen), an opioid and NSAID combination indicated for the short-term management of acute, moderate to severe pain.
Research and development spending is now forecast at approximately $320 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses are projected to grow approximately 4% to $1.03 billion. The earnings per share guidance does not include the potential impact from additional share repurchases which may be made under the Company's remaining authorization of 22.6 million shares.
Howard Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forest, commented: "We continue to focus on realizing full potential from our currently promoted products as well as expanding our development pipeline in order to assure future growth. Namenda and Benicar continued to exhibit strong performance during the quarter. While the antidepressant market overall exhibited stronger-than-expected prescription volume growth during the quarter, Lexapro's market share remained relatively unchanged as compared to the prior quarter. We will be implementing new programs and introducing various interesting new clinical data to the marketplace designed to improve Lexapro's market share performance."
Mr. Solomon continued: "We view a strong and diverse product pipeline as essential to securing continued growth in earnings for the Company. We are currently evaluating more opportunities than at any time in our past and I expect that we will finalize some of the opportunities in the near term."
"Our patent litigation trial against IVAX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. remains scheduled for December 5, 2005 and we remain confident in the validity of the Lexapro patent. We are pleased to have recently entered into a settlement agreement regarding the patent litigation with Alphapharm Pty Ltd. and view the agreed upon terms of the settlement as consistent with our view of our patent's validity."
Forest will host a conference call at 10:00 AM EDT today to discuss the results.
