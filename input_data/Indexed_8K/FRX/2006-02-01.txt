In connection with the appointment of Herschel S. Weinstein, Esq. as the new Vice President-General Counsel of Forest Laboratories, Inc. (the "Company") effective January 30, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Weinstein that provides for an annual base salary of $450,000, a one time signing bonus of $35,000 and eligibility to receive an annual bonus based on performance (targeted at 30% of annual base salary). In addition, the agreement provides for a stock option grant as of January 30, 2006 covering 50,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an exercise price of $45.025 per share, with options vesting pursuant to a vesting schedule over a period of 5 years from the date of grant. The agreement has a three year term, limited to the payment of the agreed compensation and benefits for the three year period commencing with the date of Mr. Weinstein's employment and also provides for other benefits to be made available to Mr. Weinstein to the extent generally made available by the Company to its senior executive officers.
In addition, as of January 30, 2006 the Company and Mr. Weinstein entered into a "Change in Control" Employment Agreement which becomes effective only upon the occurrence of a "change in control" and provides that Mr. Weinstein is entitled to salary, bonus and benefits for a three year period following a "change in control" of the Company if his employment terminates during such period without cause or for good reason.
