NEW YORK, October 17, 2006 - Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: FRX), an international pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer, today announced that fully diluted earnings per share equaled $0.75 in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, an increase of 27% over last years second quarters fully diluted earnings per share of $0.59. Reported earnings included a $9.1 million charge for stock option expense in accordance with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 123R.
Net revenues for the quarter increased 15% to $846,975,000 from $736,472,000 in the year-ago period. Net revenues were comprised of net sales, which increased 13% to $778,676,000 from $691,633,000 in the prior year. Sales in the quarter included $522,662,000 for Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), our SSRI for the treatment of depression and anxiety in adults, an increase of 12% from the year-ago period. Namenda, our NMDA receptor antagonist for the treatment of moderate and severe Alzheimers disease, recorded sales of $155,586,000 during the quarter, growth of 26% from last year. Also included in net revenues was other income of $68,299,000 which includes $48,315,000 in earnings contribution from the Benicar* (olmesartan medoxomil) co-promotion agreement, an increase of 55%. The remaining component of other income was principally interest income.
Net income in the current quarter increased 18% to $241,111,000 from $204,884,000 reported in the second quarter of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2% to $259,008,000. Research and development expenses increased 43% to $93,752,000 during the quarter.
Fully diluted shares outstanding at September 30, 2006 were 322,581,000 a reduction of 23 million shares compared to the year-ago period due mainly to the Companys ongoing share repurchase program. During the just-completed quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares leaving an additional 16 million shares available for repurchase under the existing program, which has no expiration date.
Six Month Results
Revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2006 increased 15% to $1,663,313,000 from $1,448,238,000 in the prior year.
Net income for the six months ended September 30, 2006 increased 5% to $441,718,000 from net income of $421,461,000 reported in the six months of the prior year. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $1.36 in the current years first six months as compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.21 in last years six months. The year-ago six-month earnings per share reflect a one-time tax benefit of $36.4 million, or $0.10 per share, related to the repatriation of foreign funds under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Excluding the one-time tax benefit, year-ago fully diluted earnings per share were $1.11.
Fiscal 2007 Guidance
Based on the stronger-than-projected performance of our promoted products, accretion from shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date, and shifting approximately $43 million in planned product milestone payments into next fiscal year, the Company has increased its expectations for fully diluted earning per share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007 to $2.60-$2.65 from prior guidance of $2.45-$2.50 per share. The earnings per share guidance does not include the potential impact from additional share repurchases which may be made under the Companys remaining authorization of 16 million shares.
Howard Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forest, commented: "We are very pleased with the continued strong performance of our key marketed products: Lexapro, Namenda and Benicar. Given this performance as well as accretion from our significant share repurchases, Forest is now projecting a level of annual earnings per share that meaningfully exceeds our prior record level achieved in fiscal 2005, the last year of Celexas exclusivity. At the same time the Company is also significantly increasing its investment in research and development.
This investment will support the continued development of current pipeline products as well as allow the Company to continue to expand the product pipeline. The ultimate goal and key focus of the Company is to successfully license, develop and commercialize a next generation of Forest products that will ultimately more than replace profits from todays key products which lose exclusivity in the early part of the next decade."
Forest will host a conference call at 10:00 AM EDT today to discuss the results. The conference call will be webcast live beginning at 10:00 AM EDT on the Companys website at www.frx.com and also on the website www.streetevents.com.
