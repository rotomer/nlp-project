Diluted earnings per share increased 20% to $2.14 in the current years first nine months as compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.79 for last years nine months.
Fiscal 2007 Guidance
Based on the stronger-than-projected performance of our promoted products, the Company has increased its expectations for fully diluted earning per share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007 to $2.79-$2.84 from prior guidance of $2.60-$2.65 per share. The revised guidance excludes the impact of the one-time in-process research and development charge related to the acquisition of Cerexa, Inc. of approximately $494 million, or approximately $1.54 per share. This charge will be recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter and is subject to final purchase price valuation and allocation. The revised estimate of per share effect of the charge recognizes that there is no deferred tax benefit to be reflected. In addition, the revised earnings per share guidance does include planned research and development expenses associated with Cerexa related product development programs.
Howard Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forest, said: "We are encouraged by both the performance of our key marketed products and by the opportunities we currently have in our development pipeline as well as the prospect to add future development programs. During the quarter we announced the acquisition of Cerexa, Inc. Our acquisition of Cerexa provides us with major opportunities in an entirely new therapeutic area, the hospital injectable anti-infective market, which urgently needs innovative drugs because of the persistent and inevitable development of increased resistance to existing antibiotics. We believe Cerexa is an outstanding company, with extraordinary leadership and scientists that we expect will become a major source of growth for Forest. Cerexas most advanced product, ceftaroline, will shortly be commencing Phase III studies.
We remain strategically focused on both supporting continued growth of our in-line products, which generate predictable and significant free cash flow, as well as identifying promising development opportunities."
Forest will host a conference call at 10:00 AM EST today to discuss the results.
