Fiscal 2008 Guidance
Regarding the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008, the Company expects that reported fully diluted earnings per share will be approximately $3.05 to $3.15, including planned milestone payments of approximately $85 million.
Key assumptions supporting the fiscal year forecast include the following:
The Company anticipates that total revenue in fiscal 2008, which includes product sales as well as the earnings contribution from Benicar, interest income and other income, will increase by approximately 8% from the $3.44 billion reported in fiscal 2007. Net sales are also projected to increase by approximately 8% during fiscal 2008.
For Lexapro, the Company projects an increase in overall prescription volume for the underlying SSRI/SNRI antidepressant market as a whole of approximately 3% and an increase in Lexapros total prescription market share of approximately ten basis points. This increase in market growth as well as market share, along with a price increase, is projected to generate Lexapro sales growth of between 9-10% from the reported sales of $2,105,990,000 in fiscal year 2007. We anticipate that Namenda sales should grow approximately 14-16% from the $660,295,000 reported in fiscal 2007.
Earnings from Benicar in fiscal 2008 are expected to grow nearly 15% from $174,566,000 reported in fiscal 2007.
The fiscal 2008 projection includes an approximate 9% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to approximately $1.15 billion. This expense includes funding continued competitive levels of support behind currently promoted products and pre-launch and launch expenses to support nebivolol, which is expected to launch during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008 pending FDA approval for an indication of hypertension. The Company does not plan to make any significant modifications to the size of its salesforce at this point in time.
Research and development spending is expected to be approximately $550,000,000 in support of a dramatically increased late-stage product pipeline. This projection includes planned milestone payments of approximately $85,000,000, however, the projection does not include any licensing or milestone payments which may be made for additional product development transactions or acquisitions that may occur during the fiscal year. During fiscal 2008, the Company will be investing heavily in five late stage development projects, including ceftaroline, an injectable cephalosporin which is being developed for complicated skin and skin structure infections and community acquired pneumonia, aclidinium (LAS34273), which is being developed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, milnacipran for the treatment of fibromyalgia, desmoteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and memantine MR for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimers disease.
The Company is projecting an effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 of 21%, consistent with the tax rate for fiscal 2007. The Company also forecasts that fully diluted shares outstanding will increase by approximately 1.9 million shares to an average of approximately 325,000,000.
Howard Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forest, said: "Fiscal 2007 was another strong year for Forest and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our key marketed products. We also had another successful year related to business development activities as we continued to expand our product development pipeline.
Fiscal 2008 will be an important year for Forest as we expect over the next two months to receive Phase III clinical data for both milnacipran, being investigated for fibromyalgia and desmoteplase for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. We also have two additional significant Phase III clinical programs underway. One program is for ceftaroline, an injectable cephalosporin antibiotic and the other for aclidinium (LAS 32471), being investigated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. We are also conducting a Phase III study in moderate to severe Alzheimers disease for a modified release form of Namenda as well as a Phase III study for Lexapro in adolescent patients and expect to receive results for both programs later in the fiscal year. We intend to make a significant investment in our development pipeline this year as we advance several important product opportunities. We also expect to launch nebivolol, a next-generation beta blocker under FDA review for an indication of hypertension later in the fiscal year pending FDA marketing approval. We believe that the significant cash flow generated from our marketed products will enable the Company to invest appropriately behind sales and marketing and increased levels of research and development activities while also generating earnings per share growth rates."
