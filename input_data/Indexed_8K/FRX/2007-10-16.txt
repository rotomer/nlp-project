NEW YORK, October 16, 2007 - Forest Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE: FRX), an international pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer, today announced that fully diluted reported earnings per share equaled $0.71 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, a decrease of 5% over last years second quarters fully diluted reported earnings per share of $0.75. Reported earnings per share were reduced by the effect of a $70 million licensing charge, equivalent to $0.15 per share net of tax, to Microbia, Inc. for the right to co-develop and co-market linaclotide, a compound being investigated for chronic constipation and constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
Revenues for the quarter increased 8.5% to $918,960,000 from $846,975,000 in the year-ago period. Revenues were comprised of net sales, which increased 8.2% to $842,337,000 from $778,676,000 in the prior year. Sales in the quarter included $559,063,000 for Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), our SSRI for the treatment of depression and anxiety in adults, an increase of 7% from the year-ago period. Namenda, our NMDA receptor antagonist for the treatment of moderate and severe Alzheimers disease, recorded sales of $192,872,000 during the quarter, growth of 24% from last year. Product wholesalers collectively held less inventory of both Lexapro and Namenda at the end of the September quarter which negatively impacted combined sales of these products by approximately $18,000,000. Wholesaler inventory levels for both products are currently at approximately two weeks of sales. Also included in net revenues was other income of $76,623,000 which includes a 2.6% increase to $49,572,000 in earnings contribution from the Benicar* (olmesartan medoxomil) co-promotion agreement. The remaining component of other income was principally interest income.
Net income in the current quarter decreased 7% to $225,244,000 from $241,111,000 reported in the second quarter of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% to $280,439,000. Research and development expenses increased 82% to $170,738,000 during the quarter which included the $70,000,000 licensing charge made in connection with the Microbia agreement.
Fully diluted shares outstanding at September 30, 2007 were 316,852,000 a reduction of 5.7 million shares compared to the year-ago period due mainly to the Companys ongoing share repurchase program. During the just-completed quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 4.95 million shares leaving an additional 17.9 million shares available for repurchase under the existing program, which has no expiration date.
Six Month Results
Revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2007 increased 11.1% to $1,847,234,000 from $1,663,313,000 in the prior year.
Net income for the six months ended September 30, 2007 increased 12% to $493,406,000 from net income of $441,718,000 reported in the six months of the prior year. Reported diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.54 in the current years first six months as compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.36 in last years six months.
Fiscal 2008 Guidance
The Company now projects that earnings per share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008 will be in a range of $3.10 to $3.20 as compared to prior guidance of a range of $3.05 to $3.15. This guidance excludes the $70 million, equal to $0.15 per share net of tax, licensing charge made in connection with the Microbia agreement, as it was not included in the prior guidance. Research and development spending is expected to be approximately $530 million excluding the $70 million licensing charge.
Howard Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forest, commented: "During the quarter we concluded arrangements with our co-partner Daiichi Sankyo for the launch of Azor, which is occurring this month. In addition, we expect nebivolol to be approved this quarter with a launch scheduled for the fiscal fourth quarter. Both products, with income benefits extending beyond 2012, should soon begin to contribute to earnings. We also expect to file the new drug application for milnacipran this quarter. In addition to the new product launches our core product sales continue to grow and our development pipeline has also advanced. In addition to the results we just announced for RGH-188 for schizophrenia, we expect to see clinical data on five additional later stage studies during the coming year.
During the quarter we announced a collaboration with Microbia for the co-development and co-marketing of linaclotide, for chronic constipation and constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome. We believe this is a promising novel compound that may offer a much needed therapy for this very large and underserved market. Linaclotide, which has already concluded small Phase II studies, is presently being studied in larger Phase II studies with results expected during the first half of 2008."
Forest will host a conference call at 10:00 AM EDT today to discuss the results.
