Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Merger Agreement
 
On February 22, 2011, Forest Laboratories, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), with Clinical Data, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Clinical Data), FL Holding CV, an entity organized under the laws of the Netherlands and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (FL Holding), and Magnolia Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of FL Holding (Magnolia).
 
Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Magnolia will commence a tender offer (the Offer) to acquire (i) all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Clinical Data (Clinical Data Common Stock) for (A) $30.00 per share of Clinical Data Common Stock (the Upfront Payment), net to the holder thereof in cash and less any withholding taxes, and (B) a non-transferable contractual right to receive one or more contingent payments, of up to $6.00 per share of Clinical Data Common Stock in total, upon the achievement of certain milestones (the Contingent Consideration), pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Contingent Value Right Agreement described below, (ii) all of the outstanding warrants to purchase s hares of Clinical Data Common Stock that have exercise prices of $36.00 per share of Clinical Data Common Stock or less (Clinical Data Warrants) for the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (iii) all of the outstanding convertible promissory notes (Clinical Data Notes) issued by Clinical Data on February 25, 2009 in the aggregate principal amount of $50,000,000, for the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement.
 
As soon as practicable after the consummation of the Offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Magnolia will merge with and into Clinical Data (the Merger) and Clinical Data will become a wholly owned subsidiary of FL Holding.  The Merger Agreement also provides that if the Offer is not completed, the Merger may be able to be consummated if the stockholders of Clinical Data adopt the Merger Agreement at a meeting of such stockholders (the One-Step Merger).  In the Merger, each outstanding share of Clinical Data Common Stock, other than shares of Clinical Data Common Stock owned by Clinical Data, FL Holding, Magnolia or any of their respective subsidiaries or by Clinical Data stockholders who have validly exercised their appraisal rights under Delaware law, will be converted into the right to receive the consideration per share of Clinical Data Common Stock that would have been payable in the Offer.  In addition, in the Merger, Clinical Data Warrants and Clinical Data Notes will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the consideration that would have been paid for them in the Offer.
 
The obligation of Magnolia to purchase shares of Clinical Data Common Stock, Clinical Data Warrants and Clinical Data Notes tendered in the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the obtainment of any governmental approvals that may be required, and the consummation of the Offer or the Merger not being made unlawful under applicable laws or prohibited by any court of competent jurisdiction, and other customary closing conditions.  In addition, it is a condition to Magnolias obligation to purchase the shares of Clinical Data Common Stock, Clinical Data Warrants and Clinical Data Notes tendered in the Offer th at the number of shares of Clinical Data Common Stock, Clinical Data Warrants and Clinical Data Notes that have been tendered and not validly withdrawn, together with any shares of Clinical Data Common Stock beneficially owned by FL Holding and its affiliates plus the number of shares of Clinical Data Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the Top-Up Option (as described below), equals at least one more than 90% of the total number of shares of Clinical Data Common Stock outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer calculated on a fully diluted basis plus the number of shares of Clinical Data Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the Minimum Condition).  In the event that the conditions to the Offer, including the Minimum Condition, are not met, the parties have agreed to complete the Merger without the prior completion of the Offer, after receipt of the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Clinical Data Common Stock for the adoption of the Merger Agreement.  In that case, the consummation of the Merger would be subject to similar conditions as the conditions to the Offer, other than the addition of the stockholder approval requirement and the inapplicability of the Minimum Condition.
 
Clinical Data has also granted to FL Holding and Magnolia an option (the Top-Up Option), which may be exercised by FL Holding or Magnolia, or at the request of Clinical Data, shall be exercised by FL Holding or Magnolia, following the consummation of the Offer, to purchase from Clinical Data, subject to the total number of authorized shares, the number of shares of Clinical Data Common Stock that, when added to the number of outstanding shares of Clinical Data Common Stock owned by Magnolia at the time of the exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one more than 90% of the number of shares of Clinical Data Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of Clinical Data Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option calculated on a fully diluted basis (disregarding, however, any shares of Cl inical Data Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Clinical Data Notes or exercise of Clinical Data Warrants acquired by Magnolia in the Offer).  If FL Holding, Magnolia and any of their respective affiliates acquire more than 90% of the outstanding shares of Clinical Data Common Stock, including through exercise of the Top-Up Option, FL Holding will cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable without a meeting of Clinical Datas stockholders in accordance with Delaware law, including by means of the short form procedures available under Delaware law.
 
The Merger Agreement prohibits Clinical Data from soliciting or initiating discussions with third parties regarding other proposals to acquire Clinical Data and Clinical Data has agreed to certain restrictions on its ability to respond to such proposals, subject to the fulfillment of certain fiduciary requirements of Clinical Datas Board of Directors under Delaware law.  The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for FL Holding and Clinical Data including, with respect to Clinical Data, in the event that Clinical Data receives a superior proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement).  In connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including with respect to Clinical Datas entry into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, Clinical Data is r equired to pay to FL Holding a termination fee equal to $45,000,000.  In addition, in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances during the pendency of a publicly disclosed third party proposal to acquire Clinical Data, Clinical Data is required to reimburse FL Holding for FL Holdings fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Offer and the Merger up to an aggregate amount of $7,500,000, and, if Clinical Data enters into an agreement for a third party to acquire Clinical Data within 12 months of such termination, to pay to FL Holding the balance of the $45,000,000 termination fee less any such reimbursed expenses.
 
The description of the Merger Agreement contained herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for transactions of this type.  The Merger Agreement is attached to provide the Companys stockholders with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement and is not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about the Company or its subsidiaries or Clinical Data in the Companys or Clinical Datas respective public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).  In particular, the Merger Agreement and this summary of terms are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts or circumstances relating to the Company or its subsidiaries or Clinical Data.  The representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement were negotiated with the principal purposes of (i) establishing the circumstances under which Magnolia may have the right not to consummate the Offer or the Merger, or FL Holding or Clinical Data may have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement, and (ii) allocating risk between the parties if those representations and warranties should prove to be inaccurate, rather than as statements of fact.  The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the Merger Agreement among Clinical Data, the Company, FL Holding and Magnolia and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by Clinical Data, the Company, FL Holding and Magnolia in connection with the negotiated terms thereof.  Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date and may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable under f ederal securities laws.  Clinical Datas stockholders and other investors are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of Clinical Data, the Company, FL Holding, Magnolia or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.
 
Securityholder Tender and Support Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, FL Holding and Magnolia entered into the Securityholder Tender and Support Agreement, dated as of February 22, 2011 (the Support Agreement), with the officers and directors of Clinical Data and certain affiliates thereof, in their capacities as stockholders of Clinical Data, pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed to tender, and not withdraw, all shares of Clinical Data Common Stock beneficially owned by them, or acquired by them after such date, and all Clinical Data Warrants and Clinical Data Notes beneficially owned by them (collectively, Subject Securities) in the Offer upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Support Agreement and, to the extent necessary, vote in favor of the Merger and against any action that would reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the Merger, including any proposal to acquire Clinical Data by a third party.  The stockholders party to the Support Agreement have also granted FL Holding an irrevocable proxy to vote such in accordance with the preceding sentence.  The Support Agreement limits the ability of the stockholders party thereto to sell or otherwise transfer, encumber or grant any proxies in respect of their Subject Securities.  The Support Agreement will terminate upon certain circumstances, including upon termination of the Merger Agreement or upon notice by FL Holding.
any outstanding shares of Clinical Data Common Stock owned by them

As of February 22, 2011, the stockholders party to the Support Agreement beneficially owned 11,271,500 outstanding shares of Clinical Data Common Stock, representing approximately 36.32% of all shares of Clinical Data Common Stock outstanding as of February 17, 2011, and beneficially owned Clinical Data Warrants exercisable for 3,824,011 shares of Clinical Data Common Stock and Clinical Data Notes convertible into 6,110,599 shares of Clinical Data Common Stock.

The former holders of shares of Clinical Data Common Stockoptions to acquire shares of Clinical Data Common Stock, and the former holders of Clinical Data Warrants and Clinical Data Notes, will be entitled to receive the following cash payments for each share of Clinical Data Common Stock acquired by Magnolia in the Offer or converted into the right to receive merger consideration in the Merger (or, in the case of options to acquire shares of Clinical Data Common Stock, and Clinical Data Warrants and Clinical Data Notes, each share of Clinical Data Common Stock that would have been issuable upon the exercise or conversion thereof), with each payment conditioned upon the achievement of the applicable milestone related to the commercialization of Viibryd as follows:
, deferred stock units and
deferred stock units and
 
 
 
 
The five, six and seven year periods described above may be extended in the event that the commercial launch of Viibryd occurs more than six months after the completion of the Merger in certain circumstances.  The terms of the Contingent Consideration described above reflect the parties agreement over the sharing of potential economic upside benefits from future net sales of Viibryd or other products containing vilazodone hydrochloride in the United States and do not necessarily reflect anticipated sales of the product.  There can be no assurance that such levels of net sales will occur or that any or all of the Contingent Consideration payments will be made.
 
The right to the Contingent Consideration as evidenced by the CVR Agreement is a contractual right only and will not be transferable, except in the limited circumstances specified in the CVR Agreement.
 
The foregoing description of the CVR Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the CVR Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to any CVR issued pursuant to Section 3.6(h) of the Merger Agreement in respect of a Company Option having an exercise price greater than $30 per share of Company Common Stock, Parent shall be entitled to deduct from the Milestone Payments to the applicable Holder in respect of such CVR, the amount by which the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such Company Option exceeded $30.

Table of Contents
) certifying the Milestone(s) that have not occurred and that Parent has complied with its obligations under this Agreement.
Milestone Payment Non-Compliance Certificate
 
(c)
 
The Rights Agent shall promptly, and in no event later than ten Business Days after receipt, send each Holder at its registered address a copy of any certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to this Section 2.4.  If in such certificate Parent certifies that a Milestone Payment is payable to the Holders, then at the time the Rights Agent sends a copy of such certificate to the Holders, the Rights Agent shall also pay the Milestone Payment to each of the Holders (the amount to which each Holder is entitled to receive will be based on the Milestone Payment multiplied by the number of CVRs held by such Holder as reflected on the CVR Register) by check mailed to the address of each Holder as reflected in the CVR Register as of the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Milestone Payment Date.
 
(d)
 
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from the Milestone Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.  Prior to making any such tax withholdings or causing any such tax withholdings to be made with respect to any Holder, the Rights Agent shall, to the extent practicable, provide notice to the Holder of such potential withholding and a reasonable opportunity for the Holder to provide any necessary tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or an applicable IRS Form W-8) in order to avoid or reduce such withholding amounts.
 
(e)
 
Any portion of the  Milestone Payment that remains undistributed to the Holders for six months after the Milestone Payment Date shall be delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any Holder shall thereafter look only to Parent or Guarantor for payment of such Milestone Payment, but shall have no greater rights against Parent or Guarantor than may be accorded to general unsecured creditors of Parent under applicable law.
 
(f)
 
Neither Parent nor the Rights Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of the  Milestone Payment delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  If any portion of a Milestone Payment made by Parent remains unclaimed by a Holder prior to two years after the applicable Milestone Payment Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Milestone Payment would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), despite the Rights Agents commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the payment to a Holder, any such Milestone Payment shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, bec ome the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
 
(g)
 
Product Sales for one or more quarterly periods may be used as part of multiple Milestone Performance Periods (assuming such use satisfies the criteria requiring four consecutive quarters).  For example, the results for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 may be part of the Milestone Performance Period ending on such date, or such quarter may be the first, second or third quarter of a different Milestone Performance Period.  A single Milestone
 
 
Table of Contents
Performance Period can be used to measure the attainment of more than one Milestone.  If a single Milestone Performance Period reflects Product Sales that would satisfy more than one Milestone, then the Milestone Payment with respect to all Milestones achieved during the Milestone Performance Period shall be paid.  For example, if no Milestones have been attained prior to December 31, 2014, but the Product Sales for the Milestone Performance Period ending on December 31, 2014 are $1.5 billion, then the Milestone Payments associated with Milestone #1, Milestone #2 and Milestone #3 shall be paid ($6 per CVR).
 
2.5
 
No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest in Parent.
 
(a)
 
The CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest shall not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder, except as specifically provided herein.
 
(b)
 
The CVRs shall not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent or in any constituent company to the Merger.
 
2.6
 
.  The Holder of a CVR may at any time at its option abandon all of its remaining rights in a CVR by transferring the CVR to Parent without consideration therefor.  Nothing in this Section 2.6 is intended to prohibit Parent from offering to acquire CVRs for consideration in its sole discretion.

 means (i) if (A) Commercial Launch occurs on or prior to the six month anniversary of the Effective Time or (B) Commercial Launch occurs after the six month anniversary of the Effective Time but not in circumstances constituting an Unexcused Delay, then, if the Effective Time occurs on or prior to the 45th calendar day of a given calendar quarter, the last calendar day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the calendar quarter in which the Effective Time occurs, and if the Effective Time occurs after the 45th calendar day of a given calendar quarter, the last calendar day of the calendar quarter in which the Effective Time occurs; and (ii) if Commercial Launch occurs after the six month anniversary of the Effective Time in circumstances constituting an Unexcused Delay, then, if the Adjusted Effective Time occurs on or prior to the 45th calendar day of a given calendar quarter, the last calendar day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the calendar quarter in which the Adjusted Effective Time occurs, and if the Adjusted Effective Time occurs after the 45th calendar day of a given calendar quarter, the last calendar day of the calendar quarter in which the Adjusted Effective Time occurs.

Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions herein (including the provisions of Secti on 2.2), register the transfer of the CVRs in the CVR Register.  All duly transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register shall be the valid obligations of Parent, evidencing the same right, and shall entitle the transferee to the same benefits and rights under this Agreement, as those held by the transferor.  No transfer of a CVR shall be valid until registered in the CVR Register, and any transfer not duly registered in the CVR Register will be void ab initio.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to any CVR issued pursuant to Section 3.6(h) of the Merger Agreement in respect of a Company Option having an exercise price greater than $30 per share of Company Common Stock, Parent shall be entitled to deduct from the Milestone Payments to the applicable Holder in respect of such CVR, the amount by which the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under such Company Option exceeded $30.

) certifying the Milestone(s) that have not occurred and that Parent has complied with its obligations under this Agreement.
Milestone Payment Non-Compliance Certificate
 
(c)
 
The Rights Agent shall promptly, and in no event later than ten Business Days after receipt, send each Holder at its registered address a copy of any certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to this Section 2.4.  If in such certificate Parent certifies that a Milestone Payment is payable to the Holders, then at the time the Rights Agent sends a copy of such certificate to the Holders, the Rights Agent shall also pay the Milestone Payment to each of the Holders (the amount to which each Holder is entitled to receive will be based on the Milestone Payment multiplied by the number of CVRs held by such Holder as reflected on the CVR Register) by check mailed to the address of each Holder as reflected in the CVR Register as of the close of business on the last Business Day prior to the Milestone Payment Date.
 
(d)
 
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from the Milestone Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Body, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.  Prior to making any such tax withholdings or causing any such tax withholdings to be made with respect to any Holder, the Rights Agent shall, to the extent practicable, provide notice to the Holder of such potential withholding and a reasonable opportunity for the Holder to provide any necessary tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or an applicable IRS Form W-8) in order to avoid or reduce such withholding amounts.
 
(e)
 
Any portion of the  Milestone Payment that remains undistributed to the Holders for six months after the Milestone Payment Date shall be delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any Holder shall thereafter look only to Parent or Guarantor for payment of such Milestone Payment, but shall have no greater rights against Parent or Guarantor than may be accorded to general unsecured creditors of Parent under applicable law.
 
(f)
 
Neither Parent nor the Rights Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of the  Milestone Payment delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.  If any portion of a Milestone Payment made by Parent remains unclaimed by a Holder prior to two years after the applicable Milestone Payment Date (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Milestone Payment would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), despite the Rights Agents commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the payment to a Holder, any such Milestone Payment shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, bec ome the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
 
(g)
 
Product Sales for one or more quarterly periods may be used as part of multiple Milestone Performance Periods (assuming such use satisfies the criteria requiring four consecutive quarters).  For example, the results for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 may be part of the Milestone Performance Period ending on such date, or such quarter may be the first, second or third quarter of a different Milestone Performance Period.  A single Milestone
 
 
 
 
Performance Period can be used to measure the attainment of more than one Milestone.  If a single Milestone Performance Period reflects Product Sales that would satisfy more than one Milestone, then the Milestone Payment with respect to all Milestones achieved during the Milestone Performance Period shall be paid.  For example, if no Milestones have been attained prior to December 31, 2014, but the Product Sales for the Milestone Performance Period ending on December 31, 2014 are $1.5 billion, then the Milestone Payments associated with Milestone #1, Milestone #2 and Milestone #3 shall be paid ($6 per CVR).
 
2.5
 
No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership Interest in Parent.
 
(a)
 
The CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest shall not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder, except as specifically provided herein.
 
(b)
 
The CVRs shall not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent or in any constituent company to the Merger.
 
2.6
 
.  The Holder of a CVR may at any time at its option abandon all of its remaining rights in a CVR by transferring the CVR to Parent without consideration therefor.  Nothing in this Section 2.6 is intended to prohibit Parent from offering to acquire CVRs for consideration in its sole discretion.
Ability To Abandon The CVR
