Original Report
) to announce the preliminary results of the Companys 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on August 15, 2012 (
2012 Annual Meeting
).  This Amendment is being filed to disclose the final voting results received from IVS Associates, Inc. (
IVS

Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
On August 23, 2012, IVS delivered its final vote tabulation that certified the voting results for each of the matters set forth below that were submitted to a vote at the 2012 Annual Meeting.
Proposal 1

. Each of the following ten director nominees were elected by a plurality of votes as directors for terms expiring at the Companys next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or until his or her successor has been elected or appointed:  Howard Solomon, Nesli Basgoz, M.D., Christopher J. Coughlin, Kenneth E. Goodman, Pierre Legault, Gerald M. Lieberman, Lawrence S. Olanoff, M.D., Ph.D., Lester B. Salans, M.D., Brenton L. Saunders and Peter J. Zimetbaum, M.D. 
The final voting results from the 2012 Annual Meeting as reported by IVS are provided below.  In addition, IVS has advised the Company that there were no broker non-votes for Proposal 1.
 
 
 
 
Proposal 2
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
. The stockholders approved (on an advisory basis) the compensation of the Companys named executive officers, as disclosed in the Companys definitive proxy statement filed on July 9, 2012 for the 2012 Annual Meeting (the 
Proxy Statement
) pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2012 Summary Compensation Table and the tabular disclosure regarding such compensation and the accompanying narrative disclosure, and the final voting results as reported by IVS are provided below.  IVS has advised the Company that there were no broker non-votes for Proposal 2.
Proposal 3
Ratification of Independent Auditors
. The stockholders ratified the appointment of BDO USA, LLP as the Companys Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, and the final voting results as reported by IVS are provided below.  IVS has advised the Company that there were no broker non-votes for Proposal 3.
Proposal 4
Stockholder Proposal Regarding Proxy Access
. The stockholders rejected the stockholder proposal requesting that the Board amend the Companys Bylaws to allow stockholders to nominate director candidates for inclusion in the Companys proxy materials, and the final voting results as reported by IVS are provided below.  IVS has advised the Company that there were no broker non-votes for Proposal 4.
 
As reported in the Original Report, a fifth matter scheduled to be voted upon at the 2012 Annual Meeting and described in the Proxy Statement was a stockholder proposal submitted by Icahn Capital LP and certain affiliated entities, which are a group of hedge funds led by Carl Icahn (collectively, the 
Icahn Group
) that would repeal any provision of the Companys Bylaws in effect at the time of the 2012 Annual Meeting that was not included in the Companys Bylaws as publicly filed prior to June 18, 2012.  As no amendments to the Companys Bylaws as publicly filed prior to June 18, 2012 had been adopted, a representative of the Icahn Group agreed to withdraw the proposal on behalf of the Icahn Group, and the Icahn Group proposal was not included in the matters voted upon at the 2012 Annual Meeting.
