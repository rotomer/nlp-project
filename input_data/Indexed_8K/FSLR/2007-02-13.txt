News Release
 First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, ended December 30, 2006. Quarterly revenues were $52.7 million, up from $40.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and up from $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Revenues for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 were $135.0 million, up from $48.1 million in fiscal year 2005.
PHOENIX, AZ  February 13, 2007
Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $8.0 million or $0.11 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis, compared to net income of $4.3 million or $0.06 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and a net loss of $7.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 or $(0.11) per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis. Net income for fiscal 2006 was $4.0 million or $0.05 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis compared to a net loss of $6.5 million for fiscal 2005 or $(0.10) per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis.
Pro forma earnings per share have been adjusted for the three months ended December 30, 2006, September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, to give effect to the Company's initial public offering as of the beginning of fiscal 2005. The pro forma earnings per share reflect the issuance of the Company's common stock in its initial public offering. The Company believes the pro forma earnings per share presentation represents a meaningful basis for the comparison of its current results to results during fiscal periods occurring prior the Company's initial public offering.
 
On a GAAP fully diluted basis, net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $0.12 per share, compared to $0.07 per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $(0.14) per share on a GAAP fully diluted basis. Also on a GAAP fully diluted basis, net income for fiscal 2006 was $0.07 per share compared to a net loss of $(0.13) per share for fiscal 2005.
"During the fourth quarter we recognized the full benefit of our Ohio expansion, resulting in 25MW of production at that plant during the quarter. The strong sequential increase in throughput reduced our manufacturing cost per watt to $1.25 for the fourth quarter, a 12% reduction from the third quarter of 2006. In addition, completion of our German manufacturing plant is on schedule, and the German plant will provide us with additional capacity to fulfill continued strong customer demand for our products," said Michael J. Ahearn, Chief Executive Officer of First Solar.
