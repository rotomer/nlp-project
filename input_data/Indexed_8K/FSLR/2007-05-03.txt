News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007. Quarterly revenues were $66.9 million, up from $52.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and up from $13.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
PHOENIX, AZ  May 3, 2007
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $5.0 million or $0.07 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to net income of $8.0 million or $0.11 per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and a net loss of $5.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 or $(0.08) per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis.
Pro-forma earnings per share for the three months ended December 30, 2006 and April 1, 2006 have been adjusted to give effect to the Company's equity offerings during 2006, including its initial public offering, as if each occurred on January 1, 2006. The Company believes the pro-forma earnings per share presentation represents a meaningful basis for the comparison of its current results to results during fiscal periods occurring prior to the Company's initial public offering.
On a GAAP fully diluted basis, net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $0.07 per share, compared to $0.12 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Net loss for the first quarter of 2006 was $(0.12) per share on a GAAP fully diluted basis.
"During the first quarter we benefited from continued solid execution providing for both sequential revenue and throughput growth, while readying ourselves for the production ramp at our German plant", said Mike Ahearn, Chief Executive Officer of First Solar.
