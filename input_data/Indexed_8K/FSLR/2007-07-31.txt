Table of Contents
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 99.1
 First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007. Quarterly revenues were $77.2 million, up from $66.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and up from $27.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006.
PHOENIX, AZ  July 31, 2007
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $44.4 million, or $0.58 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to net income of $5.0 million, or $0.07 per share on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and a net loss of $2.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 or $(0.03) per share on a fully diluted pro-forma basis. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 includes a one time income tax benefit of $39.2 million, or $0.51 per share on a fully diluted basis, resulting from the reversal of valuation allowances against previously established U.S. deferred income tax assets. The reversal was based upon the Company's assessment of the future realization of its U.S. deferred income tax assets.
Pro-forma earnings per share for the three months ended July 1, 2006 have been adjusted to give effect to the Company's equity offerings during 2006, including its initial public offering, as if each occurred on January 1, 2006. The Company believes the pro-forma earnings per share presentation represents a meaningful basis for the comparison of its current results to results during fiscal periods occurring prior to the Company's initial public offering.
On a GAAP fully diluted basis, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $0.58 per share, compared to $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Net loss for the second quarter of 2006 was $(0.05) per share on a GAAP fully diluted basis.
