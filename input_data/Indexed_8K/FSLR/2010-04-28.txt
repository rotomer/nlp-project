Exhibit 99.1
 
 First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 27, 2010. Quarterly net sales were $568.0 million, up 36% from $418.2 million in the first quarter of 2009, mainly due to strong PV module demand and increased production, partially offset by a decline in pricing.  First quarter 2010 net sales declined $73.3 million from the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to a shift from turnkey system sales to module sales.
Tempe, Ariz.   April 28, 2010
The first quarter 2010 net income was $172.3 million or $2.00 per fully diluted share, up from the prior year of $164.6 million or $1.99 per fully diluted share, which included a $0.14 per share one-time tax benefit related to our Malaysian tax holiday. Net income for the first quarter was up from $141.6 million or $1.65 per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter 2009 because of higher volumes, increased module prices and the absence of certain non-recurring expenses.
The First Solar Board of Directors has approved an additional four line manufacturing plant with an annual capacity of over 220 MW at the first quarter 2010 line run-rate. The plant is expected to begin production in the fourth quarter of 2011.
For 2010, First Solar forecasts net sales of $2.6 to $2.7 billion, reflecting reallocation of module capacity from our systems business to meet stronger module demand by our European customers. Earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $6.80 to $7.30, and include $0.09-0.10 per share dilution for the pending acquisition of NextLight Renewable Power, LLC. Total capital spending is projected to be $625 to $650 million.  The company expects to generate $725 to $775 million of operating cash flow. First Solar has posted its First Quarter Earnings Call Presentation, which includes guidance for fiscal 2010 and additional details regarding the key assumptions relating to this guidance, in the Investor section of its websi te at www.firstsolar.com.
