ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On October 15, 2010, First Solar, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a $600,000,000 revolving credit facility pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of October 15, 2010 (the "Closing Date"), among the Company, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH (the "Subsidiary Borrower"), the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"), Bank of America, N.A. and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, as Documentation Agents (the "Documentation Agents"), and Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch, as Syndication Agent (the "Syndication Agent"), which amends and restates the credit agreement dated as of September 4, 2009 (the "Original Credit Agreement"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Borrower, the lenders party thereto, the Administrative Agent, the Documentation Agents and the Syndication Agent. (On September 10, 2009, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission describing the Original Credit Agreement, and the related guarantee and collateral agreement and foreign security agreements, and attaching the same as exhibits thereto.) A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Credit Agreement provides the Company, the Subsidiary Borrower (and other subsidiaries of the Company who may in the future be designated as borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement) with a senior secured five-year revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $600,000,000, which is available for letters of credit and a portion of which is also available for swingline loans. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available for general corporate purposes. References to the Company below include the Subsidiary Borrower and any additional borrowers under the Credit Agreement, where the context so requires. Subject to certain conditions, the Company has the right to increase the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility up to $750,000,000.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus (a) a eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the rate (adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities) for eurocurrency deposits for a period of one, two, three or six months, as selected by the Company appearing on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (3) a eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the rate (adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities) for eurocurrency deposits for a period of one month appearing on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page plus 1.0%. The interest rate with respect to the revolving loans is a percentage per annum equal to (1) the base rate plus 1.25% for base rate loans or (2) the eurocurrency rate plus 2.25% for eurocurrency rate loans, subject to adjustment based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio from time to time.
In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the Lenders in respect of the average daily unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee rate is 0.375% per annum, subject to adjustment based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio from time to time. The Company will also pay a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency revolving loans on the face amount of each letter of credit and a fronting fee in an amount agreed by the Company and such issuing lender, in addition to customary letter of credit fees, unless otherwise specifically agreed with such issuing lender.
The Company may designate additional borrowing subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement subject to providing notice and certain documentation to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent's consultation with all the Lenders that such designation does not cause any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage to the Lenders.
The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement at any time without premium or penalty, subject to customary "breakage" costs with respect to eurocurrency loans and certain other requirements. The Company is required to prepay loans or cash collateralize letters of credit upon notice from the Administrative Agent that, as of any date of calculation by the Administrative Agent, the aggregate amount of revolving extensions of credit exceeds 105% of the total revolving commitments of the Lenders, in such amounts such that, after giving effect to such mandatory prepayment, such excess shall be eliminated.
 
The loans made to the Company are (i) secured by the following share pledges: (a) a pledge by the Company of 66% of the capital stock of First Solar FE Holdings Pte Ltd. (Singapore), (b) a pledge by the Company of 66% of the capital stock of First Solar Holdings GmbH (Germany) and (c) a pledge by the Company of 66% of the capital stock of First Solar France Holdings SAS, and (ii) secured by a security interest in intercompany receivables advanced to the Company or any of its subsidiaries (but, in the case such right to payment is owing by an Unrestricted Subsidiary (as defined in the Credit Agreement), only if it arises out of the sale of solar modules).
The loans made to the Subsidiary Borrower are (i) guaranteed by the Company, (ii) guaranteed by certain of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries organized under the laws of Germany, (iii) secured by the following share pledges: (a) a pledge by First Solar Holdings GmbH of all of the capital stock of First Solar GmbH, (b) a pledge by First Solar Holdings GmbH of all of the capital stock of First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, and (c) a pledge by the Company of 34% of the capital stock of First Solar Holdings GmbH, (iv) secured by a security interest in intercompany receivables held by First Solar Holdings GmbH, First Solar GmbH, and First Solar Manufacturing GmbH (subject to certain exceptions) and (v) subject to a security trust agreement, setting forth additional terms regarding the foregoing Germany security documents and arrangements.
The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, (i) the ability of the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Credit Agreement, refers to First Solar FE Holdings Pte Ltd., First Solar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd., First Solar Holdings GmbH, First Solar GmbH, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH, First Solar France Holdings SAS and First Solar France Manufacturing SAS as of the Closing Date) to incur additional indebtedness or guarantee obligations and (ii) the Company's ability to: (a) create liens on assets, (b) engage in mergers or consolidations, (c) dispose of certain property, (d) pay dividends and distributions, (e) make certain acquisitions, (f) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, (g) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (h) enter into certain swap agreements, (i) change its fiscal periods, (j) enter into certain negative pledge arrangements, (k) enter into agreements that restrict distributions from subsidiaries and (l) change the Company's lines of business.
In addition, the Credit Agreement includes financial covenants requiring the Company to not exceed a maximum leverage ratio, to generate a minimum amount of EBITDA and to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity. The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default.
The foregoing summary of the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated into this report by reference.

(a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to (i) ABR Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate and (ii) interest and fees payable hereunder denominated in British Pound Sterling, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Company and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a Eurocurrency Rate, or of a rate for an amount owing in a currency other than Dollars. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Company and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
Computation of Interest and Fees
(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Company, deliver to the Company a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.12(a).
2.14 . If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:
Inability to Determine Interest Rate
(a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period, or
(b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurocurrency Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,
 
the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Company and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given and until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent any request by the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) for a Eurocurrency Loan of the affected type or in the affected currency, or a conversion to or continuation of a Eurocurrency Loan of the affected type or if the affected currency, pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.10(b), shall be deemed rescinded; that in the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one currency, then Eurocurrency Loans in the other currency shall be permitted.
provided
2.15 . (a) Each borrowing by a Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders shall be made according to the respective Revolving Percentages of the relevant Lenders.
Pro Rata Treatment and Payments
pro
rata
(b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by a Borrower on account of principal of and interest on its Revolving Loans shall be made according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such Revolving Loans then held by the Lenders.
pro
rata
(c) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by a Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 1:00 P.M., Local Time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the relevant Funding Office, in Dollars (with respect to Obligations denominated in Dollars), Canadian Dollars (with respect to Obligations denominated in Canadian Dollars), British Pound Sterling (with respect to Obligations denominated in British Pound Sterling) and Euro (with respect to Obligations denominated in Euro), and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to each relevant Lender promptly upon receipt in like funds as received, net of any amounts owing by such Lender pursuant to Section 9.7. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurocurrency Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurocurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to (i) in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, the greater of (x) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent or (ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Euro at the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in Euro. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to (i) in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, ABR Loans or (ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Euro at the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds in Euro plus the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Loans, on demand, from the applicable Borrower.
 
(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the applicable Borrower hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the applicable Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of amounts denominated in Dollars, the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) in the case of amounts denominated in Euro, at the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short term funds in Euro. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the applicable Borrower.

rata
(f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.5(b), 2.5(c), 2.15(e) or 3.4(a), unless subject to a good faith dispute, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Lender hereunder for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
2.16 . (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:
Requirements of Law
(i) shall subject any Lender or the Issuing Lender to any (or any increase in any) Other Connection Taxes with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any Letter of Credit, or any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Loan made or Letter of Credit issued by it, except any such Taxes imposed on or measured by its net income or profits (however denominated) or franchise taxes imposed in lieu of net income or profits taxes;
(ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate; or
(iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition (other than with respect to Taxes);
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans (or, in the case of clause (i), any Loan, any Letter of Credit, or any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Loan made or Letter of Credit issued by it) or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the applicable Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, promptly following its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable; that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith shall be deemed to be a change in a Requirement of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
provided
(b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
(c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the applicable Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the Company pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
provided
2.17 . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document or Letter of Credit shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes unless such withholding is required by any Requirement of Law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it (or in the case of any Lender that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, by such Lender for the account of any of its direct or indirect beneficial owners) is so required to deduct and withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent (or such Lender, if applicable) may so deduct and withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required withholdings or deductions (including withholdings or deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender, any Issuing Lender or its beneficial owner, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholdings or deductions been made.
Taxes
(b) Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Lender, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable by the Administrative Agent, such Lender (or its beneficial owner) or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) Within 10 days after demand therefor, each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (or any Loan Party) for the full amount of any Taxes (or in the case of a Loan Party, any Excluded Taxes) attributable to such Lender that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party (provided that, with respect to the Administrative Agent, only to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority and together with reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent or the Loan Parties, as applicable, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(f) [Reserved]
(g) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any applicable withholding Tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document or Letter of Credit shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent or, in the case of a Participant, to the Administrative Agent and the Lender from which the related Participation shall have been purchased), at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law (if any) as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, in the case of any withholding Tax other than the U.S. federal withholding Tax,the completion, execution and submission of such forms shall not be required if (1) in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender and (2) in the case of German withholding Tax, such forms are not substantially similar to forms prescribed by applicable law as of the date hereof for exemption from or reduction of German withholding Tax.
 
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower, each Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or, in the case of a Participant, to the Administrative Agent and the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(iii) In addition to the foregoing, if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, FATCA shall include any amendments thereto and any regulations or official interpretations thereof.
(iv) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(h) If the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including additional amounts paid by any Loan Party pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes with respect to such refund) of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to the receipt of such refund), that such indemnifying party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.17(h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will any Issuing Lender or Lender be required to pay any amount to any Loan Party the payment of which would place the Issuing Lender or such Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Issuing Lender or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
provided
(i) The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
2.18 . Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by such Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans after the Company has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by such Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurocurrency Loans after the Company has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans, or a conversion of Eurocurrency Loans into Eurocurrency Loans with a different Interest Period, on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurocurrency market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted to the Company by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
Indemnity

2.19 . Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.16 or 2.17(a) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Company, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; , that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and , , that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of any Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a). Each Lender may at any time and for any period, by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company, designate another lending office (including an Affiliate of a Lender) for any Loans so long as such designation would not give rise to any additional obligation on the part of any Borrower under Section 2.16 or 2.17(a).
Change of Lending Office

2.20 . The Company shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a), (b) is a Defaulting Lender, or (c) does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of each of the Lenders or each of the Lenders affected thereby and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent, with a replacement financial institution; that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.19 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a), (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) each applicable Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.18 if any Eurocurrency Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the replaced Lender shall be deemed to have consented to an Assignment and Acceptance and shall not be required to execute an Assignment and Acceptance), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17(a), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.
Replacement of Lenders
provided
 
2.21 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders.
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.6;
(b) the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Extensions of Credit of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder, provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender, and any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of any affected Lender or all affected Lenders or such Lender shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender that is an affected Lender or such Lender;
(c) if any Swingline Loans or L/C Obligations exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) all or any part of such Swingline Loans and L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Percentages but only to the extent that (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Extensions of Credit does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied at such time; and
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the applicable Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the Swingline Loans and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8 for so long as such L/C Obligations are outstanding, unless the Swingline Lender or the applicable Issuing Lender, as applicable, have agreed on an alternate arrangement;
(iii) if the applicable Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations pursuant to Section 2.21(c), such Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations during the period of such collateralization;
(iv) if the Revolving Percentages of the L/C Obligations of the non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to Section 2.21(c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be correspondingly adjusted for the benefit of such non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Percentages; or
(v) if any Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to Section 2.21(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the applicable Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder, all fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 3.3 with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Lender until such Revolving Percentage of the L/C Obligations is cash collateralized and/or reallocated;
 
(d) so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Lenders shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 2.21(c), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.21(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein);
(e) if no Swingline Loans or L/C Obligations then exist, or all the obligations of the Defaulting Lender in respect of the outstanding Swingline Loans or L/C Obligations have been reallocated, cash collateralized or prepaid as contemplated in paragraph (c)(i) or (ii) of this Section 2.21, the Company shall have the right, notwithstanding Section 2.15, to terminate the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender only upon not less than three Business Days prior notice to the Administrative Agent and payment in full on the date of such termination to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Defaulting Lender, of the principal and accrued interest and fees then owing to such Defaulting Lender, with the Company remaining liable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.18 if such payment is made in respect of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto; and
(f) any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder on account of any fees shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated account and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, pro rata, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lenders or Swingline Lender hereunder, (iii) third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by an Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender in respect of any existing or future participating interest in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit, (iv) fourth, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent, (v) fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, held in such account as cash collateral for future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender in respect of any Loans under this Agreement, and (vi) sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, the Issuing Lenders and the Swingline Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Revolving Percentages of the non-Defaulting Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Revolving Percentage.
 
2.22 The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary that is (i) a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) a Manufacturing Subsidiary, as a Borrowing Subsidiary upon ten Business Days notice, or shorter notice if acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (such notice to include the name, primary business address and tax identification number of such proposed Borrowing Subsidiary). Upon proper notice and receipt by the Administrative Agent of such documents and legal opinions as the Administrative Agent in consultation with all the Lenders may reasonably request (including a legal opinion that no withholding Tax is applicable with respect to any payment made by such Restricted Subsidiary and, with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Foreign Subsidiary, any documents contemplated to be delivered by such Restricted Subsidiary (and its Restricted Subsidiaries and parent entities) pursuant to 6.9(c) were such Restricted Subsidiary a new Foreign Subsidiary acquired on the date of designation of such new Borrowing Subsidiary) and subject to the Administrative Agent's determining in consultation with all the Lenders that designating such Restricted Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary would not cause any Lender to suffer any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage (it being understood and agreed that no Lender shall be deemed to suffer any such disadvantage on account of any withholding Tax being applicable to any payment made by such Restricted Subsidiary to the extent that the applicable Loan Parties agree to treat any such withholding Tax as an Indemnified Tax, in which case no legal opinion that no withholding Tax is applicable shall be required), such Restricted Subsidiary shall be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. A Restricted Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder at such time the Company gives at least ten Business Days prior notice (or, shorter notice if acceptable to the Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of its intention of terminating such Restricted Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary, that any such termination shall not be effective and such Restricted Subsidiary shall remain a Borrowing Subsidiary until such time as Loans to such Borrowing Subsidiary and accrued interest thereon and all other amounts then due from such Borrowing Subsidiary have been paid in full. In this connection, if outstanding Letters of Credit have been issued for the account of a Borrowing Subsidiary but all its Loans and accrued interest thereon have been paid in full, the Company shall be permitted to reallocate such Letters of Credit to another Borrower for the purpose of terminating such Borrowing Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary, that such reallocation would not cause the applicable Issuing Lender to suffer any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage and such reallocation is documented in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender.

Each L/C Participant agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the applicable Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed. Each L/C Participant's obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant may have against such Issuing Lender, the applicable Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the applicable Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L/C Participant or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to such Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Loans. A certificate of such Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
(c) Whenever, at any time after an Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its share thereof; , , that in the event that any such payment received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing Lender to it.

Each Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by each Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding on such Borrower and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Lenders to such Borrower.
