First Solar, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2010 Financial Results
 
Tempe, Arizona - October 28, 2010
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 25, 2010. Third quarter 2010 net sales were $797.9 million, an increase of $210.0 million from the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to increased system sales (driven principally by the sale of the 60 megawatt (AC) Sarnia Phase 2 project in Canada), partially offset by a decline in our module average selling prices and lower blended euro exchange rates. Quarterly net sales grew 66% from $480.9 million in the third quarter of 2009, due to increased systems revenue and module production volumes, partially offset by a decline in our module average selling prices and lower blended euro exchange rates.
 
Third quarter net income per fully diluted share was $2.04, up from $1.84 in the second quarter of 2010 and up from $1.79 in the third quarter of 2009. The third quarter net income includes a one-time tax expense of $14.7 million, or $0.17 per fully diluted share, relating to the Company's decision to repatriate $300 million of earnings from certain of its foreign subsidiaries. Quarter over quarter, the net income increase was primarily driven by higher net sales partially offset by the one-time tax expense. Year over year, the net income increase was primarily driven by higher module production, lower module cost per wa tt and increased system sales, partially offset by reduced module average selling prices and the above one-time tax expense.
 
We continue to execute on our growth strategy and to develop sustainable markets for solar electricity, said Rob Gillette, CEO of First Solar. Our investment in research and development combined with plans to nearly double our manufacturing capacity will help us meet robust customer demand while continuing to drive down the cost of solar power.
