First Solar, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2010 Financial Results
 
Tempe, Arizona - February 24, 2011
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. Fourth quarter 2010 net sales were $610 million, a decrease of $188 million from the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to the timing of system sales and the December implementation of 2011 pricing, partially offset by an increase in volume. Quarterly net sales decreased slightly from $641 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, due to decreased systems revenue and reduced module prices, partially offset by higher volume. Net sales for the fiscal year 2010 were $2,564 million, up 24% from $2,066 million in fiscal year 2009.
 
Fourth quarter net income per fully diluted share was $1.80, down from $2.04 in the third quarter of 2010 and up from $1.65 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Quarter over quarter, the net income decrease was primarily driven by lower net sales and increased expenses, partially offset by higher gross margins. Year over year, the net income increase was primarily driven by higher module production and lower module cost per watt, partially offset by reduced module average selling prices and increased expenses. Fiscal 2010 net income per fully diluted share was $7.68, up from $7.53 in fiscal 2009.
 
First Solar achieved several milestones in 2010:
 
In the fourth quarter the operations team executed well, and we sold 400 MW of projects in North America, positioning us to achieve our 2011 growth goals, said Rob Gillette, CEO of First Solar. We have good demand visibility in 2011 and a broader geographic reach, which gives us confidence in our ability to sell the 2 GW that we plan to produce.
 
For 2011, First Solar is updating guidance as follows:
  
First Solar will discuss these results and the outlook for 2011 in a conference call scheduled for today at 4:30 p.m. EST. Investors may access a live audio webcast of this conference call and the earnings call presentation, which includes
