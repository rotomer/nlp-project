On May 18, 2011, First Solar Manufacturing GmbH (the "Borrower"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of First Solar, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a EUR 124,500,000 Credit Facility Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrower, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, as arranger (the "Arranger"), Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Luxembourg Branch, as facility agent (the "Facility Agent"), Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Luxembourg Branch, as security agent (the "Security Agent"), and the additional finance parties party thereto. A copy of the Credit Agreement (translated into English from the German original) is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Concurrently with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a Guarantee Agreement dated as of May 18, 2011 (the "Guarantee Agreement"), among the Company, the Borrower and the Security Agent. A copy of the Guarantee Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The proceeds of the Credit Agreement will be used by the Borrower to, among other things, finance and/or refinance the acquisition of certain land parcels located in Frankfurt/Oder, Germany and the construction of a new facility for the production of thin-film solar modules (the "FFO2 Production Facility").
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 1.35% (the "Margin") plus mandatory costs plus a euribor rate determined by reference to the rate for the offering of deposits in euro appearing on the Reuters screen (EURIBOR01) for the interest period selected by the Borrower. During the period from the date of the Credit Agreement until the date 17 months thereafter, unutilized commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to a commitment fee equal to 35% of the Margin.
The Borrower may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement at any time without premium or penalty, subject to compensation for customary "break costs" and certain other requirements. The Borrower is required to prepay loans with certain asset sales and insurance proceeds and may be required by the lenders to prepay the loans upon the occurrence of a change of control.
The loans made to the Borrower are (i) secured by, among other things, a first-ranking abstract land charge over the parcels of land on which the FFO2 Production Facility will be constructed and a pledge of a debt service reserve account and (ii) guaranteed by the Company pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement and by the German Federal Government and the Federal State of Brandenburg.
The Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Borrower to incur indebtedness, create liens, effect asset sales, make dividends, other distributions and share buybacks, engage in reorganizations, make acquisitions and create joint ventures and make loans. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes financial covenants relating to minimum liquidity, maximum permitted leverage ratio and minimum EBITDA. The Credit Agreement also contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default.
The foregoing summary of the Credit Agreement, the guarantee and security documents described herein, and the transactions contemplated thereby, does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of each of the documents described herein.
The information included in Item 1.01 above is incorporated by reference to this Item 2.03.

On the immediately following 1 April and 1 October of each given year, 0.5% of the highest guaranty amount relating to the principal must be paid for each half-year period commencing on those dates.
III. Guaranty fee
The Borrower must pay a guaranty fee for the guaranties from the time that the guaranty instrument or deed is issued and for the period of the guaranty's term. For parallel state guaranties, the guaranty fee will generally be 0.5% of the guaranty amount that exists or that has been approved as of those dates and such fee will be due on or before 1 April and 1 October of each year (half-year fee period), unless European rules require the imposition of higher fees. In certain groups of cases (, companies facing difficulties), the guarantor reserves the right to stipulate higher fees.
inter alia
Different European rules could apply specifically with respect to guaranties that are granted on the basis of so-called "" (Guarantee scheme under Temporary Framework), "" (Federal Framework  limited amounts of comparable aid) as well as the "" (Framework of aid) as well as the General Block Exemption Regulation. The guaranty fees in those cases are based on the relevant EU Commission "safe-harbour premiums" that are stipulated in the relevant rules or frameworks or under the approved methods for calculating the value of aid in N 197/2007, N 541/2007 and N 762/2007.

plus
If, as part of the agreement, the guaranteed loan is divided and securitised into several tranches relating to different half-year fee periods, then upon a well-founded request, tranche-based fee arrangements may be established on a case-by-case basis. The Federal government and the relevant Federal State would thereupon reserve the right to charge a processing or administrative fee in accordance with the application fee rules, in the event that there are significant changes to a guaranty that had been previously approved but not yet securitized.
With respect to the guaranties issued by the Federal government and by the Federal States of North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony Anhalt and Thuringia, the application fee as well as the administrative or processing fee for significant changes to a guaranty, which had been previously approved but not yet securitized, and the ongoing fees must be paid by wire transfer to PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Dsseldorf, and specifically to its escrow account under the name "Federal Ministry of Finance", account number 3 015 112, which is held at WestLB AG, Dsseldorf (bank routing code 300 500 00) and the transfer order must include the guaranty number. For guaranties issued by other Federal States, for which PricewaterhouseCoopers AG does not act as mandatary, the fees owed must be remitted to the relevant mandatary or to the accounts designated by the Federal States. Under the parallel state guaranties, the foregoing rules regarding the ongoing fees will apply uniformly to the guaranties issued by the Federal government and to the state guarantees of all Federal States5.

garantiert
selbstndiges Zahlungsversprechen

Garantie auf erstes Anfordern
For the further avoidance of doubt, the Guarantor shall have no remaining obligations under this Agreement after the obligations secured by it have been fully and permanently discharged.
No Financing Party will be required to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from the Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement. This applies irrespective of any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.
 
The obligations of the Guarantor contained herein shall be in addition to and independent of every other Security or guarantee which any Financing Party may at any time hold in respect of any Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents.

Any settlement or discharge between the Guarantor and any Financing Party shall be conditional upon no Security or payment to such Financing Party by the Guarantor or any other entity on behalf of the Guarantor being avoided or reduced by virtue of any laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or similar laws of general application and, if any such Security or payment is so avoided or reduced, each Financing Party shall be entitled to recover the value or amount of such Security or payment from the Guarantor subsequently as if such settlement or discharge had not occurred.
Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Guarantor hereby confirms that if the Borrower and any Financing Party enter into any agreement or other arrangement, including (without limitation) any amendment or supplement to or restatement of any Finance Documents, howsoever fundamental, then the Borrower's execution of any such agreement or other arrangement, whether or not expressly made or purportedly made on behalf of the Guarantor, shall bind the Guarantor and the guarantee contained in this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect without the need to obtain any confirmation or acknowledgement from the Guarantor that its guarantee continues in full force and effect and applies to the Guarantor's liabilities under the Finance Documents as amended, supplemented or restated in accordance with the agreement of the Borrower.

The rights and remedies provided hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
