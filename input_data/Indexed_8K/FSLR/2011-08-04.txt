First Solar Announces Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results
TEMPE, Ariz. - Aug. 4, 2011
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2011. Net sales were $533 million in the quarter, a decrease of $34.5 million from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower average selling prices (ASPs) as solar photovoltaic (PV) policy uncertainties in Italy, Germany and France adversely impacted demand in the second quarter. Quarterly net sales decreased from $588 million in the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower ASPs and a decrease in revenue recognized by the systems business, partially offset by higher module volume.
Second quarter net income per fully diluted share was $0.70, down from $1.33 in the first quarter of 2011 and $1.84 in the second quarter of 2010. Quarter over quarter, the net income decrease was primarily driven by lower ASPs and a higher tax rate, partially offset by higher volume sold. Year over year, the net income decrease was principally driven by lower ASPs and increased investment in the Utilities Systems Business and research and development.
First Solar continued to execute in the quarter despite a challenging European market, and our 2011 outlook remains solid due to our differentiated and resilient business model, said Rob Gillette, CEO of First Solar. We expect stronger performance in the second half of 2011 as we build projects from our systems pipeline, develop promising new markets, execute our cost reduction roadmaps and continue to improve module efficiencies.
First Solar's updated 2011 guidance is as follows:
