Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 30, 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) finalized a federal loan and loan guarantee of up to $646 million to support project financing for the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One (AVSR) project, a 230-megawatt solar photovoltaic project in northern Los Angeles County, California, which First Solar, Inc. (First Solar) developed, sold to Exelon Corporation and will build, operate and maintain. Construction of AVSR has been proceeding; however, initial funding of the DOE loan for AVSR has not yet occurred pending resolution of an outstanding construction permit issue. As described in the September 30, 2011 Form 8-K, advances under the loan are contingent on the satisfaction of certain conditions and the parties agreed that First Solar would repurchase AVSR if initial funding of the loan did not occur within approximately four months. Because all conditions have not yet been satisfied, the parties have agreed to extend the timeframe for initial funding of the loan to February 24, 2012. If initial funding of the loan has not occurred by such date and such date is not extended further, First Solar would repurchase AVSR for an amount equal to the purchase price paid by Exelon for the project, approximately $75 million, plus certain other costs incurred by Exelon related to the project. If First Solar were to repurchase AVSR, the reacquired project would then become available for sale by First Solar to another party. First Solar expects its current cash and other capital resources would be sufficient to enable First Solar to repurchase AVSR, if necessary, while meeting First Solar's working capital and capital expenditure needs. First Solar expects to begin recognizing revenue for AVSR following initial funding of the loan.
