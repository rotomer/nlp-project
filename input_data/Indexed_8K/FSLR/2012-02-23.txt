As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) on September 30, 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) finalized a federal loan and loan guarantee of up to $646 million to support project financing for the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One (AVSR) project, a 230-megawatt solar photovoltaic project in northern Los Angeles County, California, which First Solar, Inc. (First Solar) developed, sold to Exelon Corporation (Exelon) and will build, operate and maintain. As previously reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on February 9, 2012 (the February 9, 2012 Form 8-K), Exelon and First Solar had agreed to extend the timeframe for initial funding of the DOE loan for AVSR to February 24, 2012.
Changes to the construction permit for AVSR referenced in the February 9, 2012 Form 8-K have been approved by the governmental body that issued the permit. Exelon and First Solar have agreed to extend their deadline for initial funding of the DOE loan for AVSR to April 6, 2012 to allow sufficient time for the initial funding to occur. The DOE had previously extended to April 6, 2012 the date by which the initial funding must occur. Construction of AVSR has been proceeding.
