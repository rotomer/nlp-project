EXHIBIT 99.1
First Solar, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter and 2011 Financial Results
 
TEMPE, Ariz. - Feb. 28, 2012
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2011. Fourth quarter 2011 net sales were $660 million, a decrease of $345 million from the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to the timing of revenue recognition in our systems business and lower volume for module-only sales. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2010, quarterly net sales increased $50 million from $610 million. Net sales for 2011 were $2.8 billion, up about 8% from fiscal year 2010.
Fourth quarter net loss per fully diluted share was $4.78, compared to a net income per fully diluted share of $2.25 in the third quarter of 2011 and $1.80 in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter of 2011 was impacted by pre-tax charges of $393 million (reducing EPS by $3.90) associated with a non-cash goodwill impairment for our components business, $164 million (reducing EPS by $1.67) related to warranty and cost in excess of normal warranty expense, and $60 million (reducing EPS by $0.43) related to restructuring activities, as announced in December 2011. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP net income per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter 2011 was $1.26. Net loss per share in 2011 was $0.46, compared to a net income per fully diluted share of $7.68 in 2010. Excluding the fourth-quarter 2011 charges listed above as well as $46.9 million of warranty and cost in excess of normal warranty expensed earlier this year, non-GAAP net income per fully diluted share was $6.01 for 2011. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), please see tables below.
 
Cash and Marketable Securities at the end of the fourth quarter were $788 million, down slightly from $795 million at the end of the third quarter.
First Solar achieved several milestones in 2011:
1
First Solar's performance in the quarter was impacted by an aggressive competitive environment, an uncertain regulatory environment, warranty-related charges, and restructuring costs incurred to help position our business for the future, said Mike Ahearn, Chairman and interim Chief Executive Officer of First Solar. Despite these headwinds, we continue to make strides reducing manufacturing costs, increasing module efficiency, and successfully building out our captive project pipeline. These improvements, combined with our recent restructuring and strategic repositioning, enhance our competitive position in a very challenging environment.
First Solar is updating 2012 guidance as follows:
First Solar has scheduled a conference call at 4:30 p.m. EST on February 28, 2012 to discuss the fourth quarter results and updated 2012 guidance. Investors may access a live webcast of this conference call by visiting

The non-GAAP financial measures included in the tables below are non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, which adjust for the following items:  Warranty and Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense, Goodwill Impairment and Restructuring.  We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operating performance.  Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's performance to prior periods and investors benefit from an understanding of these non-GAAP financial measures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from or as an alternative to measures presented in accordance with GAAP such as net (loss) income and net (loss) income per share.
Warranty and Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense:
Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses, warranty and cost in excess of normal warranty expense primarily reflect estimated costs related to our remediation of a manufacturing excursion that occurred between June 2008 and June 2009. We exclude this expense from our non-GAAP measures because we do not believe they reflect expected future costs.
Goodwill Impairment:
Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, goodwill impairment primarily represents a write-down of most of the goodwill we booked from our acquisitions of OptiSolar in 2009 and NextLight in 2010. We exclude the impairment of goodwill from our non-GAAP measures because it does not reflect future performance, does not affect our cash position, and does not affect our cash flows from operating activities.
Restructuring:
Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, restructuring costs represent asset impairment and related costs due to certain research and development activities we are no longer pursuing outside of our core technology, as well as severance for headcount reductions. We exclude restructuring from our non-GAAP measures because the impairment portion of the charges does not reflect our cash position or our cash flows from operating activities, and the restructuring charges overall do not reflect future operating expenses, are not indicative of our core operating performance, and are not meaningful in comparing to our past operating performance.
