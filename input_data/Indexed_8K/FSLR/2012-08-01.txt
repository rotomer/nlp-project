EXHIBIT 99.1
First Solar, Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results
Net sales of $957 million
GAAP EPS of $1.27 per fully diluted share including charges of $0.39 per share
Raises 2012 EPS guidance to $4.20 to $4.70 per share
 
TEMPE, Ariz. - Aug. 1, 2012
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2012. Net sales were $957 million in the quarter, an increase of $460 million from the first quarter of 2012 and $425 million from the second quarter of 2011.  The increases were primarily due to an increase in the number and size of projects under construction meeting revenue recognition criteria during the quarter, including Antelope Valley Solar Ranch 1 in California and Silver State North in Nevada.
 
The Company reported second quarter net income of $1.27 per fully diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.20 per fully diluted share in the first quarter of 2012 and net income of $0.70 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2011. The second quarter of 2012 was impacted by pre-tax charges of $36 million (reducing EPS by $0.39), relating to restructuring and certain costs in excess of normal warranty.
 
Cash and Marketable Securities at the end of the second quarter were $744 million, down from $750 million at the end of the first quarter of 2012.
Based on reductions in First Solars ongoing cost structure primarily related to our restructuring initiatives, the Company is increasing 2012 guidance as follows:
Despite market uncertainties, First Solar delivered strong performance in the quarter, said Jim Hughes, CEO. Looking forward, we are confident we have the right long-term strategy and the right platform to enable long-term growth and value creation. We believe that by executing our strategic roadmaps and completing our restructuring program we can achieve our targets of 2.6 to 3.0 GW of sales in sustainable markets, earning a return on invested capital of 13 to 17 percent by 2016.
For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), see the tables below.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures included in the tables below are non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, which adjust for the following items:  Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense, and Restructuring.  We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Companys operating performance.  Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Companys performance to prior periods and investors benefit from an understanding of these non-GAAP financial measures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from or as an alternative to measures presented in accordance with GAAP such as net income and net income per share.
Cost in Excess of Normal Warranty Expense:
Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of sales, cost in excess of normal warranty expense reflects estimated costs related to our remediation of a manufacturing excursion that occurred between June 2008 and June 2009. We exclude this expense from our non-GAAP measures because we do not believe they reflect expected long-term future costs.
 
Restructuring:
Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, restructuring costs represent asset impairment and related costs and severance and termination related costs primarily due to a series of restructuring initiatives intended to align the organization with our long-term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities and to reduce costs. We exclude restructuring from our non-GAAP measures because the asset impairment portion of the charges does not reflect our cash position or our cash flows from operating activities, and the restructuring charges overall do not reflect future operating expenses, are not indicative of our core operating performance, and are not meaningful in comparing to our past operating performance.
