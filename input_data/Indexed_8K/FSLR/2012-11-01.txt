EXHIBIT 99.1
First Solar, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results
Net sales of $839 million
GAAP EPS of $1.00 per fully diluted share including restructuring charges of $0.27 per share
Non-GAAP EPS per fully diluted share of $1.27, excluding restructuring charges
Tightens 2012 EPS guidance range to $4.40 to $4.70, increasing guidance mid-point to $4.55
TEMPE, Ariz., Nov. 1, 2012
- First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2012. Net sales were $839 million in the quarter, a decrease of $118 million from the second quarter of 2012 and $167 million from the third quarter of 2011.  The decrease in net sales from the second quarter of 2012 was primarily due to project-specific decreases including Silver State North, which was completed in the second quarter, and reduced construction activity at Agua Caliente, consistent with the Companys planned construction schedule. The decrease was partially offset by initial revenue recognition for the 550-megawatt
ac
Topaz Solar Farms project, which began construction in late 2011. 
The Company reported third quarter net income of $1.00 per fully diluted share, compared to net income of $1.27 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2012 and net income of $2.25 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of 2011. The third quarter of 2012 was impacted by pre-tax charges of $24.2 million (reducing EPS by $0.27), relating to previously announced restructuring actions.
Cash and Marketable Securities at the end of the third quarter were $717 million, down slightly from $744 million at the end of the second quarter of 2012.
The Company also updated its 2012 guidance as follows:
Despite continued uncertainties and over-supply conditions in the market, First Solar delivered another strong quarterly performance, said Jim Hughes, CEO. Our quarterly performance coupled with our recent project wins in sustainable markets demonstrates we are making meaningful progress in achieving our strategic plan for long-term growth and value creation.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures included in the table below are non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, which adjust for the following items: Restructuring.  We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Companys operating performance.  Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Companys performance to prior periods and investors benefit from an understanding of these non-GAAP financial measures. The use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from or as an alternative to measures presented in accordance with GAAP such as net income and net income per share.
 
Restructuring:
Included in our GAAP presentation of operating expenses, restructuring costs represent asset impairment and related costs and severance and termination related costs primarily due to a series of restructuring initiatives intended to align the organization with our long-term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities and to reduce costs. We exclude restructuring from our non-GAAP measures because the asset impairment portion of the charges does not reflect our cash position or our cash flows from operating activities, and the restructuring charges overall do not reflect future operating expenses, are not indicative of our core operating performance, and are not meaningful in comparing to our past operating performance.
