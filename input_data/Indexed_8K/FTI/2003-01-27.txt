EXHIBIT 99.1 News Release FMC Technologies Inc 200 East Randolph Drive Chicago, IL 60601 [Logo of FMC Technonogies] 1803 Gears Road Houston, TX 77067 For Release: Immediate Media Marvin Brown (281) 591-4212 Bruce Bullock (281) 591-4429 Investors Dave Grzebinski, CFA (312) 861-6414 FMC Technologies Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2002 Earnings Per Share of $0.37 and $0.96 Highlights: . Fourth quarter 2002 earnings per diluted share of $0.37, up 16 percent from fourth quarter 2001 results . Full year 2002 earnings per diluted share of $0.96, up 60 percent and 17 percent from GAAP and pro forma results a year ago . Strong free cash flow reduces net debt to $203 million, down from $231 million at the end of the third quarter . Backlog surges to a record high of $1.15 billion on strength of Energy Production Systems' inbound orders CHICAGO and HOUSTON, January 27, 2003 - FMC Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: FTI) today reported fourth quarter 2002 sales of $580 million and net income of $0.37 per diluted share, which was up 16 percent compared to the same period last year. Full year 2002 sales were $2.07 billion. Earnings, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, of $0.96 per diluted share are up 60 percent and up 17 percent, respectively, from 2001 GAAP earnings per share and income per share on a pro forma basis (see schedule below reconciling pro forma income per share to GAAP diluted EPS). "We are very pleased with our earnings and inbound results for the year, as we were able to meet our expectations despite very difficult market conditions," said Joseph H. Netherland, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our fourth quarter 2002 earnings of $0.37 per share reflected the continued strength in subsea systems, offset by the impact of difficult market conditions that affected many of our other businesses. "Weakness in the U.S. rig count impacted our surface completion and Weco(R)/Chiksan(R) businesses, while the soft U.S. economy discouraged capital investment by our FoodTech customers," Netherland continued. "The Halvorsen Loader program with the U.S. Air Force mitigated the adverse effects of reduced commercial airline capital expenditures that continue to affect our Airport Systems business. Based on current market and economic conditions, we expect earnings per share for full year 2003 to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.10." -more-
Page 2 - FMC Technologies Reports Fourth Quarter 2002 Results (a) In 2001, we recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges. The restructuring charges were related primarily to headcount reductions in response to adverse market conditions in certain businesses. See attached "Business Segment Data" for additional information. (b) In 2001, we recorded income tax charges related to repatriation of a portion of offshore earnings and the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of our separation from FMC Corporation. (c) Prior to June 1, 2001, our results were carved out from the consolidated financial statements of FMC Corporation. Pro forma interest expense represents an estimate of the additional interest expense prior to June 1, 2001, that we may have incurred had we been a stand-alone entity. Review of Operations - Fourth Quarter 2002 - ------------------------------------------ Sales for Energy Systems (comprising Energy Production Systems and Energy Processing Systems) were $384 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, up 14 percent from $337 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 and 13 percent from $340 million in the third quarter of 2002. Earnings for the current quarter were $27.6 million, down 6 percent from $29.2 million in the same period last year and up 55 percent from $17.8 million in the third quarter of 2002. Energy Production Systems' year-over-year fourth quarter sales and profits increased 25 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Sales and profits rose sequentially from the third quarter by 13 percent and 29 percent, respectively. Energy Production Systems' profits increased to a new record from a record fourth quarter a year ago due to strong subsea sales and the absence of goodwill amortization resulting from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142), partially offset by lower results in surface completion systems and floating production systems. Energy Processing Systems' fourth quarter sales were down 7 percent year-over-year, and profits decreased 18 percent. Weakness in the U.S. land drilling market severely impacted Weco(R)/Chiksan(R) sales and profits. This weakness was somewhat offset by profit improvements in blending and transfer systems, as well as the absence of goodwill amortization expense. Energy Systems' inbound orders were $553 million for the fourth quarter, up 60 percent from $345 million in the year-ago period. Sequentially, inbound orders were up 72 percent from $322 million in the third quarter of 2002. Energy Systems' total backlog at the end of the fourth quarter - more -
Page 3 - FMC Technologies Reports Fourth Quarter 2002 Results was $933 million, up 38 percent from $676 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2001 and up 22 percent from $763 million at the end of the third quarter of 2002. Energy Systems' solid inbound and backlog performance for the quarter was driven by strength in Energy Production Systems, which received a large order from Sonatrach as well as orders from subsea customers. Energy Production Systems' inbound orders were up 87 percent from the year ago period and over 100 percent sequentially. Energy Processing Systems' inbound order rate was essentially flat year-over-year and sequentially. FoodTech's fourth quarter 2002 sales of $132 million were down 8 percent from $144 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, and earnings of $14.4 million were essentially flat with the year ago period. Sales and profits of freezing systems and food processing equipment were weak in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by increased activity in Asia. Results were positively affected by cost reduction efforts and the absence of goodwill amortization expense. Airport Systems' fourth quarter 2002 sales of $66 million were down 3 percent from $68 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, and earnings of $5.6 million increased substantially from $0.4 million in the prior-year period. Lower sales were primarily attributable to reductions in capital expenditures by commercial airline customers. However, compared to a weak fourth quarter a year ago, earnings improved due to increased deliveries of Halvorsen loaders to the U.S. Air Force. Corporate expenses in the fourth quarter of 2002 were $6.5 million, down 32 percent from $9.6 million in the prior-year period. Other expense, net, of $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 was unfavorable compared to $2.3 million in the prior-year period. Other expense, net, increased largely due to foreign exchange impacts. Net interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2002 was $2.7 million, down from $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. Due to strong cash flow, debt less cash at the end of the fourth quarter of 2002 was $203 million, down from $231 million at the end of the third quarter of 2002. Depreciation and amortization (D&A) for the fourth quarter of 2002 was approximately $13.1 million, down from $14.9 million in the prior-year period. Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2002 were $19.8 million. Full Year 2002 Results - ---------------------- For the full year 2002, sales of $2.07 billion were up 7 percent from $1.93 billion in 2001, reflecting the continued strength in Energy Production Systems. Income, before the cumulative effect of an accounting change, was $64.1 million, compared to income on a pro forma basis of $54.0 million in 2001. Energy Systems' sales in 2002 of $1.33 billion were up 19 percent from $1.13 billion in 2001. Earnings of $77.5 million were up 8 percent from $71.9 million in 2001. For the full year 2002, Energy Production Systems' sales of $940 million were up 30 percent, and profits of $50.4 million were up 23 percent from 2001 levels, based primarily on the strength in subsea systems. Energy Processing Systems' 2002 sales and profits, respectively, were $396 million, down 1 percent, and $27.1 million, down 12 percent. Lower Energy Processing Systems' profits were a result of lower sales in the Weco(R)/Chiksan(R) product lines, partially offset by improved results in loading systems, as well as the benefit of the absence of goodwill amortization expense. - more -
Page 4 - FMC Technologies Reports Fourth Quarter 2002 Results Energy Systems' inbound orders for the full year 2002 of $1.59 billion were up 16 percent from the year-ago level. Energy Production Systems' year-over-year inbound order growth of 23 percent came from increased subsea systems orders, while Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were down 3 percent. Backlog for Energy Systems ended the year at $933 million, up 38 percent from year-end 2001. FoodTech's sales in 2002 of $497 million declined 3 percent from $513 million in 2001. Earnings in 2002 of $43.3 million improved 9 percent compared to $39.6 million in 2001. A decrease in amortization expense, together with cost cutting efforts, drove the profit improvement. Airport Systems' sales in 2002 of $245 million were down 18 percent from $300 million in 2001. Earnings for Airport Systems in 2002 were $15.8 million, declining 13 percent from $18.1 million in 2001. Decreased volumes of commercial airline equipment contributed to lower results, which were offset somewhat by significantly higher volumes of Halvorsen loaders delivered to the U.S. Air Force. In 2002, Airport Systems delivered 133 Halvorsen loaders, compared to 19 units delivered in 2001. Corporate expenses for the full year 2002 were $24.1 million, down 29 percent compared to $33.8 million in 2001. Other expense, net, for 2002 totaled $9.7 million compared to $4.4 million in 2001, largely due to foreign exchange impacts. Net interest expense was $12.5 million in 2002, compared to $17.4 million on a pro forma basis in 2001. D&A for 2002 was $48.6 million. Capital expenditures of $68.1 million for 2002 were at a high level similar to 2001 due to Energy Production Systems' spending. Summary - ------- FMC Technologies increased earnings in 2002, despite difficult market conditions that affected many of its businesses. Within Energy Systems, subsea systems sales were strong throughout the year due to the secular trend toward offshore deepwater development, while lower U.S. land-based exploration and production activity negatively impacted both the surface completion and Weco(R)/Chiksan(R) businesses. Economic activity in the United States was slow throughout 2002, which adversely affected the food processing and commercial airline industries. Economic conditions in the United States have not yet significantly improved and most commercial airlines are expected to experience difficulties for the foreseeable future; however, subsea energy activity is anticipated to continue to be strong. # # # FMC Technologies, Inc.
