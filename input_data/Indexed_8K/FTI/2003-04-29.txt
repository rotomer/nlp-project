FMC Technologies Reports Strong First Quarter 2003, Driven by Energy Production Systems
 
Highlights:
 
 
and  FMC Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: FTI) today reported first quarter 2003 sales of $500 million and net income of $0.14 per diluted share. First quarter 2003 earnings per share were up 75 percent from first quarter 2002 earnings per share before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
CHICAGO
HOUSTON, April 28, 2003
 
"We are pleased with the results of the first quarter of 2003, which reflect the continuing strength of our Energy Production Systems business," said Joseph H. Netherland, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our subsea systems business within Energy Production Systems continues to perform very well. Our land-based energy businesses within both Energy Production Systems and Energy Processing Systems experienced slightly improved activity in the latter part of the quarter. Energy Processing Systems' revenues increased year-over-year, although the segment's results were affected in part by costs related to a restructuring program.
 
 
"Despite the continuing weakness of the U.S. and European economies, FoodTech revenues increased slightly and profit improved 44 percent due to lower costs. The weak economy and the financial condition of the commercial airlines continue to affect Airport Systems' profitability. The continued strength in Energy Systems and improvements in FoodTech are overshadowing general economic and commercial airline industry weakness, consequently, we continue to expect earnings per share for full-year 2003 to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.10."
 
Review of Operations  First Quarter 2003
 
Sales for Energy Systems (comprising Energy Production Systems and Energy Processing Systems) were $360 million in the first quarter of 2003, up 28 percent from $281 million in the first quarter of 2002. Earnings for the current quarter were $17.5 million, up 26 percent from $13.9 million in the same period last year.
 
Energy Production Systems' first quarter sales of $265 million and profits of $16.1 million increased year-over-year 34 percent and 48 percent, respectively. Energy Production Systems' profits increased from the year-ago period due to strong subsea sales and improved margins, but were partially offset by lower profits from floating production systems. Sales declined sequentially from the fourth quarter 2002 by 3 percent and profits were flat.
 
Energy Processing Systems' first quarter sales were up 13 percent year-over-year, but profits decreased $1.6 million. Each business within the segment experienced improved sales, but employee severance costs, and to a lesser extent adjustments to contract reserves, reduced profits.
 
Energy Systems' inbound orders were $371 million in the first quarter, down slightly from $379 million in the year-ago period. Inbound orders were down sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2002, which included a large order from Sonatrach. Energy Systems' total backlog at the end of the first quarter was $944 million, up 22 percent from $774 million at the end of the first quarter of 2002 and up slightly from $933 million at the end of 2002. Energy Production Systems' inbound orders were down 3 percent from the year-ago period and down 38 percent sequentially from a strong fourth quarter 2002. Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were flat year-over-year and declined 14 percent sequentially due to seasonal factors.
 
 
FoodTech's first quarter 2003 sales of $95 million were up 4 percent from $92 million in the first quarter of 2002, and earnings of $6.2 million increased 44 percent compared to $4.3 million in the year-ago period. Sales of food processing equipment increased slightly and costs for the entire segment were lower.
 
Airport Systems' first quarter 2003 sales of $46 million were down 12 percent from $53 million in the first quarter of 2002, and earnings of $0.8 million decreased slightly from $1.0 million in the prior-year period. Lower sales and profits were primarily attributable to further reductions of capital expenditures by commercial airline customers for both ground support equipment and passenger boarding bridges. Increased sales and profits related to the Halvorsen loader program partially offset these declines.
 
Corporate expenses in the first quarter of 2003 of $6.1 million were up slightly from $5.7 million in the prior-year period. Other expense, net, of $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2003 increased slightly from $3.0 million in the prior-year period. Net interest expense in the first quarter of 2003 was $2.2 million, down from $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2002 due to strong cash flow and reduced interest rates. The Company generated $25 million of cash during the quarter, before the termination of certain sale-leaseback obligations of $36 million. Debt less cash at the end of the first quarter of 2003 was $214 million, up only $11 million from year-end 2002.
 
Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter of 2003 totaled $12.2 million, up slightly from $11.8 million in the prior-year period. Capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2003 were $14.0 million, excluding equipment reacquired as a result of the termination of certain sale-leaseback obligations.
 
Summary
 
FMC Technologies increased earnings in first quarter 2003, primarily due to the strength of its energy businesses. Within Energy Production Systems, subsea systems' sales were strong due to the secular trend toward offshore deepwater development. U.S. land-based exploration and production activity is increasing. Economic activity in the United States was slow throughout the first quarter, but FoodTech performed well and Airport Systems remained profitable despite poor business conditions. The Company continues to expect 2003 earnings in the range of $1.05 to $1.10 per share.
