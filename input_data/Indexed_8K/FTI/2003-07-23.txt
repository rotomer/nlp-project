The following information is being furnished pursuant to Item 12 of Form 8-K "Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and is included under this Item 9 in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8216 (March 23, 2003).
 
On July 23, 2003, FMC Technologies, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2003. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In its second quarter earnings conference call that will occur on July 24, 2003, the chief financial officer of FMC Technologies, Inc. will provide the following information about the Company's interest in Modec International, LLC:
 
"FMC Technologies, Inc. owns

/

ths of Modec International, LLC and the other 5/8ths is owned by MODEC Inc. of Japan which is controlled by Mitsui. MODEC Inc. this month completed an IPO of approximately 11% of the company, which is now traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The prospectus contains some information about FMC Technologies' ownership of MODEC International, LLC that is complex.
 
"In our ownership agreement for MODEC International, LLC we have a provision to convert our interest in the joint venture to cash or cash and stock in MODEC Inc. of Japan based on the relative income contributions of the joint venture to MODEC Inc. These rights are not available until 2004. We have no plans to exit the joint venture, but based on current income levels, we estimate that our interest in MODEC International, LLC could be converted into cash or cash and stock equivalent to approximately 13% of MODEC Inc. Obviously, this percentage can change as income levels fluctuate in the future.
 
"Again, we are making this disclosure not because we anticipate conversion of our interest but because the MODEC document can be difficult to interpret and we wanted investors to have a clear explanation of the conversion provision."
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

CHICAGO
HOUSTON, July 23, 2003
 
"We are pleased with the results of the second quarter of 2003, which reflect the continuing strength of our Energy Systems businesses," said Joseph H. Netherland, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our second quarter results were driven by our subsea systems business, as well as our land-based energy businesses, which benefited from increased drilling activity.
 
"Economic conditions in the U.S. continued to discourage capital spending by our domestic FoodTech and commercial airline customers," Netherland continued. "However, based on the strength of our Energy Systems businesses, we are raising the upper end of our full-year 2003 earnings guidance to $1.15 per share."
 
Review of OperationsSecond Quarter 2003
 
Sales for Energy Systems (comprising Energy Production Systems and Energy Processing Systems) were $393 million in the second quarter of 2003, up 19 percent from $331 million in the second
 
quarter of 2002 and 9 percent from $360 million in the first quarter of 2003. Earnings for the current quarter were $28.1 million, up 54 percent from $18.2 million in the same period last year and up 61 percent from $17.5 million in the first quarter of 2003.
 
Energy Production Systems' year-over-year second quarter sales and profits increased 28 percent and 87 percent, respectively. Sales and profits rose sequentially from the first quarter 2003 by 9 percent and 24 percent, respectively. Energy Production Systems' profits increased due to higher sales and margins primarily in the subsea systems business and, to a lesser extent, in the surface systems business.
 
Energy Processing Systems' second quarter profits increased 8 percent on flat sales. Improvements in blending and transfer systems, measurement systems and fluid control businesses all contributed positively to the quarter's profits. Within fluid control, we saw an increase in sales of WECO/Chiksan equipment in the latter part of the quarter.
 
Energy Systems' inbound orders were $297 million for the second quarter, down 12 percent from $338 million in the second quarter of 2002. Sequentially, inbound orders were down 20 percent from $371 million in the first quarter of 2003. Energy Systems' total backlog at the end of the second quarter was $847 million, up 8 percent from $781 million at the end of the second quarter of 2002 and down 10 percent from $944 million at the end of the first quarter of 2003. Energy Production Systems' inbound orders were down 25 percent from the year-ago period and 34 percent sequentially, due to the timing of subsea orders. Energy Processing Systems' inbound order rate increased 23 percent year-over-year and 21 percent sequentially, primarily on the strength of the fluid control business.
 
FoodTech's second quarter sales of $165 million were up 8 percent from $153 million in the second quarter of 2002, and earnings of $15.3 million decreased 9 percent compared to $16.9 million in the year-ago period. Sales were up due to the impact of foreign currency and increased volumes of food processing equipment, although a shift in product mix reduced profits.
 
Airport Systems' second quarter sales of $53 million were down 12 percent from $60 million in the second quarter of 2002, and earnings of $1.9 million were down 42 percent from $3.3 million in the prior-year period. Lower sales of Halvorsen loaders and Jetway systems were partially offset by higher sales of ground support equipment outside of the United States. Domestic sales of ground support equipment remained weak due to low capital spending by the domestic airline industry.
 
Corporate expenses in the second quarter of 2003 were $6.3 million, flat with the prior-year period. Other expense, net, of $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2003 compared with $3.8 million in the
 
prior-year period. Net interest expense in the second quarter of 2003 was $2.5 million, down from $3.3 million in the second quarter of 2002. Due to strong cash flow, debt less cash at the end of the second quarter of 2003 was $192 million, down from $214 million at the end of the first quarter of 2003.
 
Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter of 2003 was $14.5 million. Capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2003 totaled $13.7 million.
 
Summary
 
FMC Technologies increased earnings in the second quarter 2003, primarily due to the strength of its energy businesses. Within Energy Systems, subsea systems sales and profits were strong due to the secular trend toward offshore deepwater development, while improved drilling activity positively affected the Company's surface completion and WECO/Chiksan businesses. Poor economic conditions in the United States adversely affected the food processing and commercial airline industries. The U.S. economy has not yet significantly improved, and most domestic commercial airlines are expected to experience financial difficulties during the foreseeable future. However, on the strength of the Company's Energy Systems businesses, management is increasing the upper end of full-year 2003 earnings per share guidance to $1.15, from $1.10.
