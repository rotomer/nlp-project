HOUSTON
CHICAGO, October 27, 2003
 
"We had a strong third quarter, reflecting the continuing strength of our Energy Systems businesses," said Joseph H. Netherland, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our third quarter results were driven by our subsea systems business as well as our surface and fluid control businesses, which benefited from increased drilling activity. Earnings from our Energy Systems businesses in the third quarter improved 24 percent over the prior year. We remain on target to achieve our full-year 2003 earnings forecast at the upper end of the range of $1.05 to $1.15 per diluted share."
 
 
Review of Operations  Third Quarter 2003
 
Sales for Energy Systems, comprising Energy Production Systems and Energy Processing Systems were $375.6 million in the third quarter of 2003, up 11 percent from $339.9
million in the third quarter of 2002. Earnings for the third quarter were $22.1 million, up from $17.8 million in the same period last year.
 
Energy Production Systems' third quarter sales and profits increased 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively, over last year. Energy Production Systems' sales increased due to higher sales in the subsea and surface systems businesses. Segment operating profit improvements were driven by the surface and subsea businesses where gains were more than sufficient to offset lower margins from the floating production systems business due in part to the Sonatrach contract.
 
Energy Processing Systems' third quarter sales and profits increased 8 percent and 56 percent, respectively, over the prior-year third quarter. The sales improvement was the result of strength in the fluid control and measurement businesses. Improvements in both the fluid control and loading systems businesses contributed positively to the quarter's profits. Strength in U.S. land drilling activity positively affected sales and profits of WECO/Chiksan equipment.
 
Energy Systems' inbound orders were $316.4 million for the third quarter, down 2 percent from $321.7 million in the third quarter of 2002. Sequentially, inbound orders were up 7 percent from $296.9 million in the second quarter of 2003. Energy Systems' total backlog at the end of the third quarter was $788.0 million, up 3 percent from $762.9 million at the end of the third quarter of 2002, but down 7 percent from $847.2 million at the end of the second quarter of 2003.
 
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders for the quarter were down 4 percent from the year-ago period due primarily to delays in subsea project award decisions partially offset by increases in floating production systems. Inbound orders were up 13 percent sequentially as higher floating production systems orders more than offset the effect of subsea project award delays. Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders for the quarter increased 4 percent over the prior year on strong fluid control and loading systems orders, but decreased 4 percent sequentially, due primarily to large inbound orders in the second quarter for fluid control equipment.
 
FoodTech's third quarter sales of $127.2 million were up 6 percent from $120.4 million in the third quarter of 2002, and earnings of $9.9 million increased 29 percent compared to $7.7 million in the year-ago period. Segment operating profit benefited from higher sales volumes and lower costs including an adjustment made for a foreign sales tax.
 
Airport Systems' third quarter sales of $58.7 million were down 11 percent from $66.3 million in the third quarter of 2002, while earnings of $5.3 million were down 10 percent from $5.9 million in the prior-year period. The earnings decline is the result of lower sales of Halvorsen loaders partially offset by improvements in sales of ground support equipment outside of the United States and, to a lesser extent, improvements in the Jetway passenger boarding bridge business.
 
Corporate expense in the third quarter of 2003 of $5.9 million compared with the prior-year period expense of $5.6 million. Other expense, net, of $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2003 compared with other income, net, of $0.9 million in the prior-year period, which included a gain on sale of a corporate aircraft. Net interest expense in the third quarter of 2003 was $2.2 million, down from $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2002.
 
During the quarter the company invested $50 million to acquire a controlling interest in CDS Engineering and made a $15 million contribution to its pension fund. However, net debt increased only $26 million to $218 million from $192 million at the end of the second quarter.
 
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter of 2003 was $14.5 million. Capital
expenditures during the third quarter of 2003 totaled $15.2 million.
 
 
Summary and Outlook
 
FMC Technologies reported strong third quarter results, primarily due to the strength of its Energy Systems businesses. Subsea systems sales and profits were strong while increased drilling activity positively affected the Company's surface completion and WECO/Chiksan businesses. FoodTech sales and earnings improved on higher food processing and citrus volumes. Airport Systems showed some profit improvement in the ground support equipment and Jetway businesses; however, overall profit declined due to lower volumes of Halvorsen loaders. Management maintains full-year 2003 earnings guidance at the upper end of the range of its $1.05 to $1.15 per diluted share estimate.
 
After two years of rapid subsea growth, the Company expects to see subsea revenues decline in 2004. This, combined with uncertainty over the profitability of the Sonatrach contract, will slow the growth of the Energy Production Systems business in 2004. Energy Processing Systems is expected to benefit from higher levels of oilfield activity while FoodTech and Airport Systems are expected to benefit from improved general economic conditions. Overall, the Company expects full-year 2004 earnings per share to increase in the vicinity of 10 percent over 2003.
