"We are pleased with our results in 2003. We delivered solid sales growth of 11 percent, grew earnings per share by 18 percent compared with 2002 and achieved record backlog of $1.26 billion," said Joseph H. Netherland, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We further reduced our net debt to $193 million, while still investing in our Energy Systems portfolio. Our full year results were driven by our subsea systems business as well as our surface and fluid control businesses, which benefited from increased drilling activity. Operating profit from our Energy

Systems businesses improved 24 percent over the prior year. Based on current market and economic conditions, and our solid backlog, we continue to estimate diluted earnings per share for full year 2004 to be in the vicinity of 10 percent above 2003."
 
Review of Operations  Fourth Quarter 2003
 
Sales for Energy Systems, comprising Energy Production Systems and Energy Processing Systems, were $436.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, up 14 percent from $383.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Energy Systems' operating profit for the fourth quarter was $28.6 million, up from $27.6 million in the same period last year.
 
Energy Systems' inbound orders were $660.6 million for the fourth quarter, up 19 percent from $553.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Sequentially, inbound orders were up 109 percent from $316.4 million in the third quarter of 2003. Energy Systems' total backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was a record $1.01 billion, up 9 percent from $932.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2002 and up 28 percent from $788.0 million at the end of the third quarter of 2003.
 
Energy Production Systems' fourth quarter sales of $309.4 million increased 13 percent over the prior year, due largely to higher surface and floating production systems sales and the addition of separation systems. Segment operating profit was essentially flat with 2002. Operating profit improvements in floating production systems, due to income from our MODEC International LLC joint venture, and from the acquisition of separation systems were offset primarily by higher bid costs for subsea projects.
 
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders were $526.6 million for the fourth quarter, up 18 percent from the prior-year period, due primarily to strong subsea project awards, including orders for the Ormen Lange and Enfield developments, which more than offset the Sonatrach order received in 2002. Inbound orders more than doubled sequentially on substantially higher subsea project awards as well as surface and floating systems orders.
 
Energy Processing Systems' fourth quarter sales and operating profit increased 16 percent and 11 percent, respectively, over the prior-year fourth quarter. The sales improvement was the result of strength in the fluid control and loading systems businesses. Strength in U.S. land drilling activity positively affected sales and profits of WECO/Chiksan equipment compared with 2002, due to strong service company demand. Improvements in fluid control contributed to the quarterly profit improvement.

Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were $134.0 million for the fourth quarter, up 23 percent over the prior year and 22 percent sequentially, primarily due to material handling orders and, to a lesser extent, measurement solutions and loading systems.
 
FoodTech's sales in the fourth quarter of $136.9 million were up 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2002, due mainly to the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. Operating profit of $12.6 million decreased 13 percent when compared to the prior-year period, due to a charge for the divestiture of the domestic harvester product line and lower food processing margins, partially offset by favorable exchange rates.
 
Airport Systems' fourth quarter sales of $66.0 million were essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2002, while operating profit of $4.4 million was down 21 percent from $5.6 million in the prior-year period. The operating profit decline is the result of lower sales of Halvorsen loaders, partially offset by higher sales of ground support equipment mainly to international customers, and improvements in the Jetway passenger boarding bridge business.
 
Corporate expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $7.0 million, $0.5 million above prior-year period expense of $6.5 million. Other expense, net, of $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 increased $0.1 million compared with the prior-year period. Net interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $2.0 million, down from $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, due primarily to lower interest rates and lower average debt.
 
Net debt decreased $25.4 million to $192.5 million at year end from $217.9 million at the end of the third quarter on strong cash flow from operations.
 
Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $16.5 million. Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $22.3 million.
 
Review of Operations  Full Year 2003
 
For the full year 2003, sales of $2.31 billion were up 11 percent from $2.07 billion in 2002, reflecting the continued growth of Energy Production Systems, driven by the subsea business. Net income of $75.6 million improved 18 percent over 2002 income of $64.1 million before the effect of an accounting change. Earnings of $1.13 per diluted share improved 18 percent over 2002 earnings per share before the effect of an accounting change.
 
Energy Systems' sales in 2003 of $1.57 billion were up 17 percent from $1.33 billion in 2002 and accounted for 68 percent of FMC Technologies' total sales. Operating profit of $96.3

million was up 24 percent from 2002. Energy Production Systems' sales of $1.14 billion were up 21 percent from 2002, while operating profit of $66.0 million improved 31 percent from 2002, due mainly to the strength of the subsea business. Energy Processing Systems' 2003 sales of $431.7 million improved 9 percent over 2002, while operating profit of $30.3 million improved 12 percent over 2002. Sales improvements were the result of increased demand for WECO/Chiksan product lines, increased measurement solutions volume and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating profit improvements were driven by the demand from service companies and margin improvements in measurement solutions.
 
Energy Systems' inbound orders for the full year 2003 of $1.65 billion increased 3 percent over 2002. Energy Production Systems' inbound was $2.9 million above 2002 levels, as the 20 percent increase in subsea project awards year-over-year exceeded the large inbound in 2002 for the $240 million Sonatrach contract. Record subsea inbound of $888.3 million is 74 percent of Energy Production Systems' 2003 order inbound. Energy Processing Systems' inbound of $458.9 million is also at record levels, increasing 15 percent over 2002. All businesses within the segment showed order improvement over 2002. Stronger service company demand increased WECO/Chiksan orders, while loading systems experienced stronger LNG demand. Measurement solutions experienced stronger metering systems demand and blending and transfer saw stronger inbound from conveying demand used for coal handling.
 
FoodTech's sales in 2003 of $524.7 million increased 6 percent from 2002 due to favorable foreign exchange rates. Operating profit of $44.0 million for 2003 was slightly above prior year. Favorable foreign exchange and the absence of expenses associated with cost reduction initiatives incurred in 2002 were largely offset by a charge for the divestiture of the U.S. harvester product line, lower tomato processing margins and continued competitive pressure in the food handling market. Backlog of $117.6 million is 10 percent above prior-year levels.
 
Airport Systems' sales in 2003 of $224.1 million were $21.0 million, or 9 percent below 2002 levels. Lower Halvorsen volumes, with 91 units shipped in 2003 compared to 133 units in 2002, were the primary driver of the year-over-year decline. Operating profit of $12.4 million was 22 percent below prior levels. Continued improvements in the margin of commercial products partially offset the Halvorsen loader volume decline. Backlog at year end was $129.5 million which is 16 percent above the prior-year level. An increase in the backlog of commercial products more than offset the decline in the Halvorsen loader backlog.

Corporate expenses for the full year 2003 were $25.3 million, up 5 percent from the prior year. Other expense, net, for 2003 totaled $11.9 million compared to $9.7 million in 2002, largely due to higher pension expense, and the absence of the 2002 gain on the sale of a corporate aircraft. Net interest expense was $8.9 million compared to 2002 net interest expense of $12.5 million. Depreciation and amortization for 2003 was $57.7 million, up $9.1 million from 2002. Capital expenditures of $80.2 million include $15.0 million for the repurchase of sale-leaseback assets.
 
Summary
 
FMC Technologies reported earnings per diluted share of $1.13 for the full year 2003. On the strength of its Energy Systems business, earnings improved 18 percent over 2002 earnings per diluted share of $0.96 before the effect of a change in accounting. Subsea systems sales and profits grew 20 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Increased drilling activity positively affected the Company's surface completion and WECO/Chiksan businesses. FoodTech sales and operating profit benefited from favorable foreign exchange rates. Airport Systems showed some profit improvement in the ground support equipment and Jetway businesses; however, overall profit declined due to lower volumes of Halvorsen loaders. Backlog reached $1.26 billion on strong subsea order awards in 2003, with all segments showing year-over-year increases. The Company maintains its estimate for earnings per share growth for 2004 in the vicinity of 10 percent.
