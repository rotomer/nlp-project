Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated as income before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles plus after-tax interest expense as a percentage of total average debt and equity. The calculation of 2001 ROI uses after-tax profit on a pro-forma basis, which is a non-GAAP measure. See Appendix II.

Appendix II
Year Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2001
After-tax profit (non-GAAP measure) $ 50.5
Less: Restructuring and asset impairment charges, net of income taxes (10.4)
Less: Income tax charges related to the Separation from FMC Corporation (8.9)
Plus: Pro forma interest expense, net income taxes 4.7
Income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (GAAP measure) $ 35.9
It is our view that after-tax profit on a pro forma basis of $54.0 million is a useful measure of our performance in 2001, because it excludes restructuring charges related to initiatives undertaken to lower our cost structure in response to adverse market conditions. It also excludes income tax provisions related to repatriation of offshore earnings and the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of our separation from FMC Corporation, and it adds an estimate of interest expense that we might have incurred had we been a stand-alone entity for the entire year of 2001.
