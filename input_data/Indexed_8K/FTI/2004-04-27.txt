HOUSTON, April 27, 2004
 
"We delivered a strong 2004 first quarter, with solid sales growth of 13 percent and earnings per share growth of 67 percent compared with the first quarter of 2003," said Joseph H. Netherland, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Net income of $13.4 million improved $5.5 million, largely on margin improvements in Energy Systems, primarily attributable to our subsea and surface businesses as well as our fluid control business. Based on current market conditions and our solid backlog, we are increasing our full year 2004 diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of 10 to 15 percent above 2003."
 
Review of Operations  First Quarter 2004
 
Sales for Energy Systems, comprising Energy Production Systems and Energy Processing Systems, were $402.8 million in the first quarter of 2004, up 12 percent from $359.9 million in the first quarter of 2003. Energy Systems' operating profit for the first quarter was $25.5 million, up from $17.5 million in the same period last year, resulting in a 46 percent increase over the prior-year quarter.
 
Energy Systems' inbound orders were $375.1 million for the first quarter, up slightly from $371.2 million in the first quarter of 2003, despite the delays in major West African subsea project award announcements. Energy Systems' total backlog at the end of the first quarter was $984.7 million, up 4 percent from $943.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2003.
 
Energy Production Systems' first quarter sales of $296.3 million increased 12 percent over the prior year, largely due to higher floating production and surface systems sales and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. Subsea revenue of $192 million was $2 million below the prior-year quarter. Segment operating profit of $20.8 million was up 29 percent from the first quarter of 2003. Margin improvement in subsea was a key driver. Additionally, both the surface and floating production systems businesses delivered margin improvements over the prior-year quarter.
 
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders of $260.7 million for the first quarter were down $17.0 million from the prior-year period. Increased orders in the surface business and separation systems were offset by lower subsea orders, due to major project award announcement delays, and the $15.3 million reduction of the Sonatrach contract value due to the agreed-upon scope reduction. Energy Production Systems' backlog of $845.1 million is $10.3 million higher than the prior-year first quarter, but down $35.6 million sequentially.
 
Energy Processing Systems' first quarter sales of $109.4 million increased 16 percent over the prior-year first quarter due to increased demand for measurement solutions, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates as well as increased demand for LNG marine loading arms and increased demand from service companies for WECO
/Chiksan
equipment. Operating profit of $4.7 million increased $3.3 million when compared to the first quarter of 2003. The absence of costs for severance and a contract dispute as well as improvements in fluid control and loading systems operating margins contributed to the significant improvement in operating profit for Energy Processing Systems.
 
Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were $118.6 million for the first quarter, up 27 percent over the prior year, primarily due to increased demand for measurement solutions. Energy Processing Systems' backlog of $146.4 million is up 34 percent over the first quarter of 2003, on stronger demand for material handling and measurement solutions products.
 
FoodTech's sales in the first quarter of $103.4 million were up 8 percent from the first quarter of 2003, due mainly to increased demand for freezers in North America and Asia and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. Operating profit of $4.6 million decreased 26 percent compared with the prior-year period. Lower margins were due mainly to a later crop in the citrus equipment business. Inbound of $153.9 million was up slightly over the prior-year quarter. Backlog of $168.1 million improved 2 percent over the prior-year quarter.
 
Airport Systems' first quarter sales of $58.1 million were 25 percent higher compared with the first quarter of 2003, while operating profit of $2.0 million was $1.2 million higher than the prior-year period. Margin improvement for ground support equipment and Jetway products more than offset the impact of lower sales of Halvorsen loaders. Inbound orders were $55.6 million in the first quarter of 2004, up 8 percent from the prior-year quarter resulting from increased demand in the Jetway business. Backlog of $127.0 million is up 8 percent over the prior-year quarter.
 
Corporate expense in the first quarter of 2004 was $6.4 million, $0.5 million above the prior-year period expense of $5.9 million. Other expense, net, of $4.8 million decreased $0.8 million compared with the prior-year period due to lower expenses related to the outsourcing of the Company's employee service center. Net interest expense in the first quarter of 2004 was $2.0 million, down from $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2003, due primarily to lower interest rates and lower average debt.
 
Debt, less cash, at the end of the first quarter of 2004 was $207.3 million, up from $192.5 million at year-end 2003. Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter of 2003 was $16.5 million. Capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2004 totaled $10.3 million.
 
Summary
 
FMC Technologies reported earnings per diluted share of $0.20 for the first quarter 2004. On the strength of its Energy Systems business, earnings improved 67 percent over 2003 earnings per diluted share of $0.12. Backlog grew to $1.3 billion despite delayed major subsea project order award announcements. Energy Systems' revenue grew 12 percent over 2003 and operating profit improved 46 percent on subsea margin improvement and strength in material handling demand. Additionally, increased rig activity positively affected the Company's surface and fluid control businesses. FoodTech revenue increased on higher freezer volume and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates; however, operating profit was lower due mainly to the effect of a later Florida crop on the citrus equipment business. Airport Systems showed continued profit improvement in the ground support equipment and Jetway businesses which more than offset the decline from lower volumes of Halvorsen loaders. Based on strong backlog and current market conditions, the Company increased its estimated full-year 2004 earnings per diluted share to a range of 10 to 15 percent over 2003.
