(c) Exhibits: The following exhibit is furnished as part of this report:
 
 
 
FMC Technologies, Inc. has discovered that it inadvertently used an incorrect slide in a presentation at Howard Weil's 32
nd
Annual Energy Conference in New Orleans, Louisiana on March 29, 2004. The slide, entitled Appendix II, showed a reconciliation of after-tax profit (a non-GAAP measure) to income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (a GAAP measure). Instead, the slide should have showed a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting changes (a GAAP measure) to EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure). The incorrect slide was also included in the registrant's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 26, 2004 (SEC file number 001-16489) pursuant to which the registrant furnished a portion of the slides presented during the conference. A complete set of the slides included with the previously filed Form 8-K, including the correct reconciliation slide as Appendix II, is attached hereto as an exhibit to this report and is incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference.
 
These slides will also be made available at the Company's website ().
