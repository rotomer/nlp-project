Inbound orders of $675 million increased 38 percent from the prior-year quarter due primarily to subsea project orders. Backlog of $1.6 billion includes $1.0 billion of subsea orders.

HOUSTON, October 25, 2004
 
"We had a strong third quarter, reflecting the continuing strength of our Energy Systems businesses," said Joseph H. Netherland, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our third quarter results were driven by our subsea systems business as well as our surface and fluid control businesses which benefited from increased drilling activity. Operating profits from our Energy Systems businesses in the third quarter improved 32 percent over the prior-year quarter. Backlog in Energy Systems is a record $1.35 billion. Based on current market conditions and our solid year-to-date performance, we remain on track to achieve our full-year 2004 diluted earnings per share estimate, which is in the range of 15 to 20 percent above 2003."

Review of Operations  Third Quarter 2004
 
Sales for Energy Systems, comprising Energy Production Systems and Energy Processing Systems, were $488.1 million in the third quarter of 2004, up 30 percent from $375.6 million in the third quarter of 2003. Energy Systems' operating profit for the third quarter was $29.1 million, up from $22.1 million in the same quarter last year.
 
Energy Systems' inbound orders were $489.6 million for the third quarter, up $173.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2003. Strong inbound in subsea of $295 million was the primary driver for the quarter-over-quarter order improvement. Energy Systems' total backlog at the end of the third quarter was a record $1.35 billion compared to $788 million at the end of the third quarter of 2003.
 
Energy Production Systems' third quarter sales of $363.6 million increased 34 percent over the prior-year quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was due mainly to higher subsea systems sales and higher sales in floating production systems as the CNR, Santos and Sonatrach projects progress. The impact of foreign currency translation also contributed to the growth in sales over the prior-year quarter. Subsea revenue of $255 million was $57 million above the prior-year quarter due to improved sales in all major basins except the Gulf of Mexico. Segment operating profit of $20.2 million was up 44 percent from the third quarter of 2003 due largely to margin improvement and increased volume in the subsea and surface systems businesses. This operating profit improvement was partially offset by a $4.4 million loss provision associated with an increase of our total project cost estimate to complete the Sonatrach project.
 
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders of $379.7 million for the third quarter were $172.8 million above the prior-year quarter. Subsea project orders drove the increase in inbound orders over the prior-year quarter. Energy Production Systems' backlog of $1.2 billion is $561.4 million higher than the prior-year third quarter on the strength of subsea orders. Subsea backlog exceeded $1.0 billion at the end of the third quarter.
 
Energy Processing Systems' third quarter sales of $126.6 million increased 19 percent over the prior-year quarter due to higher demand for liquid measurement equipment in Europe and material handling equipment in the United States. The impact of favorable foreign currency translation also contributed to the sales growth over the prior-year quarter. Operating profit of $8.9 million improved $0.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2003 due mainly to strong demand for WECO/Chiksan products from service companies and volume and margin improvement in the

material handling business resulting from a strengthening U.S. market. Lower margins in the loading systems business due to project execution and changes in sales mix together with lower production manifold business only partially offset the operating profit improvement in the quarter.
 
Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were $110.6 million for the third quarter, up slightly from the prior-year quarter. FMC Technologies continues to see strong demand for WECO/Chiksan products from service companies as well as demand for material handling systems. This increase in order inbound is partially offset by the delayed inbound for loading systems projects. Energy Processing Systems' backlog of $130 million was essentially flat compared to the prior-year quarter.
 
FoodTech's third quarter sales of $137.8 million were 8 percent higher compared with the third quarter of 2003. Strong sales of freezing systems in North America and Asia and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation were the primary drivers of the increased sales over the prior-year quarter. Operating profits of $8.3 million were $1.6 million below the prior-year quarter due to a favorable adjustment for foreign sales taxes recognized in the third quarter of 2003. Improvements in freezing systems and lower costs that partly resulted from the sale of a harvester product line in 2003 were offset by the impact of competitive pressure in the citrus business and, to a lesser extent, lower sales of products associated with grapefruit processing as a direct result of the Florida hurricanes. Inbound of $127.0 million was flat compared to the prior-year quarter. Backlog of $131.0 million was up 9 percent over the prior-year quarter due mainly to higher food processing orders in the canning market as well as citrus related projects.
 
Airport Systems' third quarter sales of $76.1 million were 30 percent higher compared with the third quarter of 2003. Sales improved over the prior-year quarter due to stronger demand for Jetway passenger boarding bridges from domestic airlines and airport authorities. Ground support equipment sales improved over the prior-year quarter on increased demand from airport ground handlers and cargo handling companies. Operating profit of $6.1 million was $0.8 million higher than the prior-year quarter due to increased volume offset in part by higher steel costs and an unfavorable product mix. Inbound orders were $60.0 million in the third quarter of 2004, up 29 percent from the prior-year quarter due mainly to stronger demand for passenger boarding bridges as well as an order from the U.S. Air Force for additional work on in-service Halvorsen loaders. Backlog of $131.0 million was up 16 percent over the prior-year quarter.
 
Corporate expense in the third quarter of 2004 was $6.3 million, $0.6 million above the prior-year period. Other expense, net, of $4.8 million increased $1.2 million compared with the prior-year

period due to an expense adjustment relating to an international benefit plan. Net interest expense in the third quarter of 2004 was $1.4 million, down from $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2003, due primarily to lower average debt.
 
Debt, less cash, at the end of the third quarter of 2004 was $167.2 million, up from $112.0 million at the end of the second quarter of 2004 mainly due to the timing of working capital requirements for the Sonatrach project. During the quarter the Company made a $30 million contribution to its pension fund. Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter of 2004 was $15.6 million. Capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2004 totaled $10.5 million.
 
Summary and Outlook
 
FMC Technologies reported earnings per diluted share of $0.32 for the third quarter 2004 compared to $0.28 in the prior-year quarter. Backlog remained solid at $1.6 billion on the strength of subsea. Energy Systems' revenue grew 30 percent and operating profit improved 32 percent over the prior-year quarter on the strength of the subsea and surface businesses. FoodTech revenue increased mainly due to freezing systems and favorable foreign currency translation, while operating profit decreased due to competitive pressures in the citrus business and a favorable sales tax adjustment recognized in the third quarter of 2003. Airport Systems showed continued profit improvement in the Jetway
and ground support equipment businessesFMC Technologies maintains its guidance for full-year 2004 earnings per diluted share in the range of 15 to 20 percent over 2003.
.
 
FMC Technologies estimates that full-year 2005 earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $1.30 to $1.50. Energy Production Systems is expected to show strong growth over 2004 on the strength of the subsea business. Energy Processing Systems should continue to show growth over 2004 as rig activity remains strong. The FoodTech segment is anticipated to be flat to slightly up, reflecting the impact of the 2004 Florida hurricanes on operating profits in the citrus business. Airport Systems should be flat to slightly up from the performance in 2004.
