SECTION 9  Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
(c) Exhibits:
 
 
Exhibit 99.1 to this report contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Management reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP performance measures utilized for internal analysis provide financial statement users meaningful comparisons between current and prior period results, as well as important information regarding performance trends. These non-GAAP financial measures may be inconsistent with similar measures provided by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
