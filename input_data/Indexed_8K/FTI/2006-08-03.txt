Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
2006 Management Incentive Awards On July 28, 2006, the Compensation Committee of FMC Technologies Board of Directors approved the modification of the annual target incentive percentages on which management incentive awards in the form of cash bonus awards, for certain participating managers, including named executive officers, will be based for 2006 under FMC Technologies Incentive Compensation and Stock Plan. Management incentive awards provide for annual cash incentives for achievement of both annual performance incentive ("API") targets and business performance incentive ("BPI") targets. For participating managers, including the Companys named executive officers, the management incentive awards are determined using three variables: (1) the individuals annual incentive target, which for 2006 will now be based on a percentage of base salary ranging from 24% to 110% (modifying the prior percentage range of 24% to 100%); (2) achievement of the API and BPI targets and (3) weightings for the objectives. For 2006 incentive awards, the API will continue to comprise 30% of the total target incentive and the BPI will continue to comprise 70% of the total target incentive for participating managers. BPI payments can range from 0 to 3 times the annual target incentive and for named executive officers will be based on Net Contribution and EBITDA. The API rating varies with individual performance versus annual performance objectives and can range from 0 to 2 times the annual target incentive.
