 FMC Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: FTI) today reported third quarter 2006 revenue of $960.8 million, up 24 percent over the third quarter of 2005 on the strength of subsea systems, surface wellhead and WECO/Chiksan products. Net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $61.0 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, an increase of 34 percent over the prior-year quarter of $0.65 per diluted share. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2005 included a positive $0.22 diluted earnings per share impact from the sale of MODEC Inc. stock.
HOUSTON, October 24, 2006

"We are pleased with the continued strong performance of the Company.

Review of Operations  Third Quarter 2006
Energy Production Systems
Energy Production Systems' third quarter revenues of $585.6 million increased 37 percent over the prior-year quarter, due mainly to higher subsea systems revenue of $445 million, which was up 38 percent from the prior-year quarter. Surface wellhead systems' revenue improved 28 percent over the prior-year period.
Energy Production Systems' operating profit of $53.4 million was $36.6 million higher than the prior-year quarter. The operating profit improvement is due principally to higher volumes and higher margins for subsea systems. Surface wellhead and floating production systems both contributed higher volume and margin improvement than during the prior-year quarter. Additionally, Energy Production Systems' third quarter 2005 segment operating profit included a $16.0 million loss provision for the Sonatrach contract.
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders were $423.1 million for the third quarter, down 7 percent from the prior-year quarter. Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion, up 10 percent from the prior-year quarter but down sequentially due to the timing of subsea project award announcements.
Energy Processing Systems
Energy Processing Systems' third quarter revenue of $174.7 million was 32 percent higher than the prior-year period. The revenue improvement was the result of strong demand for WECO/Chiksan equipment from service companies, as well as a stronger demand for material handling equipment for mining and construction bulk conveying projects.
Energy Processing Systems' third quarter operating profit of $27.0 million was $11.8 million higher than in the third quarter of 2005. The operating profit improvement was primarily the result of higher WECO/Chiksan equipment volume and operating margins.
Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were $210.0 million for the third quarter, up 46 percent from the prior-year quarter due mainly to stronger demand for WECO/Chiksan equipment as well as orders for a new well service pump offering. Inbound orders for material handling and measurement systems are also higher than the prior-year quarter. Backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2006 was $ 272.8 million, up 59 percent from the prior-year quarter, and up 15 percent from the previous quarter.

FoodTech
FoodTech's third quarter revenue of $113.0 million was down 15 percent from the third quarter of 2005 due primarily to a slowing North American poultry market and reduced volumes for canning and sterilization equipment. Operating profit of $9.5 million improved 13 percent from the prior-year period, due mainly to some improvement in citrus processing, which was offset in part by the slowing in the North American poultry market. Inbound orders were $121.1 million for the third quarter of 2006, down 11 percent from the third quarter of 2005. Backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2006 was $149.2 million, down 5 percent from the third quarter of 2005.
Airport Systems
Airport Systems' third quarter revenue of $89.3 million was $3.4 million greater than the prior-year quarter due mainly to higher volume of Jetway passenger boarding bridges and equipment and higher Airport Services' revenue due to growth from new service locations. Airport Systems' third quarter operating profit of $8.5 million was flat compared to the prior-year period as volume increases were offset by an operating margin decline in Jetway.
Airport Systems' inbound orders were $99.4 million, up 50 percent from the prior-year quarter. Backlog grew sequentially to a quarterly record of $184.2 million due in part to the earlier receipt of the Halvorsen Loader order and strength in the passenger boarding bridge market for future year deliveries.
Corporate Items
Corporate expense in the third quarter of 2006 was $8.5 million, $0.9 million above prior-year period. Other expense, net, was $5.0 million, down $3.9 million from the prior-year quarter, due mainly to fluctuations in nonqualified plan investments and the absence of foreign exchange losses in 2006. Corporate items in the third quarter of 2005 included a $25.3 million gain from the sale of MODEC, Inc. stock.
Net interest expense in the third quarter of 2006 was $1.4 million, down from $1.6 million in the prior-year quarter.

Debt, less cash, at the end of the third quarter was $164.1 million, up slightly from $152.3 million at the end of the prior quarter, due mainly to working capital increases and capital spending to support Energy Systems' growth and stock repurchases. In the third quarter of 2006, $47.7 million of cash was used to repurchase 805,500 shares of FMC Technologies common stock.
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter of 2006 was $18.4 million, up from $16.5 million in the prior-year quarter.
Capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2006 totaled $35.6 million, up from $21.8 million in the prior-year quarter due primarily to capacity expansion projects in Energy Systems businesses.
Summary and Outlook
FMC Technologies reported revenue of $960.8 million in the third quarter of 2006, up 24 percent over prior-year quarter. Net income was $61.0 million, or $0.87 per diluted share on the strength of subsea systems, surface wellhead and WECO/Chiksan products. Subsea systems' revenue grew 38 percent over the prior-year quarter. The Company's surface wellhead and WECO/Chiksan businesses also contributed to the increased revenue and operating profit. Despite lower FoodTech revenue, operating profit improved 13 percent over the prior-year quarter mainly from stronger citrus business performance. Airport Systems' revenue was up slightly, but operating profits were flat. Total company backlog of $2.2 billion declined from $2.3 billion from the second quarter on delayed subsea inbound orders; the Company believes, however, that subsea inbound orders should increase during the next six to nine months as a number of large subsea projects are awarded.
The Company increased its estimate for full-year 2006 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $3.20 to $3.25.
The Company estimates its full year 2007 diluted earnings per share in a range of $3.70 to $3.90.
