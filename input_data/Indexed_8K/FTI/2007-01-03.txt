SECTION 2  Financial Information
ITEM 2.01. COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.
On December 29, 2006, FMC Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") completed the sale of its Floating Systems business to MODEC, Inc. for $54.4 million in cash. The sales agreement was previously announced on November 29, 2006. The Company's Floating Systems business develops and manufactures SOFEC turrets and mooring systems for floating production storage and offloading vessels and offshore marine loading systems.
Until the sale date, Floating Systems' results were consolidated into the Energy Production Systems segment of the Company's financial statements. Subsequent to the sale, the Company has no continuing involvement in floating production systems. Accordingly, in the Company's 2006 annual report on Form 10-K, Floating Systems' results, as well as those of a minor FoodTech unit, will be reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
The Company, through its Floating Systems subsidiary, was a partner in the MODEC International LLC joint venture with MODEC, Inc. until 2004, at which time the Company sold its share of the joint venture to MODEC, Inc. for a combination of cash and common stock. In 2005, the Company sold all of its shares of MODEC, Inc. common stock, thereby ending the related party affiliation.
