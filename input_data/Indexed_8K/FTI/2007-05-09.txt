 FMC Technologies, Inc.

HOUSTON, May 9, 2007
Inbound orders in the quarter totaled $1.3 billion. Total Company backlog reached $3.0 billion, including $2.0 billion for subsea systems.
"Our strong first quarter results were again driven by our subsea systems, fluid control, and our surface wellhead businesses," said Peter D. Kinnear, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "Operating margins in our energy segments were strong, backlog is at another record high, future subsea project opportunities are robust and we believe the outlook for 2007 remains very positive. We remain on schedule to deliver the industry's first full-scale subsea separation system in the fourth quarter, and we believe this new technology should drive growth beyond 2007."
