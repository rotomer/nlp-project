Review of Operations  Fourth Quarter 2007
Energy Production Systems
Energy Production Systems' fourth quarter revenue of $867.0 million increased 37 percent over the prior-year quarter due mainly to increased subsea systems sales. Revenue for subsea systems was $686 million in the quarter, up 35 percent from the prior-year quarter. Surface wellhead revenue improved over 40 percent from the prior-year quarter.
Energy Production Systems' operating profit of $85.5 million increased 66 percent over the prior-year quarter. The increase was due to higher volume and operating margin in subsea systems and due to higher volume in surface wellhead.
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders were $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter, up $1.0 billion over the prior-year quarter due to the strength of orders for subsea systems. Subsea systems' inbound orders were $2.0 billion in the quarter primarily driven by the Total Pazflor award which had a value of approximately $980 million. The Pazflor project was the second award in the quarter that included subsea processing systems.
Energy Production backlog of $4.2 billion was up 105 percent from the prior-year quarter and up 43 percent sequentially. Subsea backlog was a record $3.9 billion at the end of the quarter.
 
 
Energy Processing Systems
Energy Processing Systems' fourth quarter revenue of $210.9 million was 13 percent higher than the prior-year quarter. The revenue improvement over the prior-year quarter was the result of demand from service companies for fluid control products including WECO/Chiksan equipment, which were up over 18 percent from the prior-year quarter, and from strong demand for measurement solutions' products and systems in the oil and gas pipeline infrastructure market.
Energy Processing Systems' fourth quarter operating profit of $39.3 million was 66 percent higher than the prior-year quarter. The improvement was the result of higher volume in both fluid control and measurement solutions as well as the absence of one-time costs incurred in the prior-year quarter.
Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were $184.3 million for the fourth quarter, down 16 percent from the prior-year quarter. Backlog was $330.5 million, up 8 percent from the prior-year quarter on strong measurement solutions orders.
FoodTech
FoodTech's revenue of $172.1 million in the fourth quarter was up 22 percent from the prior-year quarter due to increased sales in North America and Europe. Operating profit of $19.8 million was up 39 percent from the prior-year quarter on the higher volume.
Inbound orders totaled $155.2 million in the quarter. Backlog was $164.3 million, up 2 percent from the prior-year quarter despite continued weakness in the North American poultry equipment market.
Airport Systems
Airport Systems' fourth quarter revenue of $116.9 million was up 9 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 due to increased demand for Jetway and ground support equipment. Airport Systems' fourth quarter operating profit of $11.3 million was up 12 percent from the prior-year quarter due to the higher volume.
Inbound orders totaled $97.8 million in the quarter. Backlog was $226.7 million, up 48 percent from the prior-year quarter on the strength of Jetway equipment and loader orders for Europe and Asia.
 
 
Corporate Items
Corporate expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $8.7 million, $0.3 million below the prior-year quarter. Other expense, net, of $1.2 million decreased $10.0 million from the prior-year. The decrease was driven by favorable LIFO inventory related effects and net gains due to foreign currency hedging activities.
Net interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $0.4 million, down $1.1 million from the prior-year quarter due to lower net debt.
The company ended the year in a small net cash position, reducing net debt from the previous quarter by $158.8 million. In the quarter, the Company repurchased 655,350 shares of common stock for $36.6 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $22.3 million, up from $18.5 million in the prior-year quarter.
Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2007 totaled $81.9 million, up from $41.7 million in the prior-year quarter due mainly to capacity expansion projects in Energy Systems and investment in subsea intervention assets.
The company recorded an income tax rate of 36.2 percent for continuing operations in the fourth quarter due to the country mix of income.
