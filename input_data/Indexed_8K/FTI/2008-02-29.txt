Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Amendment of Definitive Material Agreement On February 25, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of FMC Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") approved certain amendments and revisions to the Companys Incentive Compensation and Stock Plan to consolidate previously approved amendments, to reflect the Companys current administrative practice, to change the definition of performance goals to include a specific list of performance measures and to respond to various legal and regulatory requirements, such as those under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation and Stock Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.4(p) hereto.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
2008 Management Incentive Awards On February 25, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors modified the Business Performance Incentive (BPI) factors under the 2008 Management Incentive Plan. BPI payments in 2008 will be based on Net Contribution, EBIT Growth and EBIT Percent of Sales, and each will be equally weighted. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards On February 25, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined that the grant of performance-based restricted shares to the Companys executive officers will constitute 66 2/3% of the total awards granted to each of these officers in 2008. In 2007, 50% of total restricted grant awards to the Companys executive officers were performance-based restricted shares.

EXHIBIT 10.4(p)
SECTION 1.
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Plan is to give the Company a competitive advantage in attracting, retaining and motivating officers, employees, directors and consultants of the Company and its Affiliates.
SECTION 2.
DEFINITIONS
For purposes of the Plan, the following terms are defined as set forth below:
2.1
General
.
in which "A" equals the number of Stock Options, shares of Restricted Stock, Performance Units, Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units with Dividend Equivalent Rights held by the participant on the dividend payment date, "B" equals the cash dividend per share and "C" equals the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the dividend payment date. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee as of the dividend payment date, if a dividend is paid in property other than cash, the number of Stock Options, shares of Restricted Stock Performance Units, Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units as applicable into which a Dividend Equivalent Right will be converted will be calculated, as of the dividend payment date, in accordance with the formula set forth above, except that "B" will equal the fair market value per share of the property which the participant would have received if the Stock Option, share of Restricted Stock
Performance Unit, Stock Unit or Restricted Stock Unit as applicable, with Dividend Equivalent Rights held by the participant on the dividend payment date was a share of Common Stock.
In addition, certain other terms used herein have definitions given to them in the first place in which they are used.
2.2
Other Definitions
.
SECTION 3.
ADMINISTRATION
The Committee is the administrator of the Plan. Among other things, the Committee has the authority, subject to the terms of the Plan:
3.1
Committee Administration
.
The Committee has the authority to adopt, alter and repeal administrative rules, guidelines and practices governing the Plan, to interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan, any Award, any Notice and any other agreement relating to any Award and to take any action it deems appropriate for the administration of the Plan.
The Committee may act only by a majority of its members then in office unless it allocates or delegates its authority to a Committee member or other person to act on its behalf. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or applicable rules of a stock exchange, the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any part of its responsibilities and powers to any other person or persons. Any such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time.
3.2
Committee Action
.
Any determination made by the Committee or its delegate with respect to any Award will be made in the sole discretion of the Committee or such delegate. All decisions of the Committee or its delegate are final, conclusive and binding on all parties.
Any authority granted to the Committee may also be exercised by the full Board. To the extent that any permitted action taken by the Board conflicts with action taken by the Committee, the Board action will control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board is the administrator of the portion of the Plan applicable to Non-Employee Directors.
3.3
Board Authority
.
SECTION 4.
SHARES
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered to participants and their beneficiaries under the Plan will be 24,000,000 (after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split on August 31, 2007). Shares subject to an Award under the Plan may be authorized and unissued shares or may be treasury shares.
4.1
Shares Available For Issuance
.
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to Management Incentive Awards, Restricted Stock, Performance Units, Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units is 16,000,000 (after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split on August 31, 2007).
No Award will be counted against the shares available for delivery under the Plan if the Award is payable to the participant only in the form of cash, or if the Award is paid to the participant in cash.
If any Award is forfeited, or if any Stock Option (and any related Stock Appreciation Right) terminates, expires or lapses without being exercised, or if any Stock Appreciation Right is exercised for cash, the shares of Common Stock subject to such Awards will again be available for delivery in connection with Awards under the Plan. If the option price of any Stock Option granted under the Plan is satisfied by delivering shares of Common Stock to the Company (by either actual delivery or by attestation), only the number of shares of Common Stock delivered to the participant, net of the shares of Common Stock delivered or attested to, will be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum numbers of shares of Common Stock available for delivery under the Plan. To the extent any shares of Common Stock subject to an Award are not delivered to a participant because such shares are used to satisfy an applicable tax-withholding obligation, such shares will not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for delivery under the Plan.
In the event of any corporate event or transaction, (including, but not limited to, a change in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding), such as a stock split, merger, consolidation, separation, including a spin-off or other distribution of stock or property of the Company, any reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Section 368 of the Code) or any partial or complete liquidation of the Company, the Committee shall make such substitution or adjustments in the aggregate number, kind, and price of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, and the maximum limitation upon any Awards to be granted to any participant, in the number, kind and price of shares subject to outstanding Awards granted under the Plan and/or such other equitable substitution or adjustments as it may determines are required to accomplish the same; provided, however, that the number of shares subject to any Award will always be a whole number. Such adjusted price will be used to determine the amount payable in cash or shares, as applicable, by the Company upon the exercise of any Award. Any such adjustment to an Award may be made to the extent that such adjustment does not conflict with Section 409A of the Code.
No participant may be granted Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights covering in excess of 2,400,000 shares (after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split on August 31, 2007) of Common Stock in any calendar year. The maximum aggregate amount with respect to each Management Incentive Award, Award of Performance Units, Award of Restricted Stock, Award of Stock Units or Award of Restricted Stock Units that may be granted, or, that may vest, as applicable, in any calendar year for any individual participant is 2,400,000 shares (after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split on August 31, 2007) of Common Stock, or the dollar equivalent of 2,400,000 shares (after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split on August 31, 2007) of Common Stock.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AWARDS
Awards will be in the form and upon the terms and conditions as determined by the Committee, subject to the terms of the Plan.

.
Each Award vests and becomes fully payable, exercisable and/or released of any restriction on the Vesting Date. The Vesting Date of each Award, as determined by the Committee, will be set forth in the Notice. Prior to the Vesting Date, an Award remains subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

SECTION 7.
QUALIFIED PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS
The Committee may designate a Management Incentive Award, or an Award of Restricted Stock or an Award of Performance Units or an Award of Stock Units or an Award or Restricted Stock Units as a Qualified Performance-Based Award, in which case, the Award is contingent upon the attainment of Performance Goals, and, as a result, remains subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture until the attainment of such Performance Goals.
SECTION 8.

The Committee is authorized to grant Management Incentive Awards, subject to the terms of the Plan. Notices for Management Incentive Awards will indicate the Award Cycle, any applicable Performance Goals, any applicable designation of the Award as a Qualified Performance-Based Award and the form of payment of the Award.

SECTION 9.
STOCK OPTIONS
The Committee is authorized to grant Stock Options, including both Incentive Stock Options and Nonqualified Stock Options, subject to the terms of the Plan. Notices will indicate whether the Stock Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option, the option price, the term and the number of shares to which it pertains. To the extent that any Stock Option is not designated as an Incentive Stock Option, or, even if so designated does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option on or subsequent to its Grant Date, it will constitute a Nonqualified Stock Option.
9.1
Stock Options
.
The option price per share of Common Stock purchasable under a Stock Option will be determined by the Committee and will not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Stock Option on the Grant Date, except as provided under Section 4.1.

A participant can exercise a Stock Option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after the Vesting Date and before the Expiration Date by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Stock Option to be purchased. Such notice will be accompanied by payment in full to the Company of the option price by certified or bank check or such other cash equivalent instrument as the Company may accept. If approved by the Committee, payment in full or in part may also be made in the form of Common Stock (by delivery of such shares or by attestation) already owned by the optionee of the same class as the Common Stock subject to the Stock Option, based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Stock Option is exercised.
9.4

9.5
Settlement

General Provisions
No Stock Option will be transferable by the optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. All Stock Options will be exercisable, subject to the terms of the Plan, only by the optionee, the guardian or legal representative of the optionee, or any person to whom such Stock Option is transferred pursuant to this paragraph, it being understood that the term "holder" and "optionee" include such guardian, legal representative and other transferee. No Stock Option will be subject to execution, attachment or other similar process.
9.6
Nontransferability

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Committee may permit a participant at any time prior to his or her death to assign all or any portion without consideration therefor of a Nonqualified Stock Option to:
In such event, the spouse, lineal descendant, trustee, partnership or custodianship will be entitled to all of the participant's rights with respect to the assigned portion of the Nonqualified Stock Option, and such portion will continue to be subject to all of the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to the Nonqualified Stock Option.
On receipt of written notice of exercise, the Committee may elect to cash out all or part of the portion of the shares of Common Stock for which a Stock Option is being exercised by paying the optionee an amount, in cash or Common Stock, equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock over the option price times the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Stock Option is being exercised on the effective date of such cash-out. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee, either on the Grant Date or thereafter, may give a participant the right to voluntarily cash-out the participant's outstanding Stock Options during the seventy (70)-day period following a Change in Control. A participant who has such a cash-out right and elects to cash-out Stock Options may do so during the seventy (70)-day period following a Change in Control by giving notice to the Company to elect to surrender all or part of the Stock Option to the Company and to receive cash, within thirty (30) days of such election, in an amount equal to the amount by which the Change in Control Price per share of Common Stock on the date of such election exceeds the exercise price per share of Common Stock under the Stock Option multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock granted under the Stock Option as to which this cash-out right is exercised.
9.7
Cashing Out

SECTION 14.
CHANGE IN CONTROL
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control, as of the date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred, any outstanding:
15.1
Impact of Change in Control
.
The Committee may also make additional substitutions, adjustments and/or settlements of outstanding Awards as it deems appropriate and consistent with the Plan's purposes.
For purposes of the Plan, a "Change in Control" means either a "Change in Ownership," a "Change in Effective Control," or a "Change in Ownership of a Substantial Portion of Assets," as defined below:
15.2
Definition of Change in Control
.
"Change in Ownership": A Change in Ownership of the Company occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one Person Acting as a Group (as defined below), acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company. However, if any one person or more than one Person Acting as a Group, is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a Change in Ownership of the Company (or to cause a Change in Effective Control of the Company). An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or Persons Acting as a Group, as a result of a transaction in which the Company acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock. This applies only when there is a transfer of stock of the Company (or issuance of stock of the Company) and stock in the Company remains outstanding after the transaction.
Persons Acting as a Group: Persons will not be considered to be acting as a group solely because they (i) purchase or own stock of the same corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering, or (ii) purchase assets of the same corporation at the same time. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock or assets, or similar business transaction with the Company. If a person, including an entity, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock or assets, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation only with respect to the ownership in that corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.
"Change in Effective Control": A Change in Effective Control of the Company occurs on the date that either 
A Change in Effective Control will have occurred only if the Covered Employee is employed by the Company or an Affiliate upon the date of the Change in Effective Control or the Company is liable for the payment of the benefits hereunder and no other corporation is a majority shareholder of the Company. Further, in the absence of an event described in paragraph (i) or (ii), a Change in Effective Control of the Company will not have occurred.
Acquisition of additional control: If any one person, or more than one Person Acting as a Group, is considered to effectively control the Company, the acquisition of additional control of the Company by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a Change in Effective Control of the Company (or to cause a Change in Ownership of the Company).
"Change in Ownership of a Substantial Portion of Assets": A Change in Ownership of a Substantial Portion of Assets occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one Person Acting as a Group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40% of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.
Transfers to a related person: There is no Change in Control when there is a transfer to an entity that is controlled by the shareholders of the Company immediately after the transfer. A transfer of assets by the Company is not treated as a Change of Ownership of a Substantial Portion of Assets if the assets are transferred to 
A person's status is determined immediately after the transfer of the assets. For example, a transfer to a corporation in which the Company has no ownership interest before the transaction, but which is a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company after the transaction is not treated as a Change in Ownership of a Substantial Portion of Assets of the Company.
For purposes of the Plan, "Change in Control Price" means the higher of (a) the highest reported sales price, regular way, of a share of Common Stock in any transaction reported on the New York Stock Exchange or other national exchange on which such shares are listed during the sixty (60)-day period prior to and including the date of a Change in Control; or (b) if the Change in Control is the result of a tender or exchange offer or a Corporate Transaction, the highest price per share of Common Stock paid in such tender or exchange offer or Corporate Transaction; provided, howeverthat in the case of Incentive Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights relating to Incentive Stock Options, the Change in Control Price will be in all cases the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date such Incentive Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right is exercised. To the extent that the consideration paid in any such transaction described above consists all or in part of securities or other noncash consideration, the value of such securities or other noncash consideration will be determined by the Committee.

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may, in the event of serious misconduct by a participant (including, without limitation, any misconduct prejudicial to or in conflict with the Company or its Affiliates, or any Termination of Employment for Cause), or any activity of a participant in competition with the business of the Company or any Affiliate, (a) cancel any outstanding Award granted to such participant, in whole or in part, whether or not vested , and/or (b) if such conduct or activity occurs within one year following the exercise or payment of an Award, require such participant to repay to the Company any gain realized or payment received upon the exercise or payment of such Award (with such gain or payment valued as of the date of exercise or payment). In the event the Company's financial statements are restated as a result of errors, omissions or fraud, the Committee may, in good faith and to the extent an Award exceeds what would otherwise have been awarded based on the restated financial results, (a) cancel any outstanding Award granted, in whole or in part, whether or not vested or deferred, to officers of the Company who are identified as being subject to Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Section 16 Officers), and/or (b) if such restatement occurs after the exercise or payment of such Award, require such Section 16 Officer to repay to the Company any gain realized or payment received upon the exercise or payment of such Award (with such gain or payment valued as of the date of exercise or payment).Such cancellation or repayment obligation will be effective as of the date specified by the Committee. Any repayment obligation may be satisfied in Common Stock or cash or a combination thereof (based upon the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the day of payment), and the Committee may provide for an offset to any future payments owed by the Company or any Affiliate to the participant if necessary to satisfy the repayment obligation. The determination of whether a participant has engaged in a serious breach of conduct or any activity in competition with the business of the Company or any Affiliate will be made by the Committee in good faith. This Section 16 will have no application following a Change in Control.
SECTION 16.
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
The Committee may amend, alter, or discontinue the Plan or any Award, prospectively or retroactively, but no amendment, alteration or discontinuation may impair the rights of a recipient of any Award without the recipient's consent, except such an amendment made to comply with applicable law, stock exchange rules or accounting rules.
No amendment will be made without the approval of the Company's stockholders to the extent such approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or, to the extent such amendment increases the number of shares available for delivery under the Plan, or changes the option price after the Grant Date.
No award of Performance Units, Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units may be granted to Non-Employee Directors under Section 14.1 of this Plan after February 16, 2011 or if later, the date that is ten years from the date a majority of the stockholders of the Company approve the most version of the Plan.
SECTION 17.
UNFUNDED STATUS OF PLAN
It is presently intended that the Plan constitutes an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation. The Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Common Stock or make payments; provided, however, that unless the Committee otherwise determines, the existence of such trusts or other arrangements will be consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan.
SECTION 18.
GENERAL PLAN PROVISIONS
The Plan will be administered in accordance with the following provisions and any other rule, guideline and practice determined by the Committee:
19.1
General Provisions
.
The Plan will not constitute a contract of employment, and adoption of the Plan will not confer upon any employee any right to continued employment, nor will it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate at any time the employment of any employee or the membership of any director on a board of directors or any consulting arrangement with any Eligible Individual.
19.2
Employment
.
No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of the participant for federal income tax purposes with respect to any Award under the Plan, the participant will pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, any federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such amount. Unless otherwise determined by the Company, withholding obligations may be settled with Common Stock, including Common Stock that is part of the Award that gives rise to the withholding requirement; provided that not more than the legally required minimum withholding may be settled with Common Stock. The obligations of the Company under the Plan will be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company and its Affiliates will, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the participant. The Committee may establish such procedures as it deems appropriate, including making irrevocable elections, for the settlement of withholding obligations with Common Stock.
19.3
Tax Withholding Obligations
.
The Committee will establish such procedures as it deems appropriate for a participant to designate a beneficiary to whom any amounts payable in the event of the participant's death are to be paid or by whom any rights of the participant, after the participant's death, may be exercised.
19.4
Beneficiaries
.
The Plan and all Awards made and actions taken thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to principles of conflict of laws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event an Award is granted to Eligible Individual who is employed or providing services outside the United States and who is not compensated from a payroll maintained in the United States, the Committee may modify the provisions of the Plan and/or any such Award as they pertain to such individual to comply with and account for the tax and accounting rules of the applicable foreign law so as to maintain the benefit intended to be provided to such participant under the Award.
19.5
Governing Law
.
Except for Section 14 of the Plan, the Plan is not intended to provide for the "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code and, as a result, the Plan (except for Section 14) is not intended to be subject to 409A of the Code. The Plan (except for Section 14) shall, as a result, be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent. Section 14 of the Plan is intended, in part, to provide for the "deferral of compensation" under 409A of the Code and, as a result, is intended to be subject to 409A of the Code. Section 14 of the Plan shall therefore be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.
19.6
409A
.
. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9 and Section 10 , or by the Committee, Awards under the Plan are not transferable except by will or by laws of descent and distribution.
19.7
Nontransferability
Stock Options
Stock Appreciation Rights
Wherever possible, each provision of the Plan and of each Award and of each Notice will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. If any provision of the Plan, any Award or any Notice is found to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, then (a) such provision will be deemed amended to and to have contained from the outset such language as will be necessary to accomplish the objectives of the provision as originally written to the fullest extent permitted by law; and (b) all other provisions of the Plan and any Award will remain in full force and effect.
19.8
Severability
.
No rule of strict construction will be applied against the Company, the Committee or any other person in the interpretation of the terms of the Plan, any Award, any Notice, any other agreement or any rule or procedure established by the Committee.
19.9
Strict Construction
.
Except as otherwise provided herein, no participant will have dividend, voting or other stockholder rights by reason of a grant of an Award or a settlement of an Award in cash.
