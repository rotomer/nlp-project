 FMC Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:FTI) today reported first quarter 2008 revenue of $1.3 billion, up 32 percent over the first quarter of 2007 with the growth coming from each of its four reporting segments. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.62, up 38 percent from $0.45 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
HOUSTON, April 28, 2008
The diluted earnings per share of $0.62 for the first quarter included a $0.01 per share charge associated with the intended spin-off of the FoodTech and Airport Systems businesses and a $0.06 per share charge associated with non-cash mark-to-market charges for foreign currency contracts.
In the first quarter, inbound orders for the company totaled $1.4 billion, of which $1.2 billion was in Energy Systems. Backlog reached a record $5.0 billion, including a record $4.6 billion in Energy Systems.
Operating profit in Energy Systems was strong, up 53 percent in Energy Production Systems and up 30 percent in Energy Processing Systems from the first quarter of 2007.
"We are very pleased with our results from the first quarter," said Peter D. Kinnear, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We increased our Energy Systems backlog to a record $4.6 billion, while improving operating margins in both Energy Systems segments. We are increasing our full-year estimate of 2008 diluted earnings per share to a range of $2.80 to $2.90 including FoodTech and Airport Systems, but excluding costs associated with the planned spin-off."
 
Energy Production Systems
Energy Production Systems' first quarter revenue of $854.0 million increased 40 percent over the prior-year quarter due mainly to increased subsea systems sales. Revenue for subsea systems was a record $699 million for the quarter, up 47 percent from the prior-year quarter. Surface wellhead revenue also increased from the prior-year quarter.
Energy Production Systems' operating profit of $95.0 million increased 53 percent over the prior-year quarter. The increase was mainly due to the higher volume and operating margin in subsea systems. Operating margin in the segment reached 11.1 percent in the quarter.
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders were $913.1 million for the first quarter including $694 million in subsea systems. Backlog of $4.2 billion was up 84 percent from the prior-year quarter and included $3.9 billion in subsea backlog.
Energy Processing Systems
Energy Processing Systems' first quarter revenue of $203.9 million was 18 percent higher than the prior-year quarter. Each business in the segment recorded revenue improvements over the prior-year quarter mostly on higher volume of oil and gas infrastructure products.
Energy Processing Systems' first quarter operating profit of $39.2 million was 30 percent higher than the prior-year quarter. The improvement was the result of higher volume and higher overall operating margins.
Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were $257.8 million for the first quarter, up 29 percent from the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a large order in the material handling systems business related to a new coal-fired power generation project. Backlog was $384.5 million, up 16 percent from the prior-year quarter.
FoodTech
FoodTech's revenue of $147.2 million in the first quarter was up 21 percent from the prior-year quarter. Operating profit of $13.1 million was up 35 percent from the prior-year quarter due to the higher volume.
Inbound orders totaled $148.9 million in the quarter. Backlog was $166.0 million, down 10 percent from the prior-year quarter.
 
Airport Systems
Airport Systems' first quarter revenue of $107.6 million was up 48 percent compared to the first quarter of 2007 due to higher volume of ground support equipment. Airport Systems' first quarter operating profit of $7.6 million was up 145 percent from the prior-year quarter due to the higher volume.
Inbound orders totaled $86.7 million in the quarter. Backlog was $205.9 million, up 18 percent from the prior-year quarter.
Corporate Items
Corporate expense in the first quarter of 2008 was $8.9 million, $1.0 million above the prior-year quarter.
Other expense, net, of $26.2 million increased $22.7 million from the first quarter of 2007. The company incurred $2.7 million in expenses in the quarter associated with its efforts to spin-off its FoodTech and Airport Systems businesses. The company intends to file a Form 10 with the SEC in the second quarter and expects the spin-off to occur in mid-2008. During the quarter, the company also incurred a non-cash, mark-to-market loss on foreign currency forward contracts of $13.5 million compared to a gain in the prior-year quarter of $4.0 million. It is expected that the foreign currency forward contracts will be held to maturity and that the loss will reverse over the term of the contracts.
The company ended the quarter in a net cash position due in part to lower working capital. Consequently, net interest expense in the first quarter of 2008 was down $1.9 million from the prior-year quarter.
In the quarter, the company repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $88.8 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter of 2008 was $21.7 million, up from $19.4 million in the prior-year quarter.
Capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2008 totaled $47.1 million, up from $29.8 million in the prior-year quarter due mainly to investment in subsea intervention assets.
The company recorded an income tax rate of 32.2 percent for continuing operations in the first quarter.
