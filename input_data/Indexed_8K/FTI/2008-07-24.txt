 FMC Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:FTI) today reported second quarter 2008 revenue of $1.5 billion, up 27 percent over the second quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.81, up 47 percent from $0.55 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.
HOUSTON, July 24, 2008
The diluted earnings per share of $0.81 for the second quarter included a $0.04 per share charge associated with the planned spin-off of JBT Corporation (JBT) and a $0.05 per share gain associated with the non-cash mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts. JBT, which is comprised of the FoodTech and Airport Systems businesses, is planned to be spun-off to FTI shareholders on July 31, 2008 after market close.
In the quarter, inbound orders for the company totaled $1.4 billion, of which $1.2 billion was in Energy Systems. Backlog was $5.0 billion, including $4.6 billion in Energy Systems.
Operating profit in Energy Systems was strong, up 50 percent in Energy Production Systems and up 23 percent in Energy Processing Systems from the second quarter of 2007.
"We are very pleased with our second quarter results and with the progression of the JBT spin-off," said Peter D. Kinnear, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are increasing our full-year estimate of 2008 FTI diluted earnings per share, excluding JBT, by $0.20 to a range of $2.60 to $2.70. Our new guidance projects year-over-year growth of approximately 36% over the 2007 pro forma diluted earnings of $1.95 per share excluding JBT."
Energy Production Systems
Energy Production Systems' second quarter revenue of $947.7 million increased 31 percent over the prior-year quarter due mainly to increased subsea systems sales. Revenue for subsea systems was a record $779 million for the quarter, up 35 percent from the prior-year quarter. Surface wellhead revenue was up over 20 percent from the prior-year quarter.
Energy Production Systems' operating profit of $104.9 million increased 50 percent over the prior-year quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher volume and operating margin in subsea systems. Operating margin in the segment was 11.1 percent for the quarter.
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders were $987.3 million for the second quarter including $794 million in subsea systems. Backlog of $4.3 billion was up 60 percent from the prior-year quarter and included $3.9 billion in subsea backlog.
Energy Processing Systems
Energy Processing Systems' second quarter revenue of $220.8 million was 20 percent higher than the prior-year quarter. Each business in the segment recorded revenue improvements over the prior-year quarter mostly on higher volume of oil and gas infrastructure products.
Energy Processing Systems' second quarter operating profit of $42.9 million was 23 percent higher than the prior-year quarter. The improvement was due to the higher volume.
Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were $203.5 million for the second quarter. Backlog was $367.2 million, up nine percent from the prior-year quarter.
FoodTech
FoodTech's revenue of $159.9 million in the second quarter was up four percent from the prior-year quarter. Operating profit of $15.9 million was up 27 percent from the prior-year quarter due to higher operating margins. Inbound orders totaled $147.1 million in the quarter. Backlog was $153.2 million, down 12 percent from the prior-year quarter.
 
Airport Systems
Airport Systems' second quarter revenue of $117.1 million was up 37 percent compared to the second quarter of 2007 due to higher volume of ground support equipment.

Backlog was $187.6 million, down 15 percent from the prior-year quarter.

Corporate Items
Corporate expense in the second quarter of 2008 was $9.9 million, $0.9 million above the prior-year quarter.
During the quarter, the company incurred $5.5 million in expenses, or $0.04 per share, associated with the efforts to spin-off its FoodTech and Airport Systems businesses. Of the $5.5 million, $0.3 million was in corporate staff expense and $5.2 million was in other expense, net.
Other expense, net, of $6.0 million increased $2.1 million from the second quarter of 2007. The company also incurred a non-cash, mark-to-market gain on foreign currency forward contracts of $11.2 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to a gain in the prior-year quarter of $5.2 million. It is expected that the foreign currency forward contracts will be held to maturity and that the mark-to-market gains and losses will reverse over the life of the contracts netting to zero upon maturity.
The company ended the quarter with net debt of $48.2 million. Net interest income was $0.1 million in the second quarter as compared to a $3.7 million net interest expense in the second quarter of 2007.
In the quarter, the company repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for $81 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter of 2008 was $24.0 million, up from $20.9 million in the prior-year quarter.
Capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2008 totaled $43.4 million, up from $41.4 million in the prior-year quarter due mainly to investment in subsea intervention assets.
 
The company recorded an income tax rate of 33.2 percent for continuing operations in the second quarter. The higher than expected tax rate was due to country mix and the limited deductibility of spin-off expenses.
Summary and Outlook
FMC Technologies reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.81, up 47 percent from the prior-year quarter. This result included a $0.04 per share charge associated with JBT spin-off costs and a $0.05 per share gain associated with the non-cash mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts.
