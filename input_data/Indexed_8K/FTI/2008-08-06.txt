On July 31, 2008, FMC Technologies, Inc. ("FMC Technologies") and John Bean Technologies Corporation ("JBT Corporation") entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the "Separation Agreement") and a Tax Sharing Agreement (the "Tax Sharing Agreement") in connection with FMC Technologies' spin-off (the "spin-off") of JBT Corporation. The descriptions set forth below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the Separation Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibit 10.1, respectively.
Separation and Distribution Agreement
The Separation Agreement sets forth the agreement between FMC Technologies and JBT Corporation with respect to the principal corporate transactions required to effect JBT Corporation's separation from FMC Technologies; the transfer of certain assets and liabilities required to effect such separation; the distribution of JBT Corporation's shares to FMC Technologies stockholders; JBT Corporation's dividend to FMC Technologies; and other agreements governing the relationship between FMC Technologies and JBT Corporation following the separation.
The Contribution; Allocation of Assets and Liabilities; No Representations and Warranties
The Separation Agreement required FMC Technologies to contribute to JBT Corporation certain business segments and assets to be included in JBT Corporation's business. As a result of the contribution, FMC Technologies will have no interest in JBT Corporation's assets and business and, subject to certain exceptions described below, generally will have no obligation with respect to JBT Corporation's liabilities. Similarly, JBT Corporation will have no interest in the assets of FMC Technologies and generally will have no obligation with respect to the liabilities of FMC Technologies' retained businesses after the distribution.
The Separation Agreement required that, on or before the completion of the spin-off, JBT Corporation would pay a cash dividend to FMC Technologies, adjusted by the value of JBT Corporation's after-tax operating cash flow for the period from and including January 1, 2008 to and including the distribution date. The amount of this dividend that was paid on July 31, 2008 was approximately $150.5 million. This payment is subject to certain potential true-up adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement.
FMC Technologies generally made no representations or warranties as to the assets, businesses or liabilities transferred or assumed as part of the contribution, and generally made the transfers on an "as is, where is" basis, and the respective transferees agreed to bear the economic and legal risks (1) that any conveyance is insufficient to vest in the transferee good and marketable title, free and clear of any security interest, and (2) that any necessary consents or approvals were not obtained or that requirements of laws or judgments were not complied with.
The Distribution
In connection with the spin-off, each FMC Technologies stockholder received 0.216 shares of JBT Corporation's common stock for each share of FMC Technologies' common stock such stockholder owned as of the record date of the spin-off. No fractional shares of JBT Corporation's common stock were distributed in the distribution. FMC Technologies was required by the Separation Agreement to direct the distribution agent to determine, as soon as practicable, the sum of fractional shares of JBT Corporation's common stock that would have been issued in the distribution and sell the nearest number of whole shares equal to such sum in open market transactions or otherwise, in each case at then prevailing trading prices, with the net proceeds to be distributed to the holders of FMC Technologies' common stock entitled to receive such proceeds in lieu of fractional shares.
Indemnification and Survival
FMC Technologies agreed to generally indemnify, defend and hold harmless JBT Corporation, its affiliates, its respective representatives and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing from and against all indemnifiable losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from:
(a) the failure of FMC Technologies:
(i) to pay or otherwise promptly discharge any of FMC Technologies' liabilities, whether such indemnifiable losses relate to events, occurrences or circumstances occurring or existing, or whether such indemnifiable losses are asserted, before or after the distribution; or
(ii) to perform any of its obligations under the Separation Agreement; or
(b) FMC Technologies' business and liabilities, except to the extent such liabilities relate to JBT Corporation's businesses or except as otherwise specifically provided in the Separation Agreement.
JBT Corporation will generally indemnify, defend and hold harmless FMC Technologies, its affiliates, their respective representatives and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing from and against all indemnifiable losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from:
(a) the failure by JBT Corporation:
(i) to pay or otherwise promptly discharge any of JBT Corporation's liabilities (which liabilities shall include all liabilities, whether incurred before or after the spin-off, of JBT Corporation and of the former FoodTech and Airport Systems business segments of FMC Technologies, and whether or not currently owned, used or occupied by FMC Technologies and its subsidiaries or affiliates), whether such indemnifiable losses relate to events, occurrences or circumstances occurring or existing, or whether such indemnifiable losses are asserted, before or after the distribution; or
(ii) to perform any of its obligations under the Separation Agreement; or
(b) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated, in any portion of the registration statement or information statement (or any preliminary or final form thereof or any amendment thereto) to be filed with the SEC, or necessary to make any assertions in the registration statement or information statement not misleading.
All covenants and agreements of the parties contained in the Separation Agreement will survive the contribution, separation and distribution, and will survive the sale or other transfer by any party or its respective subsidiaries of any assets or businesses or the assignment by it of any liabilities. Additionally, indemnity and contribution provisions contained in the Separation Agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnitee; (ii) the knowledge by the indemnitee of indemnifiable losses for which it might be entitled to indemnification or contribution hereunder; or (iii) any termination of the Separation Agreement.
Tax Sharing Agreement
The Tax Sharing Agreement sets forth the responsibilities of FMC Technologies and JBT Corporation with respect to, among other things, liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign taxes for periods before and including the spin-off, the preparation and filing of tax returns for such periods and disputes with taxing authorities regarding taxes for such periods. FMC Technologies will generally be responsible for the filing of tax returns and the payment of JBT Corporation's federal, state, local and foreign income taxes for periods before and including the spin-off. JBT Corporation will generally be responsible for making payments to FMC Technologies for income tax liabilities with respect to such periods to the extent such income tax liabilities are attributable to taxable income generated by JBT Corporation's operations, after adjustment for any losses, credits, or other tax attributes generated by JBT Corporation's operations in such periods. JBT Corporation will generally be responsible for the payment of all other taxes relating to JBT Corporation's business. FMC Technologies will generally be responsible for managing disputes with taxing authorities that relate to liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes for such periods. However, under the agreement, JBT Corporation will have rights to control and contest certain audit or tax proceedings that relate to income taxes for which JBT Corporation is responsible. Under certain circumstances, FMC Technologies and JBT Corporation may jointly control disputes relating to income taxes for which both parties are responsible. JBT Corporation will generally be responsible for managing disputes relating to all other taxes for which JBT Corporation is responsible. The Tax Sharing Agreement also provides that JBT Corporation will have to indemnify FMC Technologies for some or all of the taxes resulting from the transactions related to the distribution
 
of JBT Corporation's common stock if JBT Corporation takes certain actions which ultimately result in disqualifying the distribution as tax-free under Sections 355 and 368 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"). The Tax Sharing Agreement also requires FMC Technologies to indemnify JBT Corporation against any liability for tax if FMC Technologies' actions cause the disqualification of the spin-off as tax-free under the Code.
To maintain the qualification of the distribution as tax-free under sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, there are material limitations on transactions in which JBT Corporation may be involved during the two-year period following the distribution date. Specifically, during this two-year period, JBT Corporation agrees in the Tax Sharing Agreement to refrain from engaging in any of the transactions listed below unless it first obtains a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or an opinion reasonably acceptable in substance to FMC Technologies from a tax advisor reasonably acceptable to FMC Technologies providing that the transaction will not affect the tax-free treatment of the distribution.
JBT Corporation is restricted from entering into any negotiations, agreements, understandings, or arrangements with respect to transactions or events that may cause the spin-off to be treated as part of a plan pursuant to which one or more persons acquire (other than pursuant to the spin-off) directly or indirectly JBT Corporation's stock representing a "50-percent or greater interest" therein within the meaning of Section 355(d)(4) of the Code, including stock issuances pursuant to the exercise of options, lapsing of restrictions on restricted stock or option grants (excluding option grants made pursuant to compensatory equity incentive arrangements satisfying specified conditions and stock issuances made pursuant to the exercise of options or the lapse of restrictions on stock granted under any such arrangement), capital contributions or acquisitions, entering into any partnership or joint venture arrangements or a series of such transactions or events, and any of the following:
 
 
 
 
If JBT Corporation enters into any of these transactions, with or without the required private letter ruling or opinion from tax counsel, JBT Corporation will be responsible for, and will indemnify FMC Technologies from and against, any tax liability resulting from any such transaction, under terms reasonably acceptable to FMC Technologies, including, in certain circumstances, the posting of an acceptable letter of credit or other security.
 
On July 31, 2008, FMC Technologies completed the spin-off of its wholly owned subsidiary, JBT Corporation, which was accomplished through a special dividend of all outstanding shares of JBT Corporation to FMC Technologies shareholders. Holders of FMC Technologies' common stock of record at the close of business on July 22, 2008 received a dividend of 0.216 shares of JBT Corporation's common stock for each share of FMC Technologies' common stock that they owned. As a result of the spin-off, JBT Corporation is no longer owned by FMC Technologies and is now an independent public company. Shares of JBT Corporation's common stock began trading on a when-issued basis on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on July 18, 2008, and began trading "regular way" on the NYSE on August 1, 2008 under the symbol "JBT."
A copy of the press release announcing the completion of the spin-off is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(b) Effective July 31, 2008 upon the spin-off, Charles H. Cannon, Jr. resigned from his position as FMC Technologies' Senior Vice President to dedicate himself solely to his position as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of JBT Corporation. Also effective July 31, 2008 upon the spin-off, Ronald D. Mambu resigned from his position as FMC Technologies' Vice President and Controller to dedicate himself solely to his position as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Controller of JBT Corporation.
(c) On July 31, 2008, FMC Technologies announced that Jay A. Nutt would become FMC Technologies' Controller effective August 1, 2008. Mr. Nutt, 45, has been Assistant Controller of FMC Technologies since January 2008. Prior to that time, he was the Controller of FMC Technologies' Energy Systems division since 2007, and was the Division Controller of FMC Technologies' Energy Production Systems division since the 2001 spin-off of FMC Technologies from FMC Corporation. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(b) Pro Forma Financial Information

Contribution
(a) On or prior to the Assumption Time, Parent shall assign and transfer to a member of the Spinco Group to be selected by Spinco, all of Parent's and its subsidiaries' respective rights, title and interests in all Spinco Assets except as otherwise specified in this Agreement.

(i) . The Spinco Assets (other than Intellectual Property Rights, which will be licensed or assigned only as set forth in ) shall, to the extent reasonably practicable (including taking into account the costs of any actions taken), be separated from the Parent Assets so that members of the Spinco Group will own and control the Spinco Assets at the Assumption Time and members of the Parent Group will own and control the Parent Assets at the Assumption Time. Such separation shall be effected in a manner that does not unreasonably disrupt either the Spinco Business or the Parent Business and minimizes, to the extent practicable, current and future costs (and losses of Tax or other economic benefits) of the respective businesses. With respect to any Asset that cannot reasonably be separated or otherwise allocated as provided above (A) all right, title and interest of the Parent Group shall be allocated to the party as to which such Asset is primarily used or held for use or primarily relates and (B) the other party shall have a right to use such Asset in its business in a manner consistent with past practice for a period which is coterminous with the life of the Asset described in (A) (and the obligation to pay its allocable share of any costs or expenses related to such Asset based on the methodology historically used by Parent); that if any Ancillary Agreement provides a more specific allocation or methodology with respect to any such Asset, the more specific treatment provided in the Ancillary Agreement shall prevail. To the extent the separation of Assets cannot be achieved in a reasonably practicable manner, the parties will enter into appropriate arrangements regarding such shared Asset.

Transfers Not Effected Prior to the Separation; Transfers Deemed Effective at the Assumption Time
To the extent that any transfers contemplated by this shall not have been completed at the Assumption Time, the parties shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to effect such transfers as promptly following the Assumption Time as shall be practicable. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require the transfer of any Assets or the assumption of any Liabilities which by their terms or operation of law cannot be transferred or assumed; , , that Parent and Spinco shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consents or approvals for the transfer of all Assets and Liabilities contemplated to be transferred pursuant to this . In the event that any such transfer of Assets or Liabilities has not been completed effective as of and after the Assumption Time, the party retaining such Asset or Liability shall thereafter hold such Asset for the use and benefit of the party entitled thereto (at the expense of the party entitled thereto) and retain such Liability for the account of the party by whom such Liability is to be assumed pursuant hereto, and take such other action as may be reasonably requested by the party to which such Asset is to be transferred, or by whom such Liability is to be assumed, as the case may be, in order to place such party, insofar as reasonably possible, in the same position as would have existed had such Asset or Liability been transferred as contemplated by this Agreement. As and when any such Asset or Liability becomes transferable, such transfer shall be effected promptly. The parties agree that, at the Assumption Time, each Party shall be deemed to have acquired complete and sole beneficial ownership over all of the Assets, together with all rights, powers and privileges incident thereto, and shall be deemed to have assumed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement all of the Liabilities, and all duties, obligations and responsibilities incident thereto, which such party is entitled to acquire or required to assume pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(ii) Spinco and Parent shall jointly determine the Initial Dividend Amount, which amount shall be based on the parties' best estimate of the expected pro forma accounts of the Spinco Business as of the Distribution Date; and
(iii) Spinco shall cause to be paid to Parent an amount equal to the estimate of the Dividend Amount (such amount actually paid to Parent on or before the Distribution Date, the "Initial Dividend Amount").
(b) Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto, for purposes of calculating the Initial Dividend Amount, the Final Dividend Amount and the After Tax Operating Cash Flow of the Spinco Business, those certain one time expenses, restructuring expenses (including tax costs associated with foreign transfers) and deal related costs specified in are to be paid by Parent, including reimbursement to Spinco for any such costs incurred.

(d) Within 60 days after the Distribution Date, Spinco shall determine the final Dividend Amount (such amount, subject to adjustment for any dispute settled as set forth in this Section 2.6(d), the "Final Dividend Amount") and shall deliver to Parent the calculation of the Final Dividend Amount, along with all relevant documents used to determine the Final Dividend Amount. At Parent's reasonable request, Spinco shall promptly deliver or make available to Parent all books and records used or useful in Parent's review of the Final Dividend Amount. Parent shall have 30 days to review the Final Dividend Amount delivered by Spinco, and shall bring any dispute to Spinco's attention by written notice within such 30 day review period. If
 
Parent agrees to the Final Dividend Amount and such amount is less than the Initial Dividend Amount, Parent shall pay the difference to Spinco not later than 10 business days after Parent's written agreement to such amount (or 10 business days after the expiration of the 30-day review period, if earlier). If the Final Dividend Amount is greater than the Initial Dividend Amount, Spinco shall pay the excess to Parent not later than 10 business days after Spinco's delivery of the Final Dividend Amount (provided that Parent shall still have 30 days from the date of its receipt of such books and records to dispute that the Final Dividend Amount should have been greater). In the event of a dispute of the Final Dividend Amount by Parent, Parent shall give notice thereof no later than 30 days after delivery of the certificate of the Final Dividend Amount from Spinco; provided that, if the Final Dividend Amount is less than the Initial Dividend Amount and the Parent agrees with the calculation of that shortfall, then Parent shall pay such undisputed amount to Spinco not later than 10 business days after Parent's written agreement to such amount (or 10 business days after the expiration of the 30-day review period, if earlier). The parties shall cooperate in an effort to resolve any such dispute. If they are unable to resolve any such dispute within 30 days after the expiration of Parent's 30-day review period, either party may submit the matter for resolution to PricewaterhouseCoopers (or if PricewaterhouseCoopers is not willing or able to serve, to Ernst & Young, or if Ernst and Young is not willing or able to serve, to any other nationally recognized independent accounting firm). The decision of such firm shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall thereafter represent the Final Dividend Amount for purposes hereof. Within 5 business days after the earlier of Parent and Spinco mutually agreeing to the Final Dividend Amount or the final determination of the independent accountant, (i) Parent shall pay to Spinco any previously unpaid amount by which the Initial Dividend Amount exceeds the Final Dividend Amount or (ii) Spinco shall pay to Parent any previously unpaid amount by which the Final Dividend Amount exceeds the Initial Dividend Amount. The fees and expenses of the firm shall be borne equally by Parent and Spinco.
SECTION 2.7 .
Pension Asset Transfers
(a) Prior to the date hereof, the FMC Technologies Employees' Retirement Program was applicable to both employees who have become, or will become on the Distribution Date, employees of Spinco or its subsidiaries. Subsequent to June 30, 2008, the JBT Defined Benefit Retirement Trust will bear the allocated assets and liabilities of the employees of Spinco, retirees from Spinco businesses or locations and terminated vested employees from Spinco businesses or locations. The parties hereto agree that the total amount that Parent shall cause to be transferred from the trust funding the FMC Technologies Employees' Retirement Program to the JBT Defined Benefit Retirement Trust will be an amount equal to the portion of the total assets of the FMC Technologies Employees' Retirement Plan that Mercer (who shall be engaged by Parent to make such determination) shall determine is allocable to the JBT Defined Benefit Retirement Trust in accordance with a Section 4044 of ERISA asset allocation of the current FMC Technologies Employees' Retirement Program as of June 30, 2008. This allocation will be completed prior to December, 31, 2008.
Prior to the date hereof, Parent has caused or will cause the FMC Technologies Employees' Retirement Program to transfer to the trustee of the JBT Defined Benefit Retirement Trust an amount in cash equal to $10,000,000. Parent shall cause the trustee of the trust funding the FMC Technologies Employees' Retirement Program to make a subsequent asset transfer to the trustee of the JBT Defined Benefit Retirement Trust prior to December 31, 2008 in an
 
aggregate amount equal to the sum of (a) (i) the Section 4044 asset allocation at June 30, 2008 attributable to the JBT Defined Benefit Retirement Trust as determined by Mercer, (ii) $10,000,000, and (b) (i) the investment performance gain or loss percentage of the FMC Technologies Employees' Retirement Program from June 30, 2008 to the funding date times (ii) the Section 4044 asset allocation at June 30, 2008 attributable to the JBT Defined Benefit Retirement Trust as determined by Mercer at June 30, 2008 minus $10,000,000. Investment performance will be calculated monthly and compounded, including all investment management fees and asset based trustee fees, excluding contributions and benefit payments. For administrative purposes, the investment performance will be estimated at the funding date and trued up to actual performance within 30 days, with the true up payment bearing interest at one-month Treasury bill rates. Parent and Spinco shall cooperate with Mercer as is reasonably requested by it or the other party hereto in order to assist Mercer with its tasks hereunder. Additionally, Parent shall consult with Spinco for all major changes to the investments of the FMC Technologies Employees' Retirement Program during the period from June 30, 2008 to the funding date.
minus
(b) Prior to the Distribution Date, Parent will cause the transfer from the FMC Technologies Employees' Savings and Investment Plan and FMC Technologies Employees' Non-qualified Savings and Investment Plan the liabilities and assets associated with current Spinco employees, retirees from Spinco businesses or locations, and terminated vested former employees from Spinco businesses or locations to the John Bean Technologies Corporation Savings and Investment Plan and the John Bean Technologies Corporation Non-qualified Savings and Investment Plan.
(c) In Brazil, Parent's subsidiary converted its defined benefit retirement plan to a defined contribution plan. All employees were converted to the defined contribution plan with the exception of approximately 22 current and term vested employees. The Brazilian retirement plan will be split between the Parent and Spinco as follows in (i)-(iii).
(i) The vested defined benefit retirement liabilities for all term vested employees will remain with the Parent along with the defined contribution liabilities for employees, terminated vested employees, and retirees associated with the Parent's remaining business. Except for the vested defined benefit retirement plan liabilities retained by the Parent, Spinco will assume the liabilities of employees, terminated vested employees, and retirees associated with Spinco's businesses. Towers Perrin, the plan actuary, will perform an actuarial valuation at June 30, 2008 of the defined benefit and the defined contribution plans. After that valuation, a sufficient amount of assets to provide for payment of the vested defined benefit retirement liability will be allocated to the Parent's plan. These assets will be invested in a manner to match the benefit payments and defined benefit liability. Defined contribution assets associated with the defined contribution plans will be allocated to Parent or Spinco's defined contribution plans based on whether the employee is or was at retirement a Parent or Spinco employee. After the allocation described above and other actuarial adjustments, the actuarial gain or loss from the valuation will be distributed to the Parent and Spinco plans in proportion to the defined contribution and defined benefit liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt, the actuarial valuation gain or loss referenced in this section comes from the calculation on page 18 in the Towers Perrin March 2008 presentation of the actuarial valuation as of June 2007.
 
(ii) Parent will compensate Spinco in the Initial Dividend Amount and Final Dividend Amount by an amount equal to the estimated difference between 50% of the total actuarial gain or loss of the combined plans and the amount of actuarial gain or loss estimated to remain in the Parent's plan multiplied by 1 minus the applicable Brazilian tax rate. For purposes of the estimation, the difference between 50% of the total actuarial gain or loss and the amount of actuarial gain or loss estimated to remain in the Parent's plan will be $702,632 ( Brazilian Reais 1,147,750@ 1.6335 Brazilian Reais/$). This portion of the Initial Dividend Amount and Final Dividend Amount will be adjusted to actual after the completion of the June 30, 2008 actuarial valuation but not later than December 30, 2008 based on the actual difference between 50% of the total actuarial gain or loss and the amount of actuarial gain or loss remaining in the Parent's Plan times 1 minus the applicable Brazilian tax rate.
(iii) Spinco agrees to indemnify Parent for ten (10) years for 50% of any change in the difference between actuarial liability associated with the retained defined benefit retirement liability and the assets invested to match that liability. Every two years Parent's actuary will furnish Spinco an annual report in reasonable detail showing both the components and change in the retained defined benefit retirement liabilities and invested matched assets. Within 30 days of the report, Spinco will make indemnifying payments to Parent such that the indemnifying amount will equal 50% of the shortfall in matched asset market values from the actuarial liability. Parent will cause Parent's Brazilian subsidiary to contribute 100% of the identified shortfall to the Brazilian retirement plan within 30 days of the Spinco payment. No indemnification payment will be due if assets in the matched asset account are greater than the actuarial liability.
SECTION 2.8 .
Foreign Exchange Forward Instruments
Parent and Spinco agree that certain foreign exchange forward instruments related to the Spinco Business may not be assigned to Spinco due to counterparty constraints. Within 60 days after the Distribution Date Parent shall terminate the instruments not assigned to Spinco in such a manner that Spinco may replace the instruments contemporaneously with their selected financial institutions. Parent shall transfer to Spinco all cash proceeds as a result of the termination of the instruments and pay to Spinco within 10 business days of cash receipt. If Parent is required to submit cash proceeds to the institutions those amounts will be communicated to Spinco and Spinco shall pay to Parent within 10 businesses days.

(b) No fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock shall be distributed in the Distribution. Parent shall direct the distribution agent to determine, as soon as practicable, the sum of fractional shares of Spinco Common Stock that would have been issued in the Distribution and sell the nearest number of whole shares equal to such sum in open market transactions or otherwise, in each case at then prevailing trading prices. The distribution agent shall then cause to be distributed to the holders of Parent Common Stock entitled to receive such proceeds in lieu of fractional shares an amount in cash equal to such holder's ratable share of the proceeds of such sale, without interest, after making appropriate deductions of the amount required to be withheld for federal income tax purposes and after deducting an amount equal to all brokerage charges, commissions and transfer taxes attributed to such sale.

SECTION 4.3 .
Procedures for Indemnification for Third-Party Actions
(a) Parent or Spinco, as applicable, shall notify the other in writing promptly after learning of any third-party Action for which any indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from the other under this Agreement. The failure of any indemnitee to give such notice shall not relieve any indemnifying party of its obligations under this except to the extent that such indemnifying party or its affiliate is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such notice shall describe such third-party Action in reasonable detail considering the information provided to the indemnitee.
Article IV
(b) An indemnifying party may, by notice to the indemnitee and to Parent, if Spinco is the indemnifying party, or to the indemnitee and Spinco, if Parent is the indemnifying party, within 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of such indemnitee's notice of a third-party Action (or sooner, if the nature of such third-party Action so requires), undertake the defense or settlement of such third-party Action. The indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of a third-party Action (i) seeking material non-monetary remedies (such
 
as criminal or material injunctive relief) or (ii) for which the indemnitee reasonably determines that the indemnifying party and the indemnitee have different legal defenses available which make it inappropriate for the indemnifying party to assume such defense, and in each case such third-party Actions may be defended by the indemnitee at the indemnifying party's expense; that the indemnitee shall use reasonable efforts to keep the indemnifying party apprised of the status of such matter(s) (provided that the failure to do so shall not affect the amount owed by the indemnifying party with respect to such third-party Action). If an indemnifying party undertakes the defense of any third-party Action, such indemnifying party shall thereby admit its obligation to indemnify the indemnitee against such third-party Action, and such indemnifying party shall control the investigation and defense or settlement thereof, and the indemnitee may not settle or compromise such third-party Action, except that such indemnifying party shall not (x) require any indemnitee, without its prior written consent, to take or refrain from taking any action in connection with such third-party Action, or make any public statement, which such indemnitee reasonably considers to be against its interests, or (y) without the prior written consent of the indemnitee and of Parent, if the indemnitee is a Parent Indemnitee, or the indemnitee and of Spinco, if the Indemnitee is a Spinco Indemnitee, consent to any settlement that does not include as a part thereof an unconditional release of the indemnitees from liability with respect to such third-party Action or that requires the indemnitee or any of its Representatives or affiliates to make any payment that is not fully indemnified under this Agreement or to be subject to any non-monetary remedy. Subject to the indemnifying party's control rights, the indemnitees may, at its expense, participate in the investigation and defense of any third-party Action assumed by the indemnifying party. Following the provision of notices to the indemnifying party, until such time as an indemnifying party has undertaken the defense of any third-party Action as provided in this Agreement, such indemnitee shall control the investigation and defense or settlement thereof at the cost and expense of the indemnifying party, without prejudice to its right to seek indemnification hereunder.
provided
(c) In no event shall an indemnifying party be liable for the costs, fees and expenses of more than one law firm for all indemnitees (in addition to its own counsel, if any) in connection with any one action, or separate but similar or related actions, in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.
(d) Spinco and Parent shall make available to each other, their counsel and other Representatives, all information and documents reasonably available to them which relate to any third-party Action, and otherwise cooperate as may reasonably be required in connection with the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement. Any joint defense agreement entered into by Spinco or Parent with any third party relating to any third-party Action shall provide that Spinco or Parent may, if requested, provide information obtained through any such agreement to the Spinco Indemnitees and/or the Parent Indemnitees.
(e) The provisions of (other than this ) and shall not apply to Taxes (which are covered by the Tax Sharing Agreement).

Such indemnifying party may, within 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of such indemnitee's notice of such claim (or sooner, if the nature of such claim so requires), undertake the defense or settlement of such claim. If such indemnifying party does not respond within such 30-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
(b) In the event of payment by or on behalf of any indemnifying party to or on behalf of any indemnitee in connection with any third-party Action, such indemnifying party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such third-party Action against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such third-party Action or against any other person. Such indemnitee shall cooperate with such indemnifying party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense (including allocated costs of in-house counsel and other personnel) of such indemnifying party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.
SECTION 4.5 .
Survival of Indemnities
(a) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article IV shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnitee; (ii) the knowledge by the indemnitee of Indemnifiable Losses for which it might be entitled to indemnification or contribution hereunder; or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.13 .
Joint Defense Cost Sharing Agreement
Spinco hereby acknowledges and agrees that it has received a copy of the joint defense agreement between Parent and FMC Corporation, dated April 1, 2003, pursuant to which Parent and FMC Corporation agreed to the joint defense of certain matters (including mass tort litigation where both such entities are named as defendants). Spinco and Parent hereby agree that, beginning on the Distribution Date, Spinco shall promptly (and in any event within 10 business days after notice of such costs) reimburse and pay to Parent twenty percent (20%) of Parent's portion of the legal fees and other costs incurred by Parent in connection with the joint defense agreement between Parent and FMC Corporation, dated April 1, 2003. Parent shall provide Spinco with access to all information related to the administration of the joint defense agreement between Parent and FMC Corporation, dated April 1, 2003, including access to the records maintained in the Parent's matter management system related to such joint defense agreement.
 
SECTION 9.14 .
Insurance Sharing
(a) For all policies incepted on or after the Distribution Date, Parent and Spinco shall be completely responsible for managing all aspects of its own claims, at its own expense, including formal notification to insurers, interacting with insurance brokers, making payments to third-party administrators and shall in general make its own decisions regarding settlement of claims based on its own business judgment. However, for all claims related to or covered by insurance policies bound prior to the Distribution Date, the FMC Risk Management Department shall have the responsibility of formal notification to insurers and Parent and Spinco shall be responsible to coordinate its legal position with the other party and seek to avoid legal positions that may be in conflict with the legal position of the other party. To the extent a conflict in position cannot be avoided after discussion between the Parties, the issue shall be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution procedure required by Article X of this Agreement.
(b) Responsibility for claims management and/or indemnity obligations, and any related claim for insurance coverage, shall belong to the party associated with the loss, except where the other party has assumed responsibility for that specific liability or type of liability in this Agreement or any schedule or exhibit hereto, in which case such responsibility and obligations shall belong to such other party. Neither this provision nor any other aspect of this Section 9.14 is intended to increase: (a) the burden on or the financial exposure to the insurers under the subject policies or (b) the benefits to the parties under those policies. Instead, it is the intent of Parent and Spinco to reflect the reality of which each such party is financially responsible for the alleged liability resulting from the subject claim(s) and to provide that the insurance benefits applicable to the claim(s) are available to the financially responsible party.
(c) If Spinco submits a claim under a policy in effect prior to the Distribution Date which is rejected in whole or in part by an insurer because Spinco is not a named insured on the policy, and if it is determined by Spinco and Parent that the claim would otherwise be covered if that claim were assumed and submitted by Parent, and to the extent such claim is payable and paid by insurance, then to that extent, Parent shall re-assume responsibility (only to the extent insurance proceeds are actually recovered) for that claim and present it to the insurer in its own name. In such event, Spinco shall, on an on-going monthly basis, hold harmless and indemnity Parent for all loss, cost and expense not covered by insurance. In such event, the re-assumed claim and any payment received from an insurer, shall be treated as belonging to Spinco.
(d) Where a third party presents a claim against both Parent and Spinco in error ("Third Party Error") and it is jointly agreed by the Parent and Spinco that only one Parent or Spinco should be involved, the involved party shall be responsible for claim management and promptly take all necessary actions to have the uninvolved party dismissed from the claim. To the extent Parent and Spinco are unable to agree on whether a claim represents a Third Party Error, the issue shall be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution procedure required by Article X of this Agreement. Third Party Errors shall be deemed to include any action or claim against a party who, as between Parent and Spinco, is not responsible for such action or claim by operation of this Agreement, even though the party may be potentially responsible to the third party by operation of law.
 
(e) Regarding policies in effect at the Distribution Date, Parent and Spinco agree to waive subrogation against the other party following the settlement or other resolution of any action which involves such insurance policy. In addition, Parent agrees that Spinco should be deemed and treated as an insured entitled to benefits under such policies based upon its historical business and activities covered under those policies when part of Parent, but only to the extent such policy is an occurrence-based policy.
(f) Parent and Spinco shall bear the cost of the applicable per occurrence deductible or self-insured retention as their claims occur. The burden created by the insolvency of any insurer in any layer of insurance shall be borne by the party or parties (on a pro rata basis) that incurred the loss and which resulted in the inability to collect the insurance because of insolvency of the insurer. For example, if both Parent and Spinco had claims that should have been covered by a layer of insurance, the lack of recovery would be split based on the relative losses incurred by Parent and Spinco in that layer. If only one of Parent or Spinco incurs losses that are not recoverable, that party shall bear the loss. If one of Parent or Spinco collects on a claim for a layer of insurance, the carrier becomes insolvent and then the other party incurs a claim, the insurance recoveries of the party that had recovered insurance proceeds will be shared pro rata (based on relative losses suffered within such layer of insurance by Parent and Spinco) with the other party.
(g) If both Parent and Spinco losses exceed an aggregate deductible then the insurance recoveries shall be shared by Parent and Spinco on a pro rata basis based on loss claims from each such party.
SECTION 10.1 .
Dispute Resolution
(a) Except for any claims for equitable relief in connection with the failure of any party to perform its covenants hereunder and except with respect to disputes under , in the event of any dispute or disagreement between any member of the Parent Group and any member of the Spinco Group as to the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement (or the performance of obligations hereunder), the parties shall promptly meet in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute. Should such good faith effort fail to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days after first meeting to resolve the dispute and upon the written request of Parent or Spinco, the dispute shall be referred to either the Chief Financial Officers (for matters that are deemed financial in nature) or the Chief Executive Officers (for each other matter) of the parties for decision. If the officers do not agree upon a decision within thirty (30) days after reference of the matter to them, each of Parent and Spinco shall submit any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or the transactions arising hereunder for arbitration in the City of Chicago, Illinois, and such arbitration shall be the sole remedy for such monetary claims. Such arbitration shall be administered by the Center for Public Resources Institute for Dispute Resolutions in accordance with its then prevailing Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of Business Disputes (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement), by an arbitrator or arbitrators as selected and described in . The
Section 2.6(d)
Section 10.1(b)
 
arbitration shall be governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.  1 et seq. The award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and not subject to judicial review and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) For all disputes for which the aggregate disputed dollar amount is equal to or less than $3,000,000, then Parent and Spinco shall agree upon a single arbitrator to oversee the dispute. If Parent and Spinco cannot agree on such arbitrator within 20 days after submitting the dispute for arbitration, then the dispute shall be managed by a single independent arbitrator to be chosen by the Center for Public Resources Institute for Dispute Resolutions. For all disputes for which the aggregate disputed dollar amount exceeds $3,000,000, such dispute shall be managed and ruled upon by a panel of three arbitrators. Parent and Spinco shall each name one of the arbitrators, and the third arbitrator shall be chosen by Parent and Spinco or, if Parent and Spinco cannot agree on such arbitrator within 20 days after submitting the dispute for arbitration, then the third arbitrator shall be an independent arbitrator selected by the Center for Public Resources Institute for Dispute Resolutions.
(c) The fees and expenses of the Center for Public Resources Institute for Dispute Resolution and the arbitrator(s) shall be shared equally by Parent and Spinco.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of the date first above written.

(b) The party (or Affiliate thereof) initially claiming the Tax deduction described in Section 2.11(a) shall withhold applicable Taxes and satisfy applicable Tax reporting obligations with respect to the taxation of the Employee Restricted Stock, Employee Stock Options, or deferred compensation with respect to which the Tax deduction is claimed.
