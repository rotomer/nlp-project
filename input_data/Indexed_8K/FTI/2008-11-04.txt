Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(b) Pro Forma Financial Information
On August 6, 2008, FMC Technologies, Inc. ("FMC Technologies") filed a Form 8-K describing the FMC Technologies' spin-off of John Bean Technologies ("JBT Corporation"). Item 9.01 contained FMC Technologies' required pro forma condensed combined financial information after giving effect to the spin-off of JBT Corporation. Certain reclassifications and adjustments have been made to the pro forma condensed combined financial information reflecting additional financial information obtained subsequent to August 6, 2008. This amendment is filed to reflect the adjusted pro forma condensed combined financial information.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FMC TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Included in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented herein are (i) unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 that give effect to the spin-off of our FoodTech and Airport Systems segments, also known as John Bean Technologies Corporation, as if the spin-off had occurred on January 1, 2005 and (ii) an unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2008 that gives effect to the spin-off of John Bean Technologies Corporation as if the spin-off had occurred on June 30, 2008.
The pro forma adjustments are derived from the best possible information and assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The pro forma adjustments may differ from those that will be calculated to report the FoodTech and Airport Systems segments as a discontinued operation in our future filings.
These unaudited pro forma financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the operating results or the financial position that would have been achieved had the spin-off of John Bean Technologies Corporation been completed as of the dates indicated or of the results that may be obtained in the future. These unaudited pro forma financial statements and the accompanying notes should be read together with (i) the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and (ii) the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
