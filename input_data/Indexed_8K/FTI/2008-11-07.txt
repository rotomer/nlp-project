The spin-off of JBT Corporation was completed on July 31, 2008. An 8-K/A was filed on November 4, 2008 that updated pro forma financials.
"We are very pleased with the growth of revenues and profits in our third quarter results," said Peter D. Kinnear, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "We are reaffirming diluted earnings per share guidance for 2008 in a range of $2.60 to $2.70. Our guidance projects growth of approximately 36 percent over the 2007 diluted earnings from continuing operations."
 
Energy Production Systems
Energy Production Systems' third quarter revenue of $896.2 million increased 31 percent over the prior-year quarter due mainly to increased subsea systems sales. Revenue for subsea systems was $722 million for the quarter, up 38 percent from the prior-year quarter. Surface wellhead revenue was up 15 percent from the third quarter of 2007.
Energy Production Systems' operating profit of $101.6 million increased 44 percent over the prior-year quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher volume and operating margin in subsea systems. Operating margin in the segment was 11.3 percent for the quarter.
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders were $551.3 million for the third quarter. The year-to-date subsea systems inbound orders are now $1.9 billion. Backlog was $3.9 billion and included $3.6 billion in subsea backlog at the end of the third quarter.
Energy Processing Systems
Energy Processing Systems' third quarter revenue of $229.0 million was 15 percent higher than the prior-year quarter. The revenue increase was driven by the Measurement Solutions and Material Handling Systems businesses.
Energy Processing Systems' third quarter operating profit of $42.7 million was 12 percent higher than the prior-year quarter. This improvement was led by the Measurement Solutions and Material Handling businesses.
Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were $237.2 million for the third quarter and backlog was $375.4 million.

The company ended the quarter with net debt of $69.0 million. Net interest expense was $0.9 million in the third quarter as compared to a $3.3 million net interest expense in the third quarter of 2007. The lower interest was the result of lower average debt levels in the quarter.

Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter of 2008 was $20.0 million, up from $15.4 million in the prior-year quarter.
Capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2008 totaled $39.5 million, down from $45.5 million in the prior-year quarter as the spending for our previously announced subsea capacity additions nears completion.
