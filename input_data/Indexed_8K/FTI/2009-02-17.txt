HOUSTON, February 16, 2009
Fourth quarter operating profit increased 39 percent in Energy Production Systems and was up 4 percent in Energy Processing Systems compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.
The acquisition of a 45 percent interest in Schilling Robotics, LLC was completed on December 26, 2008. Schilling Robotics is a leading manufacturer of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), ROV manipulator systems, and control systems for use in subsea oil and gas exploration and production.
Full Year 2008 Results
Full year 2008 revenue of $4.6 billion increased 25 percent from $3.6 billion in 2007. This growth was led by subsea systems revenue which increased 32 percent to $3.0 billion.
Full year 2008 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.72 were up 39 percent from 2007 diluted earnings per share of $1.95. Energy Production Systems' operating profit increased 46 percent and Energy Processing Systems' operating profit increased 16 percent over the prior year.
"We are very pleased with our results in 2008," said Peter D. Kinnear, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We enter 2009 in the midst of an uncertain macroeconomic environment but with a solid base for future business. We expect the strength of our subsea backlog will help offset declines in our other businesses in 2009. Overall, we estimate 2009 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.65."
Review of Operations  Fourth Quarter 2008
Energy Production Systems
Energy Production Systems' fourth quarter revenue of $972.8 million increased 12 percent over the prior-year quarter due to increased subsea systems sales. Revenue for subsea systems was a record $788 million for the quarter, up 15 percent from the prior-year quarter. Surface wellhead revenue decreased slightly from the fourth quarter of 2007.
Energy Production Systems' record operating profit of $119.1 million increased 39 percent over the prior-year quarter. The increase was due to higher volume and operating margin in subsea systems. Operating margin in the segment was a record 12.2 percent for the quarter and 11.5 percent for the full year.
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders of $401.5 million in the fourth quarter were adversely impacted by backlog translation due mainly to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Norwegian Krone and Brazilian Real. Full-year subsea system orders were $2.1 billion. Backlog for Energy Production Systems was $3.3 billion and included $3.0 billion in subsea backlog at the end of the fourth quarter.
