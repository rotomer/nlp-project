Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 FMC Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:FTI) today reported first quarter 2010 revenue from continuing operations of $1.1 billion. Operating profit from continuing operations was a record $181.0 million. The resulting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.80 as compared to $0.56 in the prior-year quarter.
HOUSTON, April 28, 2010
Led by higher operating margin in subsea systems, first quarter operating profit in Energy Production Systems increased 51 percent from the first quarter of 2009 to a record $157.6 million. Operating profit in Energy Processing Systems was down 18 percent from the prior-year quarter due mainly to lower operating margins in the measurement solutions and material handling systems businesses, partially offset by higher operating margins in the fluid control business.
The total company backlog increased five percent from the fourth quarter of 2009 to $2.7 billion and included $2.1 billion in subsea systems. The backlog increase was the first since the second quarter of 2008 and was mainly driven by $872 million in subsea systems orders, the most since the fourth quarter of 2007.
"Our strong performance in the quarter was due to the composition of our sales as well as operational efficiencies that drove improved project execution," said Peter D. Kinnear, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Given our first quarter results and the efficiencies that we have established, we are increasing our estimate for 2010 diluted earnings per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.90."
 
Energy Production Systems
Energy Production Systems' first quarter revenue of $887.6 million increased two percent from the prior-year quarter. Revenue for subsea systems was $729 million and was also up two percent from the prior-year quarter. Surface wellhead revenue was up slightly from the first quarter of 2009.
Energy Production Systems' record operating profit of $157.6 million increased 51 percent over the prior-year quarter. This increase was due to higher operating margins in subsea systems driven by accelerated progress on higher margin projects and lower costs.
Energy Production Systems' inbound orders for the first quarter were $1.0 billion, including subsea systems orders of $872 million. Backlog for Energy Production Systems was $2.5 billion, including $2.1 billion in subsea systems at the end of the first quarter.
Energy Processing Systems
Energy Processing Systems' first quarter revenue of $167.5 million was seven percent lower than the prior-year quarter. An increase in revenue for the fluid control business was more than offset by decreases in both the material handling systems and loading systems businesses.
Energy Processing Systems' first quarter operating profit of $23.4 million was down 18 percent from the prior-year quarter but was up 14 percent sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily driven by volume leverage in the fluid control business, partially offset by volume decreases in the other businesses within the segment.
Energy Processing Systems' inbound orders were $180.3 million for the first quarter, which was up 19 percent from the prior-year quarter. The increase was mainly driven by the fluid control business, which benefited from the resurgence in North American pressure pumping activity. Backlog for the segment finished the quarter at $229.1 million.
Corporate Items
Corporate expense in the first quarter was $9.0 million, an increase of $2.2 million from the prior-year quarter. Other expense, net, was $20.8 million, a decrease of $4.2 million from the prior-year quarter.
The company ended the first quarter with net debt of $103.8 million. Net interest expense was $2.3 million in the quarter.
 
 
The company repurchased 874 thousand shares of common stock in the quarter for $50.5 million and now has 4.5 million shares remaining in its stock repurchase authorization.
Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $28.6 million, up $0.3 million from the previous quarter, and capital expenditures totaled $19.4 million.
The company recorded an effective tax rate of 33.5 percent for the first quarter.
