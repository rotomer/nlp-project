Explanatory Note
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A (Amendment No. 1) (the "Amendment") amends and supplements the Current Report on Form 8-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 12, 2011. The sole purpose of this Amendment is to disclose our decision regarding how frequently we will conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation paid to our named executive officers.
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
(d) On May 6, 2011, we held our 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At the Annual Meeting, our stockholders were asked to consider and act upon, among other matters, an advisory vote on the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation. As previously reported, a majority of the votes cast on the frequency proposal were cast in favor of holding an advisory vote on executive compensation every year. In consideration of the stockholder vote, our Board of Directors has determined to hold the stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation or until the Board of Directors determines otherwise. We are required to hold advisory votes on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation every six years.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
