The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that the information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing), consists exclusively of the information specified in Section 10 hereof.
Indemnification by the Underwriters
(c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder. Counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected as follows: counsel to the Underwriters and the other indemnified parties referred to in Section 6(a) above shall be selected by the Representatives; and counsel to the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall be selected by the Company. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action;
Actions Against Parties; Notification
 
provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for the Underwriters and the other indemnified parties referred to in Section 6(a) above; and the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, in each case in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each affiliate, officer, director, employee, partner and member of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in hereto and not joint.
Exhibit A
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates signed by any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (whether signed on behalf of such officer, the Company or such subsidiary) and delivered to the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any officer, director, employee, partner, member or agent of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, any officer, director or employee of the Company or any person controlling the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

(10) The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents, the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Securities and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities as described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds") and compliance by the Company with its obligations under the Transaction Documents do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default, Termination Event or Repayment Event under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to any Company Document, except for such conflicts, breaches, defaults or Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Organizational Documents of the Company or any Subsidiary or any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree, known to us, of any government, government instrumentality or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, properties or operations, excluding any anti-fraud or similar law, rule or regulation.
 
(11) The Company is not, and, upon the issuance and sale of the Securities as contemplated in the Underwriting Agreement and the receipt and application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Pre-Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds," will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" as such terms are defined in the 1940 Act.
In addition, such counsel shall state that, in acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement they have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants and counsel for the Company and representatives of the Underwriters, at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and any supplements or amendments to any of the foregoing, and related matters were discussed. Although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, the Prospectus or any supplements and amendments to any of the foregoing, and has made no independent check or verification thereof (except as set forth in paragraph 8 above), nothing has come to such counsel's attention that would lead such counsel to believe that
 
 
 
except in each case that such counsel need make no statement and express no belief with respect to financial statements and schedules and other financial or statistical data included or incorporated by reference in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing.
In the event that such opinion shall define the term "Registration Statement," "Pre-Pricing Prospectus" or "Prospectus" (rather than indicating that such terms, as used in such opinion, have the respective meanings given thereto in the Underwriting Agreement), such opinion shall define the terms "Registration Statement," "Pre-Pricing Prospectus" and "Prospectus" to include the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.
 
In rendering such opinion, Company Counsel shall state that such opinion covers matters arising under the laws of the States of Texas and New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the federal laws of the United States of America. In rendering such opinion, Company Counsel may rely, as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.
 
To such counsel's knowledge, except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, now pending or threatened, against or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries which is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Pre-Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, or which might reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or to materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents or the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder.
Such opinion shall define the term "knowledge" to mean the actual knowledge of such counsel after inquiry of personnel of the Company who have responsibility for the subject matter of such opinion.
In the event that such opinion shall define the term "Registration Statement," "General Disclosure Package" or "Prospectus" (rather than indicating that such terms, as used in such opinion, have the respective meanings given thereto in the Underwriting Agreement), such opinion shall define the terms "Registration Statement," "General Disclosure Package" and "Prospectus" to include the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein.
