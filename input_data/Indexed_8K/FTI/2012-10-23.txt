FMC Technologies Reports Third Quarter 2012
Diluted Earnings per Share of $0.41
HOUSTON, October 23, 2012
- FMC Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:FTI) today reported third quarter 2012 revenue of $1.4 billion, up 10 percent from the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.41 compared to $0.50 in the prior-year quarter as improved Subsea Technologies' results were more than offset by higher non-operating expenses, a weaker North American Surface Technologies market, and less favorable results in our Energy Infrastructure segment.
Total inbound orders were $1.4 billion and included $885.5 million in Subsea Technologies orders. Backlog for the Company was $5.3 billion, including Subsea Technologies backlog of $4.4 billion.
Subsea Technologies' margins increased again this quarter to 12.4 percent, said John Gremp, Chairman and CEO of FMC Technologies. Execution has improved and we expect continued solid performance in the coming quarters. We remain positive on the overall subsea market outlook, and expect Subsea Technologies' revenue to approach $4 billion in 2012. However, North American activity weighs
on our Surface Technologies' outlook. We are revising our full year diluted earnings per share range to $1.85 to $1.95.

Review of Operations - Third Quarter 2012
Subsea Technologies
Subsea Technologies third quarter revenue was $929.2 million, up 11 percent from the prior-year quarter.
Subsea Technologies operating profit increased 20 percent from the prior-year quarter to $115.5 million due to improved performance and greater volume.
Subsea Technologies inbound orders in the third quarter were $885.5 million and backlog was $4.4 billion.
Surface Technologies
Surface Technologies third quarter revenue of $362.8 million was eight percent higher than the prior-year quarter, driven by higher volumes in surface wellhead.
Surface Technologies had operating profit of $57.5 million in the third quarter, down 13 percent from the prior-year quarter as the result of a less favorable sales mix.
Surface Technologies inbound orders were $340.3 million in the third quarter and backlog for the segment finished the quarter at $554.6 million.
Energy Infrastructure
Energy Infrastructures third quarter revenue was $133.2 million, up three percent from the prior-year quarter.
Energy Infrastructure had operating profit of $7.7 million in the third quarter, down 45 percent from the prior-year quarter driven primarily by lower margin projects in direct drive systems and separation systems.
Energy Infrastructures inbound orders for the third quarter were $157.5 million and backlog was $312.7 million.
Corporate Items
Corporate expense in the third quarter was $11.5 million, an increase of $2.2 million from the prior-year quarter. Other revenue and other expense, net, was $29.3 million, an increase of $32.0 million from the prior-year quarter. This was largely due to an increase of $11.9 million related to the estimated
earn-out associated with the acquisition of Multi Phase Meters and an $8.5 million increase in pension expense.

Technologies' orders. The Company's backlog stands at $5.3 billion, including Subsea Technologies' backlog of $4.4 billion.
North American Surface Technologies activity is declining at a faster pace than was anticipated and is having a greater impact on second half results.
