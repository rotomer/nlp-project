The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2003 and is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals. The sales price approximates the book value of The Gas Company. Citizens will have generated $1.9 billion of proceeds from its utility sales after the closing of The Gas Company of Hawaii sale and its previously announced Arizona Electric and Gas sales, which exceeds the company's original estimate of $1.8 billion for total proceeds from the divestiture of all of its utility divisions, with its Vermont Electric division still remaining to be sold. Citizens will apply the net cash proceeds from the sales of Arizona Electric and Gas and The Gas Company of Hawaii to its ongoing program of debt reduction. Citizens has retired approximately $1.062 billion, or 16.4 percent, of its debt during 2002. Separately, the company has concluded its internal investigation of the theft by two former officers of the company. The previously reported amount of the theft of $7.8 million has not changed. The company continues to believe that substantially all of the cash will be recovered from the former officers and from insurance. The theft does not affect the company's previously completed sales of utility properties and does not relate to the company's current operations in Arizona, Hawaii or Vermont. The company continues to cooperate fully with the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and with the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission. K-1 USA Ventures, Inc. is a subsidiary of k1 Ventures Limited. K1 Ventures Limited is domiciled and incorporated in the Republic of Singapore, invests in a wide range of investments across diverse sectors including energy, consumer products, technology and healthcare, and is listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the Singapore Stock Exchange).
