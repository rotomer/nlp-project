The ILEC segment produced adjusted EBITDA of $278 million and had capital expenditures of $83 million for the quarter. The company produced free cash flow of $333 million for the full year 2002 and achieved a net debt to annualized Adjusted EBITDA ratio for the fourth quarter of 3.9x, surpassing the targeted year-end ratio. The company prepaid $344 million of debt during the quarter and repaid $1.06 billion (or 16 percent) of its debt during the year, and ended the quarter with over $393 million in cash. The company remains focused on and committed to the continuing improvement of its balance sheet through the generation of free cash flow applied to further debt reduction. In addition, the sale of the company's Arizona Electric and Gas divisions for $230 million in cash and the sale of The Gas Company of Hawaii division for $115 million in cash are expected to close during the second half of 2003. The net proceeds from these sales will be used to further reduce debt. For the fourth quarter 2002 consolidated results were revenues of $659 million; operating income of $99 million; capital expenditures of $115 million; free cash flow of $71 million; and the net loss was $24 million. During the fourth quarter the company also reduced stockholders' equity by $112 million as a result of certain pension matters previously disclosed. After giving effect to this reduction the company's "net worth" as calculated pursuant to certain debt agreements was $1.83 billion at Dec. 31, 2002. Telecommunications Fourth quarter 2002 revenue from the company's ILEC operations was $520.4 million, up $9.7 million or 2 percent from $510.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, primarily due to continued increases in penetration of data, enhanced service and long-distance products, sales of special access services and increased subsidies. For the full year, revenue from the company's ILEC operations was $2.063 billion, up $468.9 million, or 29 percent. ILEC operating income for the fourth quarter was $89.2 million, up $56.2 million, or 170 percent from the fourth quarter of 2001, and for the full year was $413 million compared to $221 million in 2001. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $278 million, an increase of $24 million or 10 percent compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth-quarter of 2002 increased to 53.5 percent from 49.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001, reflecting increases in high-margin revenues, an ongoing focus on increased productivity and the efficiencies achieved from consolidation of the company's activities. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2002 was $1.097 billion, an increase of $294 million or 37 percent from the prior year.
Capital expenditures for the ILEC were $83 million and operating cash flow (Adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures) was $195 million for the quarter. For the full year 2002 ILEC capital expenditures were $289 million and operating cash flow was $808 million. Fourth-quarter 2002 revenue from Electric Lightwave totaled $41.2 million, Adjusted EBITDA was $9.8 million, capital expenditures were $3.8 million and operating cash flow was $6 million. For the full year 2002, revenue totaled $175 million, Adjusted EBITDA was $17.1 million, capital expenditures were $12 million and operating cash flow was $5.1 million. Public Service The gas and electric segments accounted for $97 million of fourth-quarter 2002 consolidated revenue, $10.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA and $9.1 million of capital expenditures. For the full year 2002, the gas and electric segment accounted for $431.3 million of consolidated revenue, $76.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA, $39.7 million of capital expenditures and $36.4 million of operating cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA (operating income plus depreciation and amortization) plus restructuring and other expenses, loss on impairment and reserve for telecommunications bankruptcies. Free cash flow is operating income plus depreciation and amortization and the loss on impairment, minus cash capital expenditures, cash interest expense and cash taxes. EBITDA is a measure commonly used to analyze companies on the basis of operating performance. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles nor is it an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
