Zarrella Assistant Vice President Vice President Corporate Communications Corporate Development 203.614.5042 203.614.5179 bsmith@czn.com mzarrell@czn.com - -------------- ---------------- Citizens Communications Reports 2003 First-Quarter Results Stamford, Conn., May 6, 2003 - Citizens Communications (NYSE:CZN) today reported first quarter 2003 consolidated revenues of $651.9 million; consolidated operating income of $164.3 million; and consolidated net income of $127.4 million, or 45 cents per share. Consolidated net income for the quarter includes a $40.7 million non-cash pre-tax gain from the extinguishment of a capital lease obligation at Electric Lightwave, a $2.4 million pre-tax charge related to early debt retirement and a $65.8 million non-cash after-tax gain from the adoption of new accounting rules with respect to asset retirement obligations (SFAS No. 143). Excluding these items, consolidated net income was $38.2 million, or 14 cents per share. The company produced free cash flow of $146.8 million for the first quarter 2003 and achieved a ratio of net debt to annualized Adjusted EBITDA of 3.7x and a ratio of net debt to annualized operating income of 6.8x. The company retired $123.4 million of debt during the quarter and ended the quarter with $455.9 million in cash. The company remains focused on and committed to the continuing improvement of its balance sheet through the generation of free cash flow applied to further debt reduction. In addition, the sale of the company's Arizona Electric and Gas divisions for $230 million ($220 million if closing occurs by July 28, 2003) in cash and the sale of The Gas Company of Hawaii division for $115 million in cash remain on track for closings during the second half of 2003. The company also recently announced that it has entered into definitive agreements to sell its Vermont Electric division for $25 million in cash. The sale of the Vermont business is expected to close in mid-2004 and will complete the divestiture of all of the company's utility businesses. After completion of all of these sales Citizens will have generated $1.9 billion of proceeds from its utility divestiture program, which exceeds the company's original estimate of $1.8 billion of total proceeds. The net proceeds from the remaining sales will be used to further reduce debt. Telecommunications First quarter 2003 revenue from the company's ILEC operations was $513.6 million, up $5.6 million or 1.1 percent from $508 million in the first quarter of 2002, primarily due to continued increases in penetration of data, enhanced service and long distance products and increased subsidies.
ILEC operating income for the first quarter of 2003 was $146.9 million, up $54.7 million, or 59.3 percent from the first quarter of 2002. Operating income margin was 28.6 percent compared to 18.2 percent in the first quarter of 2002. ILEC Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2003 was $279.3 million, an increase of $15 million or 5.7 percent compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter of 2003 increased to 54.4 percent from 52.0 percent in the first quarter of 2002, reflecting increases in high-margin revenues, an ongoing focus on increased productivity and the efficiencies achieved from consolidation of the company's activities. Capital expenditures for the ILEC were $37.9 million for the first quarter 2003. First quarter 2003 revenue from Electric Lightwave totaled $41.1 million, operating income was $0.5 million, Adjusted EBITDA was $6.7 million and capital expenditures were $1.1 million. Public Service The gas and electric segments accounted for $97.2 million of first quarter 2003 consolidated revenue, $16.8 million of operating income, $16.8 million of Adjusted EBITDA and $8.3 million of capital expenditures. The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net income excluding certain items, free cash flow and the ratio of net debt to annualized Adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this press release are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is operating income plus (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) restructuring and other expenses (primarily severance costs and expenses related to reorganizing our telecom operations after the acquisition of Frontier) and (iii) reserves for certain telecommunications bankruptcies (Global Crossing and Worldcom). Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Net income excluding certain items is net income without taking into account the items described in the first paragraph. Free cash flow is operating income plus depreciation and amortization minus capital expenditures, cash interest expense and cash taxes. Net debt to annualized Adjusted EBITDA is the ratio of (i) total debt (excluding equity units and convertible preferred) net of cash and cash equivalents to (ii) Adjusted EBITDA for the period indicated multiplied by four. The company believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it (i) reflects management's view of core operations and cash flow generation upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions, (ii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are important in assessing the company and (iii) indicates the company's actual performance compared to the covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA contained in certain of its debt agreements. While the company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA and net income excluding certain items exclude the items described above, some of which may recur in future periods, in order to focus on core operations.
In addition, annualized Adjusted EBITDA and annualized operating income present quarterly information for purposes of ratio analysis as annualized information by multiplying the quarterly information by four, without representing in any way a forecast, projection or estimate of Adjusted EBITDA or operating income for future periods.
