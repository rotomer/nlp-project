Schneider, Citizens' President and Chief Operating Officer, has informed the Company of his intention to leave his position as President and Chief Operating Officer of Citizens after Citizens' Board of Directors has reached a final determination in connection with its evaluation of a range of possible financial and strategic alternatives. Such determination is expected to be completed by mid-year. Dr. Leonard Tow, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated that Mr. Schneider will continue to be intimately involved with the Citizens team as it evaluates alternatives and that he will continue to serve as a director of Citizens after his departure as an officer of Citizens. "Scott made significant contributions to the success that we are reporting today in our 2003 results, just as he was an important factor in the success of the businesses he and I have worked on together over the past 20 years. Upon Scott's departure, I will reassume the office of President and we will establish an Office of the President consisting of Jake Casey as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Jerry Elliott as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and me. As senior members of Citizens' management team over the past few years, Jake and Jerry have made important contributions to the Company's many successes. Their intimate involvement in Citizens' operating and financial affairs assures a smooth transition of managerial responsibilities. Together, we will execute the plan we adopt." -- MORE --
Mr. Schneider stated: "As you might imagine, I reached this decision only after much soul searching, both professionally and personally. Leonard and I have worked together closely for more than 20 years, and Claire and Leonard are my close friends and confidants. I have told Leonard and the Board that I will work with our management team, our Board and our advisors in the coming months to assist the Board in reaching its determination. My departure is solely driven by my desires to pursue other options that may be available to me at this time in my career, and should not, under any circumstance, be taken as an expression of any concern with Citizens' business or prospects."
