Exhibit 99.1 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 Web site: www.czn.net - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contacts: Brigid M. Smith Michael A. Zarrella Assistant Vice President Vice President Corporate Communications Corporate Development 203.614.5042 203.614.5179 bsmith@czn.com mzarrell@czn.com Citizens Communications Reports 2004 First-Quarter Results Stamford, Conn., May 6, 2004 -- Citizens Communications (NYSE: CZN) today reported first-quarter 2004 consolidated revenues of $558.5 million, consolidated operating income of $139.8 million, and consolidated net income of $42.9 million. Consolidated operating income reflects $4.6 million of expenses related to the company's ongoing review of financial and strategic alternatives and related compensation arrangements. Consolidated net income for the quarter also includes a pre-tax gain of $24.2 million related to the expiration of certain liabilities. First-quarter 2004 revenue from the company's ILEC operations was $509.0 million, compared to $513.6 million in the first quarter of 2003. The decrease is due primarily to lower access services revenues, reduced long-distance revenue, loss of access lines and the sale of approximately 11,000 access lines in North Dakota in April 2003 (which had revenues of $2.1 million during the first quarter of 2003). These decreases were partially offset by continued increases in data and enhanced service revenues. The company added a record 21,500 DSL customers during the quarter and had almost 142,000 DSL subscribers at March 31, 2004. The company's access line count, which does not take into account DSL subscriptions, decreased 10,800 lines during the quarter. ILEC operating income for the first quarter of 2004 was $138.7 million and operating income margin was 27.3 percent. Capital expenditures for the ILEC were $52.9 million for the first quarter of 2004. First quarter 2004 revenue from Electric Lightwave totaled $39.8 million, operating income was $2.4 million, and capital expenditures were $1.8 million. --MORE--
The company produced free cash flow of $133.3 million and retired $93.6 million of debt during the first-quarter 2004 and ended the quarter with $648.0 million in cash. For the first-quarter 2004 the company reported net cash provided by operating activities of $207.2 million, net cash used in investing activities of $55.2 million, and net cash used in financing activities of $87.7 million. On April 1, 2004, the company closed its final utility sale with the completion of the sales of its Vermont Electric division. The company has completed its utility divestiture program, generating a total of $1.9 billion of proceeds, which exceeds the company's original estimate of $1.8 billion. The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow. A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The company believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial- analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions, and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations and its divisions measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the company believes that free cash flow, as the company defines it, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. --MORE--
While the company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments are not deducted from such measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.
