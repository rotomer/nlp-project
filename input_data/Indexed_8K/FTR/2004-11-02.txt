Smith Michael A. Zarrella Assistant Vice President Vice President Corporate Communications Corporate Development 203.614.5042 203.614.5179 bsmith@czn.com mzarrell@czn.com Citizens Communications Reports 2004 Third-Quarter Results Stamford, Conn., November 2, 2004 -- Citizens Communications (NYSE:CZN) today reported third-quarter 2004 consolidated revenues of $545.4 million; consolidated operating income of $72 million; and consolidated net loss of $11.3 million. Consolidated operating income and net loss reflect $75.9 million of pre-tax expense related primarily to management succession as well as our review of financial and strategic alternatives, and consolidated net loss also reflects $20.1 million of pre-tax expense related to the early retirement of debt. The company's effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2004 was 21.5%. Third-quarter 2004 revenue from the company's ILEC operations was $506.2 million, compared to $511.6 million in the third quarter of 2003. The decrease is due primarily to lower access services revenues, loss of access lines and reduced long-distance revenue. These decreases were partially offset by continued increases in data and enhanced service revenues. Data service revenues increased 31% compared to the third quarter of 2003. Average revenue per month per average number of access lines increased 1% to $71.68 in the third quarter of 2004 from $70.70 in the year-ago period. The company's revenue generating units (which consist of access lines and high-speed data subscribers) increased 1% from a year ago as the company added a record 23,300 high-speed internet customers during the quarter and had 187,500 high speed data subscribers at September 30, 2004. The number of high-speed data subscribers has increased by 77% from a year ago. The company's primary access line count, which does not take into account high-speed data subscriptions, decreased 16,300 lines during the quarter. ILEC operating income for the third quarter of 2004 was $71.2 million and operating income margin was 14.1 % including the effect of the expenses related to management succession and our review of financial and strategic alternatives. --MORE --
Capital expenditures for the ILEC were $66 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared to $67 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow increased 22% to $131 million during the third quarter of 2004 and has increased 3% to $377.4 million for the first nine months of 2004. The company's quarterly dividend represents a payout of 63% of third quarter 2004 Free Cash Flow. In the third quarter of 2004 we retired $414 million of debt using cash on hand. We expect to save approximately $28 million per year in interest expense as a result of the retirements that occurred during the third quarter. The company has retired a total of $513.8 million of debt during 2004. In October 2004 the company entered into a $250 million revolving credit facility that matures in 2009. This facility replaces the company's previous credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in 2006. The company's next quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share will be paid in cash on December 31, 2004 to shareholders of record on December 10, 2004. The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow. A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The company believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations and its divisions measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the company believes that free cash flow, as the company defines it, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. --MORE --
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions; and (v) assist management in understanding the company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. While the company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments are not deducted from such measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.
