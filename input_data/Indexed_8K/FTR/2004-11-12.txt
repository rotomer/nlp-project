(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred) that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or that arise out of, or are based upon, any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
(b)           Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(c)           In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either Section 6(a) or 6(b), such person (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)           To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a) or 6(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 6(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 6(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes
shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Notes.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Notes they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e)           The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
(f)            The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
7.             TERMINATION.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by the Representative to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Representative, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses 7(a)(i) through 7(a)(iv), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
8.             DEFAULTING UNDERWRITERS.  If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Notes that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Underwriters' Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of Underwriters' Notes set forth opposite their respective names in the Underwriting Agreement bears to the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representative may specify, to purchase the Underwriters' Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; PROVIDED that in no event shall the amount of Underwriters' Notes that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Underwriters' Notes without the written consent of such Underwriter.  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Notes and the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Underwriters' Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representative and the Company for the purchase of such Underwriters' Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In any such case either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
9.             COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
10.           APPLICABLE LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
11.           HEADINGS.  The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please indicate your acceptance of this Agreement by signing in the space provided below.

The genuineness of all signatures.

(ii)           The Company has full power to execute, deliver and perform the Opinion Documents to which it is a party.
(iii)          The execution, delivery and performance of the Company of the Opinion Documents to which it is a party does not:

We have not independently established the validity of the foregoing assumptions.
"" means the federal law of the United States of America, and the law of the State of New York (including the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant thereto), that a New York lawyer exercising customary professional diligence would reasonably be expected to recognize as being applicable to the Company, the Opinion Documents or the transactions governed by the Opinion Documents, and for purposes of assumption paragraph (f) above and our opinion in paragraph 1 below, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition of Generally Applicable Law, the term "Generally Applicable Law" does not include any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Opinion Documents or such transactions solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to the specific assets or business of any party to any of the Opinion Documents or any of its affiliates.
Generally Applicable Law
Based upon the foregoing and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
1.         The Company has taken all corporate action necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of each Opinion Document to which it is a party.
2.         The Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
3.         The Indenture has been duly executed and delivered and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
4.         The Notes have been duly executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and delivered and paid for as provided in the Agreement, the Notes will be the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
5.         The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
 
                Our opinions expressed above are subject to the following qualifications:
(a)           Our opinions in paragraphs 3 and 4 above are subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers).
(b)           Our opinions in paragraphs 3 and 4 are also subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(c)           Our opinions are limited to Generally Applicable Law and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law.
 
                                This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Opinion Documents.  This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose without our prior written consent.

Schedule 1
Agreement referenced below
 
c/o J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
270 Park Avenue
New York, New York  10017
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Citizens Communications Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale of $700 million aggregate principal amount of  6  % senior notes (each, a "Senior Note" and collectively, the "Senior Notes") due 2013.  The Senior Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture (as defined below).
This opinion letter is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 4(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2004, between the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as Representative of the several Underwriters listed in thereto.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
Schedule 1
In connection with this opinion letter, we have examined and are familiar with originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-58044, as amended to the date hereof (the "Registration Statement"), (ii) the Company's Prospectus, dated May 9, 2001 (the "Basic Prospectus"), and Prospectus Supplement, dated November 8, 2004 (as supplemented, the "Prospectus"), (iii) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as currently in effect, (iv) the By-Laws of the Company, as currently in effect, (v) resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company relating to, among other things, the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes, (vi) the Underwriting Agreement, (vii) the Senior Indenture, dated as of May 23, 2001, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as successor to The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee (the "Indenture Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture to the Indenture, dated as of November [  ], 2004 (such indenture, as so supplemented and amended, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Indenture Trustee, relating to the Senior Notes, and (viii) the form of the Senior Notes and specimens thereof. The Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture are collectively referred to in this opinion letter as the "Transaction Documents." We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or representatives of the Company and others, and such other agreements, docu-
ments, instruments, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have, with your consent, assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, photostatic, conformed or telecopied copies, the authenticity of the originals of such copies, the legal capacity of natural persons and the accuracy of all certificates of public officials.  As to questions of fact not independently verified by us we have relied, to the extent we deemed appropriate, upon representations, certificates and statements of officers and representatives of the Company, public officials and other persons we deemed appropriate.  Additionally, we have, with your consent, assumed and relied upon the following:
(a)
                                 
the accuracy of all certificates and other statements, documents, records, financial statements and papers reviewed by us, and the accuracy of all representations, warranties, schedules and exhibits contained in the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, with respect to the factual matters set forth therein;
(b)
                                
all parties to the documents reviewed by us (other than the Company) are duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of formation and under the laws of all jurisdictions where they are conducting their businesses or otherwise required to be so qualified, and have full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform under such documents and all such documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such parties; and
(c)
                                 
each of the Transaction Documents constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of each party thereto (other than the Company) enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms.
The phrases "best of our knowledge", "to our knowledge", "to our actual knowledge", "known to us", "we are not aware of", or similar phrases, as used herein, mean that during the course of our representation of the Company no information has come to our attention that would give us current actual knowledge, and as to the last sentence of paragraph 3 we have relied upon representations of the Company without further inquiry.
Based upon our examination as described above, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus.
2.  The Company has the authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus.
3. Each Significant Subsidiary of the Company is validly existing as a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation and has the corporate, limited liability company or partnership power and authority (as applicable) to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus.
4. The Company has the full right, corporate power and authority to execute and deliver each of the Transaction Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder.
5. The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Indenture, the Senior Notes, and the Underwriting Agreement will not contravene any provision of Applicable Law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is set forth as an Exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 (the "Form 10-K") or to any subsequently filed Current Reports on Form 8-K or Quarterly Reports on Form l0-Q or, to the best of our knowledge, any judgment, order or decree of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or qualification with, any Governmental Authority is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Transaction Documents, except such as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the Senior Notes.
6. The descriptions in the Prospectus of statutes and contracts and other documents are accurate in all material respects. The statements (a) in the Prospectus Supplement under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Underwriting", (b) in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Plan of Distribution," and (c) in Part II of the Registration Statement under Item 15, in each case insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters, documents, or conclusions referred to therein, in each case in all material respects fairly presents the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and conclusions and fairly summarizes the matters referred to therein. We do not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and are not so described or of any statutes, regulations, contracts or other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described, filed or incorporated as required.
7. The Company is not an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, without taking into account any exemption under the Investment Company Act arising out of the number of holders of the Company's securities.
8. The Company is not a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
9. Each document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act subsequent to December 31, 2003 incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which we express no opinion) (such documents are referred to as the "Exchange Act Documents") complied when so filed as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder; and the Registration Statement, when it became effective, and the Prospectus, as of November 8, 2004 (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein as to which we express no opinion), complied as to form in all material respects with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
10. Subject to the qualifications and limitations stated therein, the statements set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal income tax laws and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects.

Re:

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
                We have acted as special counsel to Citizens Communications Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with (i) the issuance by the Company of up to $700,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6% senior notes due 2013 (the "Notes") pursuant to the prospectus supplement dated November 8, 2004 (the "Prospectus Supplement") to the prospectus dated May 9, 2001 forming part of the Registration Statement of the Company on Form S-3, File No. 333-58044 as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto (as amended, the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and (ii) the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company to be filed with the Commission on November 12, 2004 (the "Current Report"). The Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of May 23, 2001 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of November 12, 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture").
 
                In rendering the opinion set forth herein, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Registration Statement, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and originals, telecopies or photocopies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company and all such agreements, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers or representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents, certificates and corporate or other records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for this opinion. As to all matters of fact (including, without limitation, matters of fact set forth in this opinion), we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy of statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than those on behalf of the Company), the legal capacity of natural persons signing or delivering any instrument, the authority of all persons signing the Registration Statement, the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, certified or otherwise,
and the authenticity of the originals of such documents, and that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee.
 
                Based upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and exceptions heretofore and hereinafter set forth, we are of the opinion that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is valid and binding and enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, and when (a) the Supplemental Indenture is duly executed and delivered by the Company substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 4.1 to the Current Report, (b) the Supplemental Indenture is duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 4.1 to the Current Report and (c) the Notes are duly executed by the Company and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, against payment therefor as contemplated by the Prospectus Supplement, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
 
                Our opinions set forth in the foregoing paragraph are (in addition to any other limitations set forth herein) limited by the laws, principles and public policies referred to in the following clauses (a) through (c):
 
                                               
                (a)           Applicable bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of the rights and remedies of creditors, secured parties and parties to contracts generally.
 
                                               
                (b)           General principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and the exercise of equitable powers by a court of competent jurisdiction (and no opinion is given herein as to any specific or equitable relief of any kind or as to the availability of equitable remedies).
 
                                               
                (c)           Law and public policy governing provisions of any of the Indenture, Supplemental Indenture or Notes with respect to contribution, reimbursement, indemnification or the like or prospectively releasing a party with respect to any liability or claim.
 
                We do not express, or purport to express, any opinion with respect to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Connecticut, the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal securities laws of the United States of America.
 
                We hereby consent to the filing of this letter as an exhibit to the Current Report and further consent to the use of our name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus which forms a part of the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we
do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commission. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter occur or come to our attention or any changes in law which may hereafter occur.
