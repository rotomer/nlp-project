ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement ------------------------------------------ On February 1, 2005, Peter B. Hayes commenced employment with Citizens Communications Company (the "Company") as Senior Vice President, Sales, Marketing & Business Development. The terms of Mr. Hayes's at-will employment are set forth in an offer letter from the Company to Mr. Hayes, dated December 20, 2004. The offer letter states an annual base salary of $275,000 and an annual incentive target equal to 75% of annual base salary (pro-rated for 2005). In addition, the Company granted 50,000 shares of restricted stock to Mr. Hayes on February 1, 2005, which shares vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, and he received a $25,000 sign-on bonus. In connection with his employment, Mr. Hayes is being relocated from London. Mr. Hayes will receive the following benefits related to his relocation: (i) movement of household goods and travel from London to the Stamford, Connecticut, area (ii) a monthly allowance of $4,000 to maintain a temporary apartment in the Stamford, Connecticut area and to pay travel expenses for the first year of employment, and (iii) a monthly allowance thereafter of $4,000 for living and travel expenses if Mr. Hayes does not move his permanent residence to the Stamford, Connecticut area. If Mr. Hayes does relocate to the Stamford, Connecticut area his relocation benefit associated with that relocation would be reduced by the amount of monthly allowance paid to him through the date of such relocation. In addition, if Mr. Hayes leaves the Company within two years of the date of hire, he will be required to reimburse the Company for a pro-rated portion of his relocation benefits. Mr. Hayes's offer letter also provides that if there is a change of control (defined as 51% of the Company being sold) and there is a subsequent decrease in Mr. Hayes's responsibility, title, base salary or target incentive opportunity (as a percentage of base salary) or if his work location is relocated more than twenty-five miles from Stamford, Connecticut, Mr. Hayes would be eligible to receive one year of base salary, 100% of the annual bonus (pro-rated for the plan year) and one year of continued medical benefits.
