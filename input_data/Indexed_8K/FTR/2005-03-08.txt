Exhibit 99.1 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 Web site: www.czn.net - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contacts: Brigid M. Smith Michael A. Zarrella Assistant Vice President Vice President Corporate Communications Corporate Development 203.614.5042 203.614.5179 bsmith@czn.com mzarrell@czn.com Citizens Communications Reports 2004 Fourth-Quarter Results and Declares Dividend Stamford, Conn., March 8, 2005 -- Citizens Communications (NYSE:CZN) today reported fourth-quarter 2004 consolidated revenues of $545 million, consolidated operating income of $144.4 million, and consolidated net income of $16.8 million. Consolidated net income reflects $50.3 million of pre-tax expense related to the early retirement of debt. The company's effective income tax rate for 2004 was 15.6 percent. Fourth-quarter 2004 revenue from the company's ILEC operations was $506.3 million, an increase from $505.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Increases in data and enhanced service revenues more than offset lower access services revenues, reduced long distance revenue and loss of access lines. Data service revenues increased 28 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. The company's revenue generating units (which consists of access lines and high-speed Internet subscribers) increased 1 percent from a year ago as the company added a record 24,800 high-speed Internet customers during the quarter and had 212,300 high-speed data subscribers at December 31, 2004. The number of the company's high-speed Internet subscribers has increased by 76 percent from a year ago. The company's access line count, which does not take into account high-speed Internet subscribers, decreased 25,200 lines during the quarter. ILEC operating income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $139.9 million and operating income margin was 27.6 percent, compared to $134.7 million and 26.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003. Capital expenditures for the ILEC were $71.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to $82.8 million in the year-ago period. Free Cash flow increased 13 percent to $127.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2004 and increased 6 percent to $505.9 million for the full year. The company's quarterly dividend represents a payout of 66 percent of 2004 Free Cash Flow. During 2004 the company retired or refinanced more than $1.2 billion of debt. The company expects to save approximately $60.4 million per year in interest expense as a result of these transactions. --MORE --
The company's next quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share will be paid in cash on March 31, 2005 to shareholders of record on March 18, 2005. The company expects that all of the dividends paid to stockholders in 2005 will be treated as dividends for federal income tax purposes. Shareholders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors. The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow. A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The company believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations and its divisions measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the company believes that free cash flow, as the company defines it, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions; and (v) assist management in understanding the company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. While the company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted from such measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.
