Zarrella Assistant Vice President Vice President Corporate Communications Corporate Development 203.614.5042 203.614.5179 bsmith@czn.com mzarrell@czn.com Citizens Communications Reports 2005 First-Quarter Results Stamford, Conn., May 3, 2005 -- Citizens Communications (NYSE:CZN) today reported first quarter 2005 consolidated revenues of $537.2 million; consolidated operating income of $145.1 million; and consolidated net income of $42.6 million. Consolidated net income includes $2.2 million, net of taxes, from our conferencing service business, which was sold in March 2005 and is therefore treated as a discontinued operation. First-quarter 2005 revenue from the company's ILEC operations was $499.2 million, a decrease from $502.8 million in the first quarter of 2004. The decrease was due primarily to loss of access lines, lower access service revenues and reduced long-distance revenue. Strong growth in data and enhanced service revenues offset most of the decreases. Data service revenues increased 21.9 percent compared to the first quarter of 2004. The company's revenue generating units (which consist of access lines and High-Speed Internet subscribers) increased 1 percent from a year ago as the company added a record 30,500 High-Speed Internet customers during the quarter and had 242,800 High-Speed data subscribers at March 31, 2005. The number of the company's High-Speed Internet subscribers has increased by more than 100,000 or 71 percent from a year ago. The company's access line count decreased 22,300 lines during the quarter. ILEC operating income for the first quarter of 2005 was $144.4 million and operating income margin was 28.9 percent, compared to $136.5 million and 27.1 percent in the first quarter of 2004. Capital expenditures for the ILEC were $47.3 million for the first quarter of 2005, compared to $52.8 million in the year ago period. Free cash flow increased 12.4 percent to $152.9 million during the first quarter of 2005. The company's quarterly dividend represented a payout of 55.6 percent of first-quarter 2005 free cash flow. The company expects to continue to pay its dividend of $0.25 per common share on the last day of each quarter. -MORE-
The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow. A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non- GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The company believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations and its divisions measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the company believes that free cash flow, as the company defines it, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions; and (v) assist management in understanding the company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. While the company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted from such measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures. The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. -MORE-
