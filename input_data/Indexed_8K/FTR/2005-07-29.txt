Exhibit 99.1 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 Web site: www.czn.net Contacts: Brigid M. Smith Michael A. Zarrella Assistant Vice President Vice President Corporate Communications Corporate Development 203.614.5042 203.614.5179 bsmith@czn.com mzarrell@czn.com Citizens Communications Reports 2005 Second-Quarter Results; Declares Quarterly Dividend Stamford, Conn., July 29, 2005 -- Citizens Communications (NYSE:CZN) today reported second quarter 2005 consolidated revenues of $531.8 million; consolidated operating income of $146.9 million; and consolidated net income of $44.6 million. Second quarter 2005 revenue from the company's ILEC operations was $492.8 million, a decrease from $499.5 million in the second quarter of 2004. The decrease is due primarily to a reserve for state earnings limitations, fewer access lines, lower access service revenues and reduced long distance revenue. Growth in data and enhanced service revenues partially offset the decreases. Data service revenues increased 26.1 percent compared to the second quarter of 2004. The company's revenue generating units (which consists of access lines and high speed internet subscribers) increased almost 1% from a year ago as the company added 24,500 high speed internet customers during the quarter and had 267,300 high speed data subscribers at June 30, 2005. The number of the company's high speed internet subscribers has increased by more than 103,000 or 63% from a year ago. The company's access line count decreased 23,000 lines during the quarter. ILEC operating income for the second quarter of 2005 was $142.1 million and operating income margin was 28.8 percent, compared to $125.1 million and 25.0 percent in the second quarter of 2004. Capital expenditures for the ILEC were $57.0 million for the second quarter of 2005. Free cash flow increased 30 percent to $138.1 million during the second quarter of 2005. The company's dividend represents a payout of 58.8 percent of free cash flow for the first six months of 2005. During the second quarter, the company repurchased $18.6 million of stock at an average price of $13.28 per share and exchanged $50 million of debt due in 2006 for debt that matures in 2031. The company's next regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on September 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on September 9, 2005. --MORE --
The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow. A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The company believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations and its divisions measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the company believes that free cash flow, as the company defines it, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions; and (v) assist management in understanding the company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. While the company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted from such measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.
