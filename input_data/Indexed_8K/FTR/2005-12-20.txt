Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. ------------------------------------------- (a) On December 14, 2005, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of Citizens Communications Company (the "Company") approved the Citizens Incentive Plan (the "Plan") for fiscal year 2006. The Plan assigns certain target amounts of incentive compensation for each career band for exempt and non-exempt full time employees eligible to participate in the Plan, except that in the case of senior executive officers, the targets are set for each position. The Committee determined that the cash incentive awards to executive and non-executive employees under the Plan would be based upon the achievement of specific goals that relate to the Company's people, products and profitability. The people goals include hiring and retaining employees and reinforcing the Company's performance culture through identified means. The product goals include improving and simplifying the Company's service delivery infrastructure, driving product sales in certain specified areas and developing and implementing new products. The profit goals include exceeding certain financial targets, including those for revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, increasing customer product revenue in identified areas and retaining the Company's customer base. The actual bonuses payable for fiscal year 2006 (if any) will vary depending on the extent to which actual performances meet, exceed, or fall short of the goals and criteria set by the Committee but will not exceed 120% of target. In addition, the Company's management and the Committee retain the discretion to increase, reduce or eliminate any bonus that otherwise might be payable to any individual based on actual performance as compared to pre-established goals. (b) On December 15, 2005, the Board of Directors voted to change the non-employee director compensation as follows: (1) Increase the annual retainer fee paid to each of its non-employee Directors from $30,000 or a number of stock units to $40,000 or a number of stock units. Payment of the retainer fee was changed from annually, in advance, to equal quarterly installments, payable on the first day of each quarter. Each director must irrevocably elect by December 31 of the prior year whether to receive his or her retainer in cash or units. (2) Reduce the fee payable for telephonic board and committee meetings to $1,000 from $2,000. The fee may, at the election of the director made before December 31 of the prior year, be paid in cash or stock units. The fee for regular board and committee meetings was not changed and continues to be $2,000. (3) Eliminate the provision of the Non-Employee Directors' Deferred Fee Equity Plan, that provides a director who elects to receive all or a portion of his meeting and/or committee chair fees in stock units will receive an increase in the number of stock units allocated to him or her if the average of the high and low trading price on the last trading day in November is less than the average of the high and low trading price on the first trading day in which the election was in effect.
