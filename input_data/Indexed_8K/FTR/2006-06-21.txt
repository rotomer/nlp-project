Exhibit 99.1 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 Web site: www.czn.net - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Karen Miller 845.344.9416 kmiller@czn.com Citizens Launches New Customer Operations Strategy Opening Call Center in DeLand, Fla. June 20, 2006 - Citizens' Dan McCarthy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, announced today that its Frontier operations would pursue a new strategy for its Customer Operations that will include consolidating all inbound customer calls to two or three centers and a Work at Home program nationwide by year-end 2007. The Company expects that this new strategy will improve its focus on delivering quality customer service and will, therefore, improve its competitiveness in the marketplace. A new Frontier Call Center will be established in DeLand, Florida in August of this year and will house up to 500 employees by year-end 2007. DeLand was selected because of the rich labor market, positive economic climate and opportunity to attract a strong employee base. "Our goal is to consolidate to two or three centers. We are reviewing all options regarding the locations of the second and/or third Call Centers," McCarthy said. "This announcement will be made at a later date." Homeshoring, Frontier's new work-at-home initiative, is currently being trialed and is a key element of the new Customer Operations strategy. If the pilot is successful, plans are to expand the homeshoring option to 15 - 20% of Call Center employees across the company. Homeshoring offers employees the convenience of working from home and virtually no commuting costs, while enabling us to provide around-the-clock service to customers with greater efficiency. It also enables a company to efficiently address peak-hour or emergency calling times without disrupting the customer experience. Investments in new technology will support this strategy and will allow each Call Center Representative to easily access different computer systems and assist customers with billing, repair or collections questions. This will improve efficiencies on all inbound calls. "We are continually looking for ways to improve our service delivery and infrastructure," said McCarthy. "Simplifying our business by improving our Call Center processes will provide additional value to our customers."
Frontier currently has Call Centers in Kingman, Ariz., Burnsville, Minn. and Gloversville, Middletown, Monroe and Rochester, N.Y., in addition to eight other smaller Call Centers in the country.
