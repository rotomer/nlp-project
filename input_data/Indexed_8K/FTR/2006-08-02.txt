Exhibit 99.2 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 Web site: www.czn.net - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Contact: Michael Bromley 203.614.5218 mbromley@czn.com Citizens Communications Reports 2006 Second-Quarter Results Stamford, Conn., August 2, 2006 -- Citizens Communications (NYSE:CZN) today reported second quarter 2006 revenues of $506.9 million, operating income of $169.5 million, and net income of $101.7 million. During the quarter, the company received approximately $65 million in cash upon the liquidation of the Rural Telephone Bank. Excluding the effects of the Rural Telephone Bank liquidation, net income would have been $63.0 million. Second quarter 2006 revenue increased 2.2 percent compared to the second quarter of 2005. The increase is due primarily to growth in data and internet services revenue and to a lesser extent higher access services revenues and higher enhanced services/features revenues. Data and internet services revenue increased 28.5 percent compared to the second quarter of 2005. Other operating expense decreased by approximately $6.8 million or 3.7 percent primarily driven by reductions in salaries and benefits as the company has 340 fewer employees and improved expense control in benefit costs. Depreciation expense for the second quarter of 2006 decreased $12.9 million as compared to the second quarter of 2005. The decrease is due to a declining asset base and changes in the projected useful lives of certain assets as determined by an independent study prepared last year. Depreciation expense is expected to decline in 2006 to approximately $350.0 million or by 11 percent compared to 2005. The company added 19,600 high-speed internet customers during the quarter and had over 350,000 high-speed data subscribers at June 30, 2006. The number of the company's high-speed internet subscribers has increased by more than 83,000 or 31.1 percent since June 30, 2005. Operating income for the second quarter of 2006 was $169.5 million and operating income margin was 33.4 percent, compared to $142.3 million and 28.7 percent in the second quarter of 2005. Capital expenditures were $54.5 million for the second quarter of 2006 and $98.3 million for the first six months of 2006. Free cash flow for the second quarter increased 17 percent to $155.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2005. The company's dividend represents a payout of 51.6 percent of free cash flow for the first six months of 2006. --MORE --
During the second quarter, the company repurchased $97.3 million of stock at an average price of $13.16. In addition, during the second quarter, the company retired at par $175 million of debentures due on June 1, 2006 and repurchased $22.7 million of its notes due August 17, 2006. As previously announced, the sale of Electric Lightwave, LLC (ELI) for $247 million (including $243 million in cash) closed on July 31, 2006. The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow. A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The company believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions, and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations and its divisions' measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the company believes that free cash flow, as the company defines it, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. --MORE --
While the company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted from such measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures. The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance. Words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements (including oral representations) involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. These risks and uncertainties are based on a number of factors, including but not limited to: our ability to effectively manage our operations, costs and capital spending; our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including bundled service packages; our ability to sell enhanced services; our ability to comply with federal and state regulations; changes in the number of our revenue generating units; general and local economic and employment conditions; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; overall changes in the telecommunications market; and greater than anticipated competition from wireless or wireline carriers. These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the foregoing information should be read in conjunction with these filing. We do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of future events or circumstances. ### TABLES TO FOLLOW
