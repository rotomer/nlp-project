Exhibit 99.1 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 Web site: www.czn.net - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Karen C. MIller 845-344-9416 kmiller@czn.com Citizens Communications Expands Wireless Data Coverage SUNY Orange NY Campus Gains Wireless Access; Elko County, Nev. Approves County-Wide Network Build-Out Stamford, Conn., Sept. 22, 2006 - Citizens Communications Company (NYSE: CZN) today announced that it will build a wireless data network at SUNY Orange to deliver high-speed Internet access to the Middletown, N.Y. college campus. This network is scheduled to be operational during the fourth quarter of 2006, giving students and faculty in the indoor and outdoor common areas and campus buildings the ability to access the college network and the Internet via a laptop and data card. Wireless broadband access is an increasingly critical need, especially in education. Students begin college expecting access to the latest technologies, especially wireless network connectivity. Citizens Communications, operating under the brand name of Frontier Communications, currently provides the SUNY Orange campus with fixed-line access to the Internet. The addition of wireless data capability will increase coverage and capacity, allowing a dramatic increase in the number of students and college staff who can utilize broadband. "Our Technology Master Plan, one of the College's five strategic priorities, focuses on technology upgrades in a number of areas that will enrich the learning environment for students and enhance our administrative efficiency as well," said Dr. Bill Richards, President, SUNY Orange. "From a management perspective, this is a burden off College resources since we're partnering with Frontier. Frontier provides the personnel and the equipment, and we pay for the services," said Jim Dutcher, Associate Vice President for Technology. "I look forward to the day when there is a wireless environment across all of our locations throughout Orange County. In fact, the design of the Newburgh Campus will include the most advanced technological environment we can afford so that the campus itself will be a learning laboratory for technological innovations. Obviously, we could not realize any of these dreams without the strong support of partners like Citizens Communications, whose generosity and friendship toward the College benefits students directly every day," Richards said. -More-
Elko, Nev. expands Wireless Data partnership with Frontier Frontier has also entered into an agreement with the County of Elko, Nev. to provide Wireless Data Broadband Access. Recently, the City of Elko and Frontier signed an agreement relating to the installation downtown of a Wi-Fi Broadband Mesh Network. The County project enhances wireless coverage in the area, since Phase 2 of the build plan will extend into the suburban communities that surround downtown. "We are very excited about adding the County of Elko to our Wireless Broadband footprint in Nevada. Elko County industries include the largest gold mining operations in the United States, as well as a newly-approved Railport. Frontier's Wireless Broadband will enhance connectivity options for these key businesses, provide a larger Hot-Spot territory for residents and visitors to the Elko community, and provide better coverage and better service overall," said Kerry Haley, Vice President and General Manager of Wireless Services for Frontier.
