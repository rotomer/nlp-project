Other Events
 
In an investor presentation made on December 4, 2006 (the Investor Presentation), Citizens Communications Company (the Company) reported free cash flow of $447.9 million and a dividend payout ratio as a percentage of free cash flow of 54.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. In the Companys third quarter 2006 earnings release and related schedules (the Earnings Release), the Company reported free cash flow of $429.4 million and a dividend payout ratio of 56.6% for the same period. The Investor Presentation measures include the results of operations of Electric Lightwave, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company that was sold on July 31, 2006. Including the results of ELI, free cash flow for the three months ended September 30, 2006 was $132.7 million, a 4.4% increase from the comparable 2005 period, as compared to the $127.6 million and 3.0% increase reported in the Earnings Release. The Companys free cash flow guidance for 2006 of between $500.0 million and $525.0 million assumed that ELIs results through the closing of the sale would be included. A reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the Investor Presentation. The schedule to the Earnings Release excluded ELI results from the calculation of free cash flow for all periods presented.
