(e)
  
Section 15.01 of the Base Indenture shall be amended by replacing it in its entirety with the following:

Right To Convert
. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Indenture, prior to July 15, 2023, the holder of any Note shall have the right, at such holders option, to convert the principal amount of the Note, or any portion of such principal amount which is a multiple of $1,000, into cash and fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (as such shares shall then be constituted) constituting a Unit (the 
Conversion Obligation
), by surrender of the Note so to be converted in whole or in part, together with any required funds, under the circumstances described in this Section 15.01 and in the manner provided in Section 15.02. The Notes shall be convertible only upon the occurrence of one of the following events:
 
(i)
  
during any Fiscal Quarter (and only during such Fiscal Quarters) commencing after September 30, 2003, if the Per Share Unit Value exceeds 120% of the then-effective Conversion Price for at least 20 Trading Days in the 30 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding Fiscal Quarter (it being understood for purposes of this Section 15.01(a)(i) that the Conversion Price in effect at the close of business on each of the 30 consecutive Trading Days should be used);
 
 
5
 
(ii)
  
during the five Business Day period immediately following any five consecutive Trading Day period (the 
Measurement Period
) in which the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes for each day of such Measurement Period was less than 98% of the Per Note Unit Value on such date;
provided
that
no conversion pursuant to this clause
 (ii) may be made after July 15, 2018, if on any Trading Day during the Measurement Period, the Per Share Unit Value is more than 100%, but less than 120% of the Conversion Price on such Trading Day;
 
(iii)
  
if such Note has been called for redemption, at any time on or after the date the notice of redemption has been given until the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the redemption date; or
 
(iv)
  
as provided in Section (b) of this Section 15.01.
 
The Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company) shall, on behalf of the Company, determine on a daily basis during the time period specified in Section 15.01(a)(i) whether the Notes shall be convertible as a result of the occurrence of an event specified in clause (i) above and, if the Notes shall be so convertible, the Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company) shall promptly deliver to the Company and the Trustee (if the Trustee is not the conversion agent) written notice thereof. Whenever the Notes shall become convertible pursuant to this Section 15.01, the Company or, at the Companys request, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall notify the holders of the event triggering such convertibility in the manner provided in Section 16.03, and the Company shall also publicly announce such information and publish it on the Companys web site. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice.
 
The Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company) shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price under this Section 15.01 unless the Company has requested such a determination; and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request unless a holder provides it with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes would be less than 98% of the Per Note Unit Value. If such evidence is provided, the Company shall instruct the Trustee (or other conversion agent) to determine the Trading Price of the Notes beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is greater than or equal to 98% of the Per Note Unit Value;
provided
that the Trustee shall be under no duty or obligation to make the calculations described in Section 15.01(a)(ii) hereof or to determine whether the Notes are convertible pursuant to such section. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall make the calculations described in Section 15.01(a)(ii), using the Trading Price provided by the Trustee.
 
 
6
 
The Trustee shall be entitled at its sole discretion to consult with the Company and to request the assistance of the Company in connection with the Trustees duties and obligations pursuant to Section 15.01(a)(i) and Section 15.01(a)(ii) hereof (including without limitation the calculation or determination of the Conversion Price, the Closing Sale Price and the Trading Price), and the Company agrees, if requested by the Trustee, to cooperate with, and provide assistance to, the Trustee in carrying out its duties under this Section 15.01;
provided
that nothing herein shall be construed to relieve the Trustee of its duties pursuant to Section 15.01(a)(i) and Section 15.01(a)(ii) hereof.
 
 
(b)
 
In addition, if:
 
(i)
  
(A) Citizens distributes to all holders of its Common Stock rights or warrants entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days of the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such distribution) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock for the ten Trading Days immediately preceding, but not including, the date such distribution is first publicly announced by the Company, or (B) Citizens distributes to all holders of its Common Stock, cash or other assets, debt securities or rights to purchase its securities, where the Fair Market Value of such distribution per share of Common Stock exceeds 5% of the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date such distribution is first publicly announced by Citizens, then, in either case, the Notes may be surrendered for conversion at any time on and after the date that Citizens gives notice to the holders of such distribution, which shall be not less than 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Time for such distribution, until the earlier of the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding, but not including, the Ex-Dividend Time or the date Citizens publicly announces that such distribution will not take place;
provided
that if the holder will otherwise participate in such distribution without conversion (as if such holder had held a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate multiplied by 0.768), neither any adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made nor will a holder of a Note have the ability to convert pursuant to this Section 15.01(b); or
 
(ii)
  
Citizens consolidates with or merges with or into another Person or is a party to a binding share exchange or conveys, transfers, sells, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other property, then the Notes may be surrendered for conversion at any time from and after the date fifteen (15) days prior to the anticipated effective date of the transaction and ending on and including the date fifteen (15) days after the consummation of the transaction. If such transaction constitutes a Designated Event, the Notes may be surrendered for conversion until the corresponding Designated Event Repurchase Date. In such an event, a holder of Notes may elect to exercise its option to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of such holders Notes pursuant to Section 3.05. The Board of Directors shall determine the anticipated effective date of the transaction, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the holders and shall be publicly announced by the Company and posted on its web site not later than two Business Days prior to such 15
th
 day.
 
 
7
 
Ex-Dividend Time
 means, with respect to any distribution on shares of Common Stock, the first date on which the shares of Common Stock trade regular way on the principal securities market on which the shares of Common Stock are then traded without the right to receive such distribution.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 15, the proposed reclassification and conversion of the outstanding class B common stock of the Company into Common Stock in accordance with the Recapitalization Agreement (the 
Recapitalization Transaction
), will not trigger any conversion rights for any holder of Notes.
 
(c)
 
A Note in respect of which a holder is electing to exercise its option to require the Company to repurchase such holders Notes upon a Designated Event pursuant to Section 3.05, or at the option of the holder pursuant to Section 3.06, may be converted only if such holder withdraws its election in accordance with Section 3.05(c) or Section 3.08, respectively. A holder of Notes is not entitled to any rights of a holder of Common Stock until such holder has converted his Notes to Units and only to the extent such Notes are deemed to have been converted to Common Stock under this Article 15.
 
(f)
  
The third paragraph of Section 15.02 of the Base Indenture shall be amended by replacing it in its entirety with the following:
 
As promptly as practicable after satisfaction of the requirements for conversion set forth above, subject to compliance with any restrictions on transfer if shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in a name other than that of the Noteholder (as if such transfer were a transfer of the Note or Notes (or portion thereof) so converted), the Company shall deliver to such Noteholder at the office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose pursuant to Section 5.02, for each $1,000 principal amount of Note, the cash and number of full shares of Common Stock (and cash in respect of any fractional interest in respect of a share of Common Stock arising upon such conversion, calculated by the Company as provided in Section 15.03) then constituting a Unit on such Conversion Date. In case any Note of a denomination greater than $1,000 shall be surrendered for partial conversion, and subject to Section 2.03, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to him, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Note.
 
 
8
 
 
(g)
  
The seventh and eighth paragraphs of Section 15.02 of the Base Indenture shall be amended by replacing them in their entirety with the following:
 
Upon the conversion of a Note, that portion of the accrued but unpaid Interest, including accrued Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Interest, if any, to the Conversion Date, with respect to the converted Note shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the holder thereof through delivery of the cash and the Common Stock (together with the cash payment, if any in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the Note being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof; and the cash and the Fair Market Value of such shares of Common Stock (together with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) shall be treated as delivered, to the extent thereof, first in exchange for and in satisfaction of our obligation to pay the principal amount of the converted Note, the accrued but unpaid Interest, including Contingent Interest, if any, and Additional Interest, if any, through the Conversion Date and the balance, if any, of such cash and the Fair Market Value of such Common Stock (and any such cash payment) shall be treated as delivered in exchange for and in satisfaction of the right to convert the Note being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.
 
The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial interest in a Note each holder and any beneficial owner of a Note shall be deemed to have agreed to treat, for United States federal income tax purposes, the cash and the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock received upon a conversion of the Note (together with any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares) as a contingent payment on the Note for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1275-4 or any successor provision.

) attached as Exhibit A hereto, subject to adjustment as provided in this Article 15.
 
(i)

Section 15.06.

provided
that, if the kind or amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised (
non-electing share
), then for the purposes of this Section 15.06 the kind and amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance for each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 15.
 
(j)
  
Section 15.09 of the Base Indenture shall be amended by replacing it in its entirety with the following:
 
Section 15.09.
Responsibility Of Trustee.
The Trustee and any other conversion agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any holder of Notes to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other conversion agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other conversion agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company and Citizens to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company and Citizens contained in this Article 15. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 15.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 15.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 8.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
 
 
10
 
 
(k)
  
Sections 15.08, 15.10 and 15.11 of the Base Indenture shall be amended such that references to the Company shall mean Citizens.

Section 4.02.
  
Repurchase and Conversion Upon Designated Event.

Right To Convert
. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Indenture, prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding July 15, 2023, the holder of any Note shall have the right, at such holders option, to convert the principal amount of the Note, or any portion of such principal amount which is a multiple of $1,000, into cash and fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (as such shares shall then be constituted) constituting a Unit (the 
Conversion Obligation
), subject to the Companys right to elect to deliver cash or a combination of cash and Common Stock in lieu of Common Stock then constituting a portion of such Unit pursuant to Section 15.03, by surrender of the Note so to be converted in whole or in part, together with any required funds, under the circumstances described in this Section 15.01 and in the manner provided in Section 15.02. The Notes shall be convertible only upon the occurrence of one of the following events:
 
  (i)
   
   
 
during any Fiscal Quarter (and only during such Fiscal Quarters) commencing after June 30, 2005, if the Per Share Unit Value exceeds 120% of the then-effective Conversion Price for at least 20 Trading Days in the 30 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding Fiscal Quarter (it being understood for purposes of this Section 15.01(a)(i) that the Conversion Price in effect at the close of business on each of the 30 consecutive Trading Days should be used);
 
 (ii)
    
  
 
during the five Business Day period immediately following any five consecutive Trading Day period (the 
Measurement Period
) in which the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes for each day of such Measurement Period was less than 98% of the Per Note Unit Value on such date;
provided
that
no conversion pursuant to this clause
 (ii) may be made after July 15, 2018, if on any Trading Day during the Measurement Period, the Per Share Unit
Value is more than 100%, but less than 120% of the Conversion Price on such Trading Day;
 
6
 
  (iii)
   
   
 
if such Note has been called for redemption, at any time on or after the date the notice of redemption has been given until the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the redemption date; or
 
    (iv)
   
   
   
   
 
as provided in Section (b) of this Section 15.01.
 
  The Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company) shall, on behalf of the Company, determine on a daily basis during the time period specified in Section 15.01(a)(i) whether the Notes shall be convertible as a result of the occurrence of an event specified in clause (i) above and, if the Notes shall be so convertible, the Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company) shall promptly deliver to the Company and the Trustee (if the Trustee is not the conversion agent) written notice thereof. Whenever the Notes shall become convertible pursuant to this Section 15.01, the Company or, at the Companys request, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall notify the holders of the event triggering such convertibility in the manner provided in Section 16.03, and the Company shall also publicly announce such information and publish it on the Companys web site. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice.
   
   
 
  The Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company) shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price under this Section 15.01 unless the Company has requested such a determination; and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request unless a holder provides it with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes would be less than 98% of the Per Note Unit Value. If such evidence is provided, the Company shall instruct the Trustee (or other conversion agent) to determine the Trading Price of the Notes beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is greater than or equal to 98% of the Per Note Unit Value;

Section 15.03 of the Base Indenture shall be amended by replacing it in its entirety with the following:
 
Section 15.03.
  
   
   
Settlement Upon Conversion.
(a) In addition to delivering $804.84 in cash per $1,000 principal amount of Notes converted, the Company may satisfy all or any portion of the Conversion Obligation constituting Common Stock (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, the portion in cash) upon conversion of Notes in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock selected by the Company, in accordance with clause (b) and (c) of this Section 15.03.
If the Company does not elect to satisfy all or any portion of the Conversion Obligation constituting Common Stock as set forth in clause (b) and (c) below, the Company shall deliver, as soon as practicable after the third Trading Day following the related Conversion Date, for each $1,000 principal amount of Note, the cash and number of shares of Common Stock (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares)
 
then constituting a Unit on such Conversion Date.
 
  (b)
 
  
   
 
If the Company chooses to satisfy all or any portion of the Conversion Obligation constituting Common Stock in cash pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 15.03, the Company will notify the holder through the Trustee of the method chosen by the Company to satisfy the Conversion Obligation constituting Common Stock (such notice, the 
Settlement Method Election Notice
) at any time on or before the date that is two Trading Days following the Conversion Date (the 
Settlement Method Notice Period
). If the Company timely elects to pay cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares) for any portion of the shares of Common Stock then constituting the Conversion Obligation otherwise issuable to such holder, the Conversion Notice may be retracted by the holder at any time during the two Trading Day period (the 
Conversion Retraction Period
) beginning on the Trading Day after the final day of the Settlement Method Notice Period; provided that no such retraction can be made (and a Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable) if (x) the Conversion Date occurs during the period beginning on, and including, any Notice Date and ending on, and including, the redemption date specified in the related notice of redemption or (y) the Conversion Date occurs during the period beginning twenty-five scheduled Trading Days preceding the maturity date and ending one Trading Day preceding the maturity date. Settlement amounts will be computed as follows:
 
 (i)
   
   
 
If the Company elects to satisfy the entire Conversion Obligation relating to Common Stock in cash, the Company will deliver to holders surrendering Notes for conversion cash in an amount equal to the sum of the Daily Conversion Value Amounts for each of the Trading Days in the relevant Cash Settlement Averaging Period (such sum, the 
Conversion Value
); and
 
10
 (ii)
   
   
 
If the Company elects to satisfy in cash a fixed portion of the Conversion Obligation relating to Common Stock other than the entire obligation,
or a percentage of the Conversion Obligation relating to Common Stock other than 100%, the Company will deliver to holders surrendering Notes for conversion:
 
    (A)
   
   
   
   
   
 
an amount in cash equal to $804.84 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes to be converted;
 
 (B)
   
 
an amount in cash equal to either (1) the dollar amount per $1,000 principal amount of Notes to be converted that is specified in the Settlement Method Election Notice (the 
Specified Dollar Amount
) or (2) the percentage (other than 100%) of the Conversion Obligation relating to Common Stock specified in the Settlement Method Election Notice (the 
Specified Percentage
) multiplied by the sum of, for each Trading Day during the related Cash Settlement Averaging Period, and for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, 0.768 multiplied by the Conversion Rate then in effect multiplied by the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on such Trading Day, divided by 20 (such sum, the 
Stock Portion Conversion Value
); and
 
 (C)
   
 
a number of whole shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes to be converted equal to the sum of the Daily Share Amounts for each of the Trading Days in the relevant Cash Settlement Averaging Period (provided that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 15.04).
 
Settlement pursuant to Sections 15.03(b)( i) and 15.03(b)(ii) will occur on the third Trading Day following the final Trading Day of the relevant Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
 
(c)
  
   
   
 
Notwithstanding the procedures set forth in Section 15.03(b), in the event that a Conversion Date occurs on or following the twenty-fifth scheduled Trading Day prior to July 15, 2023 (the 
Final Notice Date
) or during the period beginning on, and including, any Notice Date and ending on, and including, the redemption date specified in the related notice of redemption, the Company will not be required to send individual Settlement Method Election Notices. Instead, if the Company chooses to satisfy all or any portion of the Conversion Obligation constituting Common Stock in cash with respect to Conversion Dates occurring on or after the Final Notice Date or with respect to Conversion Dates occurring during the period beginning on, and including, any Notice Date and ending on, and including, the redemption date specified in the related notice of redemption, the Company must send a single Settlement Method Election Notice to the Trustee on the Final Notice Date with respect to any Conversion Dates occurring on or after the Final Notice Date or on any Notice Date with respect to any Conversion Dates occurring during the period beginning on, and including, such Notice Date and ending on and including, the redemption date specified in the related notice of
redemption. Settlement amounts will be computed in the same manner as set forth under Section 15.03(b) above.

election shall not have been exercised (non-electing share), then for the purposes of this Section 15.07 the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance for each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares).
 
Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 15.

  (ii)
   
   
 
For purposes of the foregoing, 
Exchange Property Value
 means the sum of the Daily Conversion Value Amounts for each of the Trading Days in the relevant Cash Settlement Averaging Period determined as set forth in the definition of Daily Conversion Value Amount, except that for purposes of determining the Exchange Property Value, the Daily Conversion Value Amount shall mean, for each Trading Day during relevant Cash Settlement Averaging Period and for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, an amount equal to the product of (i) 1/20 and (ii) the value of cash, securities and other property constituting the Exchange Property determined as follows:
 
 (A)
   
 
Any shares of common stock of the successor or purchasing corporation or any other corporation that are included in the Exchange Property shall be valued as set forth in Section 15.03 using the procedures set forth in the definition of Closing Sale Price in Section 1.01; and

the Company in a manner determined by the Company consistent with Section 15.03(b)(ii) hereof and this Section 15.07.

The Trustee and any other conversion agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any holder of Notes to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other conversion agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other conversion agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company and Citizens to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company and Citizens contained in this Article 15.

For the avoidance of doubt, effective as of the date hereof, the Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted upon the occurrence of an event with respect to the Company which would have required an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 15.06 of the Base Indenture if such event had occurred prior to the date hereof.

Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.

Conversion Notice
 on the reverse thereof duly completed, to the Company at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, or at the option of such holder, the Corporate Trust Office, and, unless the shares, if any, and cash issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as this Note, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the holder or by his duly authorized attorney. The Company will notify the holder thereof of any event triggering the right to convert the Notes as specified above in accordance with the Indenture.
 
  No adjustment in respect of interest on any Note converted or dividends on any shares issued upon conversion of such Note will be made upon any conversion except as set forth in the next sentence.

provided
that no such payment shall be required (1) if the Company has specified a redemption date that is after a record date and prior to the next interest payment date, (2) if the Company has specified a Designated Event Repurchase Date that is during such period or (3) to the extent of any overdue Interest, if any overdue interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Note.
 
  No fractional shares will be issued upon any conversion, but an adjustment and payment in cash will be made, as provided in the Indenture, in respect of any fraction of a share which would otherwise be issuable upon the surrender of any Note or Notes for conversion.
   
   
 
  A Note in respect of which a holder is exercising its right to require repurchase upon a Designated Event or repurchase on a Repurchase Date may be converted only if such holder withdraws its election to exercise either such right in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
   
   
 
28
 
 
  Any Notes called for redemption, unless surrendered for conversion by the holders thereof on or before the close of business on the Business Day preceding the redemption date, may be deemed to be redeemed from the holders of such Notes for an amount equal to the applicable redemption price, together with accrued but unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, by one or more investment banks or other purchasers who may agree with the Company (i) to purchase such Notes from the holders thereof and convert them in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and (ii) to make payment for such Notes as aforesaid to the Trustee in trust for the holders.
   
   
 
  Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange thereof, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.

All payments made to or upon the order of such registered holder shall, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, satisfy and discharge liability for monies payable on this Note.
   
   
 
  No recourse for the payment of the principal of or Interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in the Indenture or any supplemental indenture or in any Note, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, employee, agent, officer or director or subsidiary, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

SECTION 2.01.
   
Commitments.
 
(a) 
   
Term Loan
.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, to make a term loan (the 
Term Loan
) to the Borrower in Dollars, on the Effective Date in an amount not to exceed such Lenders Commitment, in each case in accordance with
Section 2.04
. The Term Loan may be Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans, as determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with
Sections 2.04
and
2.05
. Amounts repaid or prepaid in respect of the Term Loan may not be reborrowed.
 
Each Lenders Commitment is set forth opposite its respective name in
Schedule 2.01
. Such Commitment may be reduced from time to time pursuant to
Section 2.11
and Section 
2.13(f)

SECTION 2.02.
   
Loans.
 
(a) 
   
Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their Commitments;
provided, however
, that the failure of any Lender to make any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender). The Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.
 
(b) 
   
Each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans, as the Borrower may request pursuant to
Section 2.04
. Each Lender may at its option make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;
provided
that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time;
provided, however
, that the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing which, if made, would result in an aggregate of more than five separate Loans of any Lender being outstanding hereunder at any one time. For purposes of the foregoing, Loans having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Loans.
 
(c) 
   
Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Office, not later than 1:00 P.M., and the Administrative Agent shall by 3:00 P.M. credit the amounts so received to an account specified by the Borrower or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders. Each Loan shall be made by the Lenders
pro rata
in accordance with
Section 2.16
.
 
(d) 
   
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Interest Period requested by the Borrower with respect to any Borrowing shall not end after the Maturity Date.

SECTION 2.04.
   
Borrowing Procedure.
 
In order to request a Borrowing (other than a Conversion), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy to the Administrative Agent a notice in the form of
Exhibit A
(a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 A.M. three Business Days before a proposed Borrowing, and (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 A.M. on the day of a proposed Borrowing. Such notice shall be irrevocable (unless otherwise expressly provided herein) and shall in each case specify (i) whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day) and the amount thereof; and (iii) if such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration. The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise (but in any event no later than 12:00 P.M. on such date) the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this
Section 2.04
and of each Lenders portion of the requested Borrowing.
 
 
SECTION 2.05.
   
Conversions.
 
The Borrower may from time to time Convert any Loan (or portion thereof) of any Type and with any Interest Period (if applicable) to one or more Loans of the same or any other Type and with any Interest Period (if applicable) by delivering (by hand delivery or telecopier) a request for such Conversion in the form of
Exhibit B
to the Administrative Agent no later than (i) 11:00 A.M. on the third Business Day prior to the date of any proposed Conversion into a Eurodollar Loan and (ii) 11:00 A.M., on the day of any proposed Conversion into an ABR Loan. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of each Conversion Request. Each Conversion Request shall be irrevocable (unless otherwise expressly provided herein) and binding on the Borrower and shall specify the requested (A) date of such Conversion, (B) Type of, and Interest Period, if any, applicable to, the Loans (or portions thereof) proposed to be Converted, (C) Type of Loans to which such Loans (or portions thereof) are proposed to be Converted, (D) initial Interest Period, if any, to be applicable to the Loans resulting from such Conversion and (E) aggregate amount of Loans (or portions thereof) proposed to be Converted. No Eurodollar Loans may be Converted on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, unless the Borrower reimburses each Lender pursuant to
Section 2.15
for all losses or expenses incurred by such Lender in connection with such Conversion. If the Borrower shall fail to give a timely Conversion Request pursuant to this subsection in respect of any Loans, such Loans shall, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, automatically Convert into, or remain as, as the case may be, ABR Loans, unless such Loans are repaid at the end of such Interest Period. If the Borrower shall fail, in any Conversion Request that has been timely given, to select the duration of any Interest Period for Loans to be Converted into Eurodollar Loans, such Loans shall, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, automatically Convert into Eurodollar Loans with an Interest Period of one months duration. If, on the date of any proposed Conversion, the Borrower shall have failed to fulfill any condition set forth in
Section 4.01
, all Loans then outstanding shall, on such date, automatically Convert into, or remain as, as the case may be, ABR Loans.

(a) 
   
The outstanding principal balance of each Loan shall be payable on the Maturity Date. Each Loan shall bear interest from the date thereof on the outstanding principal balance thereof as set forth in
Section 2.08
. Each Lender shall, and is hereby authorized by the Borrower to record in such Lenders internal records an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each Loan of such Lender, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Loan, and such other relevant information as such Lender records in its internal records with respect to loans of a type similar to such Loans;
provided, however
, that the failure of any Lender to make such a notation or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans, made by such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
(b) 
   
Any Lender may request that any Loans made by it be evidenced by one or more promissory notes. Promptly upon receipt of such request, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender one or more promissory notes payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its assignees) substantially in the form of
Exhibit D
. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory notes and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to
Section 9.04
) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein.
 
 
SECTION 2.08.
   
Interest on Loans.
 
(a) 
   
Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.09
, the Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate
per annum
equal to the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus
the Applicable Rate. Interest on each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be payable on each applicable Interest Payment Date. The LIBO Rate for each Interest Period shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall promptly (but in any event no later than 10:30 A.M. two Business Days prior to the commencement of such Interest Period) (A) advise the Borrower and each Lender, as appropriate, of such determination and (B) upon the request of the Borrower, provide the Borrower with the calculations and relevant factors supporting such determination.
 
(b) 
   
Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.09
, the Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, when determined with reference to clause (b) of the definition of Alternate Base Rate and over a year of 360 days in all other cases) at a rate
per annum
equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. Interest on each ABR Borrowing shall be payable on each applicable Interest Payment Date. The Alternate Base Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall promptly (but in any event no later than 11:30 A.M. on the day of each ABR Borrowing) (A) advise the Borrower and each Lender of such determination and (B) upon the request of the Borrower, provide the Borrower with the calculations and relevant factors supporting such determination.

Default Interest.
 
If the Borrower shall default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming due hereunder, whether by scheduled maturity, notice of prepayment, acceleration, or otherwise, the Borrower shall on demand from time to time from the Administrative Agent pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such defaulted amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as well as before judgment) at a rate

plus
2%.
 
 
SECTION 2.10.
   
Alternate Rate of Interest.
 
In the event, and on each occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the Administrative Agent shall have determined that dollar deposits in the principal amounts of the Eurodollar Loans comprising such Borrowing are not generally available in the London interbank market, or that the rates at which such dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loan during such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give written notice of such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing pursuant to
Section 2.04
shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing (unless the Borrower shall have withdrawn its request for such Eurodollar Borrowing not later than 10:00 A.M. on the day of the proposed Borrowing) and (ii) any request by the Borrower for a Conversion to Eurodollar Loans pursuant to
Section 2.05
shall be deemed to be a request for a Conversion to ABR Loans (unless the Borrower shall have withdrawn its request for such Conversion not later than 10:00 A.M. on the day of the proposed Conversion).

(b) 
   
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation D) or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of the principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender or any Fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other than changes in respect of taxes imposed on the overall net income of such Lender and franchise taxes imposed on it by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal office or by any political subdivision or taxing authority therein), or shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of or credit extended by such Lender, or shall impose on such Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest, or otherwise) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, to the extent not otherwise being reimbursed under
Section 2.19

(a) 
   
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may:
 
(i) 
   
declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by such Lender hereunder, and any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan (or for a Conversion thereto pursuant to
Section 2.05
) unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
 
(ii) 
   
require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be Converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically Converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.
 
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the Converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the Conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

or
2.05
, (c) any payment, prepayment or Conversion of a Eurodollar Loan required by any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed made on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) any default in payment or prepayment of the principal amount of any Loan or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when due and payable (at the due date thereof, whether by scheduled maturity, acceleration, irrevocable notice of prepayment or otherwise), or (e) the occurrence of any Event of Default, including, in each such case, any loss or reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a Eurodollar Loan. Such loss or reasonable expense shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably demonstrated by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, Converted, or not borrowed (assumed to be the LIBO Rate) for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, or failure to borrow to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably demonstrated by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in redeploying the funds so paid, prepaid, or not borrowed for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be. A certificate of any Lender setting forth the factors and calculations supporting any amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower no later than 30 days following the incurrence of any loss or expense for which such Lender is seeking indemnification under this

SECTION 2.17
   
Sharing of Setoffs.

or counterclaim or other event;
provided, however
, that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this
Section 2.17
and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any Lender holding a participation in a Loan deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of bankers lien, setoff, or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.18
   
Payments; Administrative Agents Clawback.
 
(a) 
   
The Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder not later than 12:00 P.M. on the date when due in Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Office in immediately available funds. All payments by the Borrower shall be made without deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
 
(b) 
   
Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.
 
(c) 
   
(i) 
   
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing (or in the case of any Borrowings consisting of ABR Loans, prior to 1:00 P.M. on the proposed date of such ABR Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.02
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection
(c)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

Taxes
). If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the Lenders (or any Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased by the amount necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 2.19
) such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) shall receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law;
provided, however
, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender or the Administrative Agent with respect to any withholding tax that is imposed or amounts payable to any Lender or the Administrative Agent at the time such Lender or Administrative Agent becomes a party to this Agreement (or designates a new lending office).
 
(b) 
   
In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges, or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery, or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as 
Other Taxes
);
 
(c) 
   
The Borrower will indemnify each Lender (or Transferee) and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.19
) paid by such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted by the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority. Payment of such indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date any Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, makes written demand therefor. If any Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent determines in its sole discretion (exercised in good faith) that it has received a refund in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes for which such
 
 
22
Table of Contents
 
 
Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent has received payment from the Borrower hereunder, it shall promptly notify the Borrower of such refund and shall, within 15 days after receipt of such refund, repay such refund to the Borrower, net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including taxes) of such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and only with interest received, if any, from the relevant taxing authority or Governmental Authority;
provided
that the Borrower, upon the request of such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, agrees to return such refund (plus penalties, interest, or other charges) to such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the event such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund; provided further that nothing in this
Section 2.19
shall obligate any Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent to apply for any such refund. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
 
(d) 
   
Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes withheld by the Borrower in respect of any payment to any Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in
Section 9.01
, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
 
(e) 
   
Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this
Section 2.19
shall survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans made hereunder.
 
(f) 
   
Each Lender represents and warrants that either (i) it is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction within the United States or (ii) it has delivered to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent duly completed copies of such form or forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service indicating that such Lender is entitled to receive payments without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, as permitted by the Code. Each Transferee agrees that, on or prior to the date upon which it shall become a party hereto or obtain a participation herein, and upon the reasonable request from time to time of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, it will deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent either (A) a statement that it is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction within the United States or (B) duly completed copies of such form or forms as may from time to time be prescribed by the United States Internal Revenue Service, indicating that such Transferee is entitled to receive payments without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, as permitted by the Code. Each Lender that has delivered, and each Transferee that hereafter delivers, to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent the form or forms referred to in the two preceding sentences further undertakes to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, so far as it may legally do so, further copies of such form or forms, or successor applicable form or forms, as the case may be, as and when any previous form filed by it hereunder shall expire or shall become incomplete or inaccurate in any respect.
 
(g) 
   
The Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amounts to any Lender (or Transferee) in respect of United States withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) above if the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Lender (or Transferee) to comply with the provisions of paragraph (f) above, unless such failure results from (i) a change in applicable law, regulation, or official interpretation thereof, or (ii) an amendment, modification, or revocation of any applicable tax treaty or a change in official position regarding the application or interpretation thereof, in each case after the date hereof (and, in the case of a Transferee, after the date of assignment or transfer);
provided, however
, that the Borrower shall be required to pay those amounts to any Lender (or Transferee) which it was required to pay hereunder prior to the failure of such Lender (or Transferee) to comply with the provisions of paragraph
(f)
.

Section 2.19
shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document requested by the Borrower or to change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a filing or change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender (or Transferee), be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee).
 
(i) 
   
If any Lender shall request compensation under this
Section 2.19
, the Borrower shall have the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, to require such Lender to (i) terminate its Commitment or (ii) transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04
but with the assignment fee in such instance to be paid by the Borrower) all or a portion of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to another financial institution which shall assume such obligations;
provided that
(A) no such termination or assignment shall conflict with any law, rule, or regulation or order of any Governmental Authority and (B) the Borrower or the assignee, as the case may be, shall pay to the affected Lender in immediately available funds on the date of such termination or assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder.

The Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (b) to promptly give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Borrower of any Event of Default specified in this Agreement of which the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement as received by the Administrative Agent.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees, or agents shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by any of them, except for its or his own gross negligence or willful misconduct, or be responsible for any statement, warranty, or representation herein or the contents of any document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of the terms, conditions, covenants, or agreements contained herein. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to the Lenders or any Transferee for the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability, or effectiveness of this Agreement or any other instruments or agreements. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat each Lender party hereto as a Lender hereunder and for all purposes hereof until it shall have received notice, given as provided herein, of the assignment of all of such Lenders rights and obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders (or such other number of Lenders as is expressly required hereby with respect to such action or inaction) and, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, such instructions and any action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders and each Transferee. The Administrative Agent shall, in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on any instrument or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees, or agents shall have any responsibility to the Borrower on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any Lender of any of its obligations hereunder or to any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any other Lender or the Borrower of any of their respective obligations hereunder or in connection herewith. The Administrative Agent may execute any and all duties hereunder by or through agents or employees and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of legal counsel selected by it with respect to all matters arising hereunder and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel.

The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower,
provided, however,
such resignation shall not become effective until a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed as set forth below. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agents giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, selected from among the Lenders. In either case, such appointment shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Borrower (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld and shall not be required upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to, and become vested with, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Prior to any retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary to assign to the successor Administrative Agent its rights as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents. After such resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to have the benefit of this

pro rata
share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, cost, expenses, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against it in its capacity as the Administrative Agent or any of them in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by it or any of them under this Agreement, to the extent the same shall not have been indemnified by the Borrower;
provided
that no Lender shall be liable to the Administrative Agent or any of them for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees, or agents.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
