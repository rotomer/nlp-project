Exhibit 99.1 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 Web site: www.czn.net Contact: Brigid Smith 203.614.5042 bsmith@czn.com Citizens Communications Reports 2007 First-Quarter Results Stamford, Conn., May 2, 2007 -- Citizens Communications (NYSE:CZN) today reported first quarter 2007 revenues of $556.1 million, operating income of $193.3 million, and net income of $67.7 million. First quarter 2007 revenue was $556.1 million, as compared to $506.9 million in the first quarter of 2006. First quarter 2007 results include revenues of $20.7 million related to the operations of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises, since the date of acquisition on March 8, 2007. Revenues, excluding the acquired property, were up 5.6 percent as compared to the same period last year due to higher access, data and internet services, partially offset by declines in local services. Access revenues were significantly higher in the first quarter of 2007 as compared to 2006 due to the settlement of a switched access dispute with a favorable impact of $38.7 million offset by declines in other access service revenues (which include subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies). The Company experienced 13.8 percent growth in data and internet services revenue in the first quarter of 2007, compared to the first quarter of 2006. First quarter 2007 other operating expenses were $186.5 million, as compared to $184.6 million in the first quarter of 2006. Excluding the expense increase due to the acquisition, the company's other operating expenses for the first quarter of 2007 decreased by approximately $8.2 million or 4.4 percent, as compared to the first quarter of 2006 primarily driven by reductions in employees and improved expense control in benefit costs. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of 2007 was $122.2 million, as compared to $122.0 million in the first quarter of 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of 2007, excluding the impact of the acquisition, decreased $6.7 million or 5.5 percent as compared to the first quarter of 2006. The decrease is primarily due to a declining net asset base. The Company added approximately 70,800 high-speed internet customers during the quarter reflecting 20,300 from the base Citizens property and 50,500 from the acquired Commonwealth property, and had more than 464,000 high-speed data subscribers at March 31, 2007. -MORE-
Operating income for the first quarter of 2007 was $193.3 million and operating income margin was 34.8 percent, compared to $157.3 million and 31.0 percent in the first quarter of 2006. Capital expenditures were $45.1 million for the first quarter of 2007, including $4.3 million related to the acquired property. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $187.6 million. The company's dividend represents a payout of 46 percent of free cash flow for the first quarter. During the first quarter, the Company repurchased 823,000 shares of its common stock for $12.0 million. "We are off to a good start with strong first quarter results. Product revenue growth coupled with disciplined expense control generated a 56.7% operating cash flow margin and our focus on the customer drove penetration levels for all voice, data and video product bundles," said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman and CEO of Citizens. "We are very excited about completing the Commonwealth acquisition and full integration of these Pennsylvania properties is now underway." Outlook - ------- As a result of the favorable settlement dispute and the successful closing of the merger transaction with Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises on March 8, 2007, the Company is revising its 2007 guidance. We now expect to spend between $315 million and $325 million in capital expenditures in 2007. Free cash flow for 2007 is now estimated to be between $500 million and $520 million. The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow and operating cash flow. A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The company believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions, and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations and its divisions' measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the company believes that free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. --MORE --
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. While the company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure. Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures. The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance. Words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements (including oral representations) involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. These risks and uncertainties are based on a number of factors, including but not limited to: our ability to successfully integrate Commonwealth's operations and to realize the synergies from the acquisition; our ability to effectively manage our operations, costs and capital spending; our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including bundled service packages; our ability to sell enhanced services; our ability to comply with federal and state regulations; changes in the number of our revenue generating units; general and local economic and employment conditions; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; overall changes in the telecommunications market; and greater than anticipated competition from wireless or wireline carriers. These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the foregoing information should be read in conjunction with these filings. We do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of future events or circumstances. ### TABLES TO FOLLOW
