Item 8.01 Other Events ------------ On July 17, 2007, Citizens Communications Company announced the next phase of its Customer Operations Strategy for its Frontier operations to close its Rochester, New York Residential Call Center and Credit and Collections Center. Some of the Residential Call Center employees will be offered to participate in the Company's Work-At-Home Program, subject to negotiation with UNITEHERE, the local union. The Credit and Collections Center will be consolidated into Frontier's other Credit and Collections operations. The Rochester Internet Help Desk, Operator Services Centers and Carrier Support Group will not be affected. In addition, on July 20, 2007, approximately 50 of the Company's field technicians in the Rochester region elected to participate in an early retirement program. The Company estimates that over 100 employees will be impacted by these two initiatives. The Company is unable to make a determination of an estimate of the third quarter charges it will incur in connection with these actions at this time. The Company previously announced the closing of several other call centers during the fourth quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, including in Gloversville and Monroe, New York, Kingman, Arizona and New Richmond, Wisconsin. The Company did not incur material charges in connection with the closing of those call centers.
