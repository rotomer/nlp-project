Approximately 120 positions will be eliminated as part of the Company's National Call Center Consolidation Strategy, most of which will be filled by new employees at the Company's other call centers. In addition, approximately 50 field operations employees have agreed to participate in an early retirement program and another 30 employees from a variety of functions will also be leaving the Company. The Company anticipates that these workforce reductions will result in annualized savings in excess of $7 million. The charge and the annualized savings also include amounts attributable to an executive's previously announced departure from the Company.
