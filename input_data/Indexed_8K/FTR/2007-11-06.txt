Exhibit 99.1 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 Web site: www.czn.net Contact: David Whitehouse Senior Vice President & Treasurer 203.614.5708 david.whitehouse@czn.com Citizens Communications Reports 2007 Third-Quarter Results * Revenues up 13.5% year over year * Continued strong operating income and cash flow margins * 17,900 high speed internet additions * 5,400 Dish Network video additions * Year-to-date dividend payout ratio of 60.1% * $250 million stock repurchase program completed * 2007 Free cash flow and capital spending expectations unchanged Stamford, Conn., November 6, 2007 -- Citizens Communications (NYSE:CZN) today reported third quarter 2007 revenues of $575.8 million, operating income of $165.9 million, and net income of $47.4 million. Third quarter 2007 results include a previously announced charge of approximately $12.1 million for severance and early retirement costs primarily related to ongoing initiatives to enhance customer service, streamline operations and reduce costs. This compares to severance and early retirement costs in the third quarter of 2006 of $0.5 million. "We delivered another quarter of strong financial results," said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman and CEO of Citizens. "Continued customer product revenue growth along with disciplined expense control, realized synergies on our Commonwealth acquisition and other expense reduction initiatives generated a 52.8 percent operating cash flow margin. Excluding the $12.1 million severance and early retirement costs, our third quarter operating cash flow margin for the quarter would have been 54.9 percent. Our penetration levels increased on all bundled products. Our residential high speed penetration is 30 percent and high speed revenues continue to be over $40.00 per customer per month. Our wireless data initiative is now operating in nine municipalities, four colleges and universities and over 20 hot spots in our territory. We are also excited about our recently closed acquisition of Global Valley and remain confident in delivering on our results for the remainder of the year." Revenue for the third quarter of 2007 was $575.8 million, as compared to $507.2 million in the third quarter of 2006, a 13.5 percent increase. The third quarter 2007 increase of $68.6 million is primarily a result of $80.5 million of revenues related to the operations of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises, which was acquired on March 8, 2007, and a $13.1 million increase in data and internet services revenue, offset by declines in Federal and state subsidies and lower local services revenues resulting from reduced access lines.
Other operating expenses for the third quarter of 2007 were $215.3 million, as compared to $186.7 million in the third quarter of 2006, a 15.3 percent increase. The third quarter 2007 increase of $28.6 million is primarily a result of $23.8 million in other operating expenses related to the operations of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises and the incremental charge for severance and early retirement costs, offset by lower compensation and benefit costs resulting from reduced number of employees and improved expense controls. The purchase of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises has enabled the Company to leverage its centralized back office, customer service and administrative support functions over a larger asset base. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of 2007 was $138.1 million, as compared to $117.0 million in the third quarter of 2006, an 18 percent increase. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of 2007, excluding the impact of the acquisition, decreased $5.8 million or 5.0 percent as compared to the third quarter of 2006. The decrease is primarily due to a declining net asset base. The Company added approximately 17,900 high-speed internet customers during the third quarter of 2007 and had more than 497,200 high-speed internet customers at September 30, 2007. The Company added approximately 5,400 video customers during the third quarter of 2007 and had more than 86,400 video customers at September 30, 2007. Operating income for the third quarter of 2007 was $165.9 million and operating income margin was 28.8 percent, as compared to operating income of $160.7 million and operating income margin of 31.7 percent in the third quarter of 2006. The third quarter 2007 increase of $5.2 million is primarily a result of $18.9 million related to the operations of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises and $5.8 million from a reduction in depreciation and amortization, offset by the incremental charge for severance and early retirement costs. Third quarter 2007 income from continuing operations and net income was $47.4 million as compared to third quarter 2006 income from continuing operations of $51.3 million and net income of $128.5 million. Excluding the severance and early retirement costs of $12.1 million and $0.5 million from third quarter 2007 and 2006, respectively, and excluding the income from discontinued operations in 2006, income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2007 and 2006 would have been $54.9 million and $51.6 million, respectively. Capital expenditures were $90.9 million for the third quarter of 2007 and $202.6 million for the first nine months of 2007, including $24.2 million related to the acquired property since the date of acquisition. Free cash flow was $118.9 million for the third quarter of 2007 and $422.7 million for the first nine months of 2007. The Company's dividend represents a payout of 60.1 percent of free cash flow for the first nine months of 2007. -MORE-
During the third quarter, the Company repurchased 10,472,000 shares of its common stock for $148.4 million. The Company completed its $250.0 million authorized stock repurchase program in mid-October 2007. In addition, during the third quarter, the Company redeemed $30.4 million principal amount of its industrial development revenue bonds. The Company continues to expect that its capital expenditures and free cash flow for the full year 2007 will be approximately $315 million to $325 million and approximately $500 million to $520 million, respectively. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow and operating cash flow. A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions, and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations, and its divisions measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude the $12.1 million and $0.5 million of severance and early retirement costs in the third quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively, because the Company believes that the magnitude of such costs in the third quarter of 2007 materially exceeds that which has been incurred by the Company in any other quarter during 2006 and 2007. The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude the effects of the acquisition of Commonwealth because of the magnitude of the acquisition and its impact on the Company's financial results in 2007. -MORE-
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. While the Company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure. Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.
