Exhibit 99.1 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 Web site: www.czn.net Contact: David Whitehouse Senior Vice President & Treasurer 203.614.5708 david.whitehouse@czn.com - ------------------------ Citizens Communications Reports 2007 Fourth-Quarter Results; Announces New Stock Repurchase Program * Revenue up 14% year over year * Continued strong operating income and cash flow margins * 2007 free cash flow of $528 million * Year-to-date dividend payout ratio of 64% * 22,400 high speed internet additions * Global Valley acquisition completed (15,300 access lines) * $200 million stock repurchase program announced Stamford, Conn., February 26, 2008 -- Citizens Communications (NYSE:CZN) today reported fourth quarter 2007 revenue of $577.2 million, operating income of $174.9 million, and net income of $59.0 million. "We delivered another quarter of strong financial and operating results," said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman and CEO of Citizens. "Continued customer product revenue growth along with disciplined expense control, realized synergies on our Commonwealth acquisition and other expense reduction initiatives generated a 55.4 percent operating cash flow margin. Our penetration levels increased on all bundled products as our fourth quarter promotions drove residential high speed penetration to 32 percent and high speed revenues continue to be over $40.00 per customer per month. Our wireless data roll-out is now up and running in 13 municipalities, four colleges and universities and over 50 hot spots in our territory. Finally, our integration of Global Valley Networks is well underway." Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $577.2 million, as compared to $504.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, a 14 percent increase. The fourth quarter 2007 increase of $72.8 million is primarily the result of $82.4 million of revenues contributed by the operations of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises, which was acquired on March 8, 2007, and Global Valley, which was acquired on October 31, 2007, and a $15.8 million increase in data and internet services revenue, offset by declines in Federal and state subsidies and a decline in basic access lines.
Other operating expenses and network access expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $257.2 million, as compared to $229.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, a 12 percent increase. The fourth quarter 2007 increase of $27.7 million is primarily the result of $20.7 million in expenses attributable to the acquired operations of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises and Global Valley ($35.1 million excluding the impact of a pension curtailment gain of $14.4 million, resulting from the freeze placed on certain pension benefits of the former Commonwealth employees). The purchases of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises and Global Valley have enabled the Company to leverage its centralized back office, customer service and administrative support functions over a larger customer base. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $174.9 million and operating income margin was 30.3 percent, as compared to operating income of $157.0 million and operating income margin of 31.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. The fourth quarter 2007 increase of $17.9 million is primarily the result of $32.2 million contributed by the acquired operations of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises and Global Valley, partially offset by increases in network access expenses and a reduction in revenue. The Company added approximately 22,400 high-speed internet customers during the fourth quarter of 2007 and had more than 523,800 high-speed internet customers at December 31, 2007. The Company added approximately 9,400 video customers during the fourth quarter of 2007 and had more than 93,500 video customers at December 31, 2007. These fourth quarter net additions to high-speed internet and video customers exclude the impact of the Global Valley acquisition. The Global Valley acquisition was completed on October 31, 2007. Global Valley represents $2.3 million of revenue for the two months in the quarter, 15,300 access lines and 4,200 high-speed internet customers. Capital expenditures were $113.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and $315.8 million for the year, including $34.3 million related to the acquired properties since the date of their respective acquisitions. Free cash flow was $105.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and $528.0 million for the year. The Company's $1 per common share annual dividend represents a payout of 64 percent of free cash flow for the year. During the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 2,175,000 shares of its common stock for $30.9 million and completed its $250.0 million authorized stock repurchase program. The Company's Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock share repurchase program. Under the new program, up to $200 million of common stock may be repurchased over the next 12 months. The Company expects that its capital expenditures and free cash flow for the full year 2008 will be approximately $300 million to $310 million and approximately $450 million to $475 million, respectively. The Company's 2008 free cash flow expectations take into consideration an estimate of cash taxes in the range of $130 million to $140 million. The Company's 2008 cash tax estimate does not reflect the impact of the "Economic Stimulus Act of 2008," which the Company is currently evaluating. -MORE-
The Company's next regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on March 31, 2008 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2008. The Company expects that dividends paid to stockholders in 2008 will be treated as dividends for federal income tax purposes. Shareholders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow and operating cash flow. A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions, and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations, and its divisions measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude $14.4 million in pension curtailment gain in the fourth quarter and full year of 2007, and $3.2 million of severance and early retirement costs in the fourth quarter of 2006, and severance and early retirement costs of $13.9 million for the full year of 2007 and $7.2 million for the full year 2006, because the Company believes that the magnitude of such gains and costs in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 materially exceeds that which has been incurred by the Company in any other quarter during 2006 and 2007. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. -MORE-
While the Company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure. Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.

Forward-looking statements (including oral representations) involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements.

These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the foregoing information should be read in conjunction with these filings. We do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of future events or circumstances. ### TABLES TO FOLLOW
