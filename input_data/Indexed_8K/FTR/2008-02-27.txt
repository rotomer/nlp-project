Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; -------------------------------------------------------------------- Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of --------------------------------------------------------------- Certain Officers. ----------------- On February 21, 2008, the Company's Compensation Committee (the "Committee") approved the performance criteria for the Company's named executive officers and three other senior executive officers of the Company (collectively constituting its Senior Leadership Team) under the Citizens Incentive Plan and the Equity Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2008. The Committee also assigned target amounts of incentive compensation for each member of the Senior Leadership Team. The Committee determined that the cash incentive awards to the members of the Senior Leadership Team under the Citizens Incentive Plan would be based upon the achievement of specific goals that relate to the Company's "3Ps" - people, products and profitability. For 2008, the profit goals include targets for revenue, EBITDA, capital expenditures, operating free cash flow, customer retention and integration of recent acquisitions. The product goals include the implementation of critical operational plans and achieving sales targets for High Speed Broadband, Frontier product packages, internet services and wireless products. The profit and product goals are weighted at 85%. The people goals are part of the executive's individual leadership component which is weighted at 15% The actual bonuses payable for fiscal year 2008 (if any) will vary depending on the extent to which actual performances meet, exceed, or fall short of the goals and criteria set by the Committee but will not exceed 120% of target. The Committee determined that the restricted share awards to these executive officers under the Equity Incentive Plan would be based upon the achievement of specific goals that relate to the Company's revenue, EBITDA and operating free cash flow. The plan requires that the Company achieve 90% of these financial targets in order for any restricted share awards to be granted. The actual restricted share awards for fiscal year 2008 (if any) will vary depending on individual performance. The Committee also approved base salary merit increases, cash bonuses for 2007 and restricted stock grants for each of the Company's current named executive officers. See Exhibit 99.1, which is incorporated herein by reference. On February 21, 2008, Donald R. Shassian, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, was appointed as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Item 8.01.
