Exhibit 99.1 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 www.czn.com - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact David Whitehouse Senior Vice President & Treasurer 203.614.5708 Citizens Communications Consolidates Billing Systems; Achieves Major Triple-Play Milestone - 100,000 DISH Network Customers Stamford, Conn., April 17, 2008 -- Citizens Communications Company (NYSE:CZN) announced today that it successfully completed the first of two billing system conversions consolidating more than 465,000 customers into the Company's primary billing platform. The primary Citizens billing system now supports approximately 2 million access lines. This significant undertaking enhances the billing and customer care capabilities for 64 markets and included consolidation of plant, inventory and repair functions. Citizens now has just two billing systems and the remaining system conversion covering 400,000 access lines, is scheduled for completion later this year. Commenting on the conversion, CEO Maggie Wilderotter said, "The benefits of these conversions are very significant. In addition to lowering the cost of operations through business process standardization, there will be a meaningful positive effect on customer service. Our customers will have a new simplified bill format that is greatly improved over the previous version. The bill was designed with customer input, has multiple color capability and enhanced messaging. These information system consolidations also allow our customer care representatives to be even more effective at selling our products and delivering a great customer experience." The Company also announced the sign up of its 100,000th DISH Network Satellite TV(R) customer. The Company's partnership with DISH Network provides several all-digital television packages ranging from 40 to 250 channels. These video packages are added to telephone and broadband services sold and provided by Citizens. The customer receives a discount for taking all three voice video and data services and Citizens provides the customer service, billing and front line support for these products. "Reaching our 100,000th DISH customer in just three years is a major milestone for Citizens. We have a solid partnership with DISH Network and our customers who take all three services - the "Triple Play" - have significantly lower churn than all other product offers. " said Ms. Wilderotter. -More-
