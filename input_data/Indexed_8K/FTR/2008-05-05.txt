Exhibit 99.1 Citizens Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 Web site: www.czn.com Contact: David Whitehouse Senior Vice President & Treasurer 203.614.5708 david.whitehouse@czn.com Citizens Communications Reports Solid 2008 First-Quarter Results * Data and internet services revenue up 24% year over year * 20,200 high speed internet additions * Continued strong operating income and cash flow margins * 2008 free cash flow guidance increased * First quarter dividend payout ratio of 48% * Dish Network video customers exceed 100,000 Stamford, Conn., May 5, 2008 -- Citizens Communications (NYSE:CZN) today reported first quarter 2008 revenue of $569.2 million, operating income of $164.3 million, and net income of $45.6 million. "Citizens Communications had solid financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2008," said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman and CEO. "Our first quarter performance is a direct result of our ongoing primary focus on keeping customers, upgrading them to new products and services and putting new customers on service. As a result of continued effective expense management we achieved an operating cash flow margin of 53.7%. Adjusted to exclude severance and early retirement costs, our operating cash flow margin would have been 54.2%. We continue to build on our successful promotional initiatives to increase the penetration of High- Speed Internet and other bundled product offerings, including the roll-out of our "Peace of Mind" product suite." Revenue for the first quarter of 2008 was $569.2 million, as compared to $556.1 million in the first quarter of 2007, a 2 percent increase. The 2008 period includes $62.0 million of additional revenues in the aggregate contributed by the operations of Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises, which was acquired on March 8, 2007, and Global Valley Networks, which was acquired on October 31, 2007. The 2007 period includes the favorable one-time impact to access revenues of $38.7 million due to the settlement of a switched access dispute. Excluding the additional revenue due to the Commonwealth and Global Valley acquisitions and the one-time favorable settlement in the first quarter of 2007, revenue for the first quarter of 2008 would have declined by $10.2 million, or 2 percent, as compared to the first quarter of 2007. Our revenue declined as a result of lower access lines, subsidy revenue and switched access revenue, partially offset by a $12.7 million increase in data and internet services revenue.
Other operating expenses and network access expenses for the first quarter of 2008 were $263.8 million, as compared to $240.7 million in the first quarter of 2007. The increase of $23.1 million in 2008 as compared to the first quarter of 2007 is primarily the result of $21.5 million in additional expenses attributable to the acquired operations of Commonwealth and Global Valley. The purchases of Commonwealth and Global Valley have enabled the Company to leverage its centralized back office, customer service and administrative support functions over a larger customer base. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of 2008 was $141.1 million, as compared to $122.2 million in the first quarter of 2007, a 15 percent increase, reflecting the impact of a larger asset base due to the 2007 acquisitions, partially offset by a declining net asset base for our legacy Citizens properties. Operating income for the first quarter of 2008 was $164.3 million and operating income margin was 28.9 percent, as compared to operating income of $193.3 million and operating income margin of 34.8 percent in the first quarter of 2007. The first quarter 2008 decrease of $29.0 million is primarily the result of the favorable one-time impact of $38.7 million in revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2007 from the settlement of a switched access dispute. Investment and other (loss) income, net reflects the premium paid of $6.3 million to repurchase a portion of the Company's 9.25% Senior Notes due 2011. The Company lost approximately 43,100 access lines, of which 15 percent were second lines, during the first quarter of 2008 and had more than 2,387,100 access lines at March 31, 2008. The Company added approximately 20,200 high-speed internet customers during the first quarter of 2008 and had more than 543,000 high-speed internet customers at March 31, 2008. The Company added approximately 7,800 video customers during the first quarter of 2008 and had more than 101,400 video customers at March 31, 2008. Capital expenditures were $48.0 million for the first quarter of 2008. Free cash flow was $172.8 million for the first quarter of 2008. The Company's dividend represents a payout of 48 percent of free cash flow for the first quarter of 2008. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company repurchased 2,317,000 shares of its common stock for $24.8 million. In addition, during the first quarter, the Company repurchased $128.7 million principal amount of its 9.25% Senior Notes due 2011 for $135.0 million, and also retired all of its outstanding interest rate swap agreements. The Company has increased its free cash flow estimate for 2008 to approximately $470.0 million to $495.0 million after calculating the impact, preliminarily, that the "Economic Stimulus Act of 2008" will have on its cash paid for income taxes. -MORE-
The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow and operating cash flow. A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations, and its divisions measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude $38.7 million in access revenue for the favorable impact of the one-time carrier dispute settlement in the first quarter of 2007, and $2.9 million and $0.2 million of severance and early retirement costs in the first quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively, because the Company believes that the magnitude of such revenues in the first quarter of 2007 is unusual, and such costs in the first quarter of 2008 materially exceeds the comparable costs in the first quarter of 2007. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. -MORE-
While the Company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure. Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.

These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the foregoing information should be read in conjunction with these filings. We do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of future events or circumstances. ### TABLES TO FOLLOW
