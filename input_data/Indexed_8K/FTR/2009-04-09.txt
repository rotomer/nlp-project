Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, (ii) or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of the Underwriters.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the third paragraph, the third and fourth sentences of the fifth paragraph, the sixth, seventh, eighth and tenth paragraphs in the section entitled "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.
Indemnification of the Company.
(c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not

provided
 
relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as reasonably incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could reasonably have been expected to become a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
provided
further
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.
pro
rata
 
(f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.

Termination
10. . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require
 
each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11. (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); and (viii) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors.
Payment of Expenses.
(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.

J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
As Representative of the several Underwriters
named in Schedule 1 to the Underwriting
Agreement referred to below
c/o J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
270 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10017
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for Frontier Communications Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase from the Company by the several underwriters named in to the Underwriting Agreement (as defined below) (collectively, the "Underwriters"), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of April 3, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., acting as the representative of the several Underwriters, of $600 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 8.25% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Notes") issued under the Indenture, dated as of April 9, 2009 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 9, 2009 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. This letter is furnished to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6(g) of the Underwriting Agreement. Except as otherwise defined herein, terms used in this letter but not otherwise defined herein are used as defined in the Underwriting Agreement.
Schedule 1
In connection with the opinions and views expressed herein, we have examined such documents, records and matters of law as we have deemed relevant or necessary for purposes of such opinions and views. Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have participated in the preparation of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-158391) (the "Registration Statement"), the Prospectus dated April 3, 2009 (the "Base Prospectus"), the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated April 3, 2009 (together with the Base Prospectus, the "Preliminary Prospectus"), the information identified on Annex C to the Underwriting Agreement (together with the Preliminary Prospectus, the "Time of Sale Information") and the Prospectus Supplement dated April [6], 2009 (together with the Base Prospectus, the "Final Prospectus") (the
 
Exchange Act Documents (as defined below) having previously been prepared and filed by the Company without our participation). Each of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus includes the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act (collectively, the "Exchange Act Documents"). From time to time, we have had discussions with certain officers, directors and employees of the Company, with representatives of KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who examined the financial statements of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus, with the Underwriters and with counsel to the Underwriters concerning the information contained in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus and the proposed responses to various items in Form S-3. Based on our participation and discussions described above, we are of the view that the Registration Statement (including all information deemed to be part of and included therein pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act), as of April 3, 2009, which is the date you have identified as the earlier of the date the Final Prospectus was first used or the date of the first contract of sale of the Notes (such date, the "Effective Date"), and the Final Prospectus, as of its date, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") thereunder, except that we express no view with respect to (i) the financial statements, financial schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or (ii) the information referred to under the caption "Experts" as having been included or incorporated by reference therein on the authority of KPMG LLP as experts.
We have not independently verified and are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness (except as and to the extent set forth in paragraph 8 above) of the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus. Based on the participation and discussions described above, however, no facts have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Registration Statement (including all information deemed to be part of and included therein pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act), as of the Effective Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, as of 5:19 p.m. on April 3, 2009 (which is the time that you have informed us was prior to the first contract of sale of any Notes by the Underwriters), included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Final Prospectus, as of its date or on the date hereof, included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that we express no view with respect to (i) the financial statements, financial schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or (ii) the information referred to under the caption "Experts" as having been included or incorporated by reference therein on the authority of KPMG LLP as experts.
 
The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose are pending or threatened by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The opinions and views set forth above are subject to the following limitations, qualifications and assumptions:
We have assumed, for purposes of the opinions and views expressed herein, the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of original and certified documents and the conformity to original or certified copies of all copies submitted to us as conformed or reproduction copies. For the purposes of the opinions and views expressed herein, we also have assumed that the Trustee has authorized, executed, authenticated and delivered the documents or securities to which it is a party and that each of such documents or securities is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Trustee.
As to facts material to the opinions and assumptions expressed herein, we have, with your consent, relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others, including the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement. We have not independently verified such matters.
The opinions expressed in paragraph 1 above with respect to the existence and good standing of the Company are based solely on a certificate of public officials as to factual matters or legal conclusions set forth therein.
Our opinions set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 above with respect to the enforceability of the documents or securities referred to in such opinions are subject to: (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance, voidable preference, moratorium or other similar laws, and related regulations and judicial doctrines from time to time in effect, relating to or affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, good faith and fair dealing and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought; (iii) the qualification that we express no opinion as to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision in any document or security relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation that may be violative of the public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation); and (iv) the qualification that to the extent any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of the documents or securities referred to therein, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law  5-1401, 5-1402 (McKinney 2001, supp. 2009) and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 327(b) (McKinney 2001, supp. 2009), and that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations.
The statements above with respect to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement under the Securities Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement having been issued and no proceedings for that purpose being
 
pending or threatened by the Commission are based solely on telephone conversations involving lawyers in our firm actively engaged in our representation of the Company in this matter and members of the staff of the Commission, and such statements are made as of the time of such conversations.
The opinions and views expressed herein are limited to (i) the federal securities laws of the United States of America, (ii) the laws of the State of New York and (iii) the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, in each case as currently in effect and we express no opinion or view as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction on the opinions and views expressed herein. In addition, we express no opinions as to the statutes administered by, the rules and regulations of, or matters exclusively within the purview of, the Federal Communications Commission, any comparable state governmental authority or agency, or any state public utility commission or comparable state authority or agency. Our opinions and views are limited to those expressly set forth herein, and we express no opinion or view by implication.
This letter is furnished by us to you solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and solely with respect to the purchase of the Notes from the Company by the Underwriters, upon the understanding that we are not hereby assuming any professional responsibility to any other person whatsoever, and that this letter is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Frontier Communications Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). In connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated April 3, 2009 (the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and J.P.

For purposes of the opinion set forth in paragraphs four through seven above, although I do not have responsibility for the oversight of regulatory matters at the Company, I have, in the case of paragraphs four and five, reviewed the disclosure in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Business  Regulatory Environment" and "Risk Factors  Risks Related to Regulation" and, in the case of all such paragraphs, have consulted with the persons responsible at the Company for regulatory matters as well as outside regulatory counsel.
In addition, my opinion expressed in paragraph seven above is based solely upon my understanding, or the understanding of lawyers working under my supervision, of the plain language of such Material Agreements, and I do not express any opinion as to the validity, binding nature or enforceability of any such Material Agreement, and I do not assume any responsibility with respect to the effect on my opinion of any interpretation thereof inconsistent with such understanding. My opinion also does not extend to compliance by the Company or the Significant Subsidiary with any financial ratio or limitation in any Material Agreement expressed as a dollar amount (or an amount expressed in another currency).
 
The opinions expressed herein are furnished by me as General Counsel of the Company and are solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and solely with respect to the purchase of the Notes from the Company by the Underwriters, and, other than as stated hereunder, may not be relied upon in any manner for any other purpose, or by any other persons, without my prior written consent.
I hereby consent to reliance on the opinions expressed herein by Jones Day, counsel to the Company, and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel to the Underwriters, solely for the purpose of their respective opinions also to be rendered under the Underwriting Agreement, and not in any other manner for any other purpose, or by any other persons, without my prior written consent.

provided
 
. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Notes of any series executed by the Company together with a Company Order for authentication and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Notes upon receipt of such Company Order. In authenticating such Notes, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Notes, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
Section 2.03.
Authentication
(1) a copy of any resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors relating thereto and, if applicable, an appropriate record of any action taken pursuant to such resolution, in each case certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company;
(2) an executed supplemental indenture relating thereto;
(3) an Officers' Certificate prepared in accordance with Section 11.04 which shall also state to the best knowledge of the signers of such Officers' Certificate that no Event of Default with respect to any series of Notes shall have occurred and be continuing; and
(4) an Opinion of Counsel prepared in accordance with Section 11.04 which, in addition to satisfying the provisions of Section 11.04, shall also substantially state:
(A) the form or forms and terms of such Notes have been established by and in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; that if all such Notes are not to be issued at the same time, such Opinion of Counsel may state that such terms will be established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture, subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel; and
provided
(B) such Notes, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and to general principles of equity.
The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver or cause to be authenticated and delivered any Notes of any series under this Section 2.03 if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or trustees, executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or vice presidents shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Noteholders.
 
. The Notes of each series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.02. In the absence of any such specification with respect to the Notes of any series, the Notes of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any multiple of $1,000. Notes of each series shall be numbered, lettered or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in accordance with such plan as the Officers of the Company executing the same may determine with the approval of the Trustee.
Section 2.04.
Date and Denomination of Notes
Every Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.
The person in whose name any Note of a particular series is registered at the close of business on any record date (as hereinafter defined) with respect to any interest payment date for such series shall be entitled to receive the interest payable on such interest payment date notwithstanding the cancellation of such Note upon any registration of transfer or exchange subsequent to the record date and prior to such interest payment date; , , that if and to the extent that the Company shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest payment date, such defaulted interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names Outstanding Notes of such series are registered on a subsequent record date established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Company to the Holders of such Notes not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date, such record date to be not less than five days preceding the date of payment of such defaulted interest. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for Notes of a particular series, the term "record date" as used in this Section 2.04 with respect to any regular interest payment date, shall mean, the last day of the calendar month preceding such interest payment date if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of such calendar month, and shall mean the fifteenth day of the calendar month preceding such interest payment date if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, whether or not such day shall be a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to close or remain closed.
provided
however
Interest on the Notes may at the option of the Company be paid by check mailed to the persons entitled thereto at their respective addresses as such appear on the registry books of the Company.
. The Notes shall be signed in the name and on behalf of the Company by the manual or facsimile signature of its Chairman of the Board of Directors, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, or its Chief Financial Officer and its Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer, its Secretary or Assistant Secretary. Only such Notes as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form herein recited, executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of an authorized officer, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Note executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the Note so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 2.05.
Execution of Notes
In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Notes shall cease to be such officer before the Notes so signed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, or disposed of by the Company, such Notes nevertheless may be authenticated and
 
delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Notes had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Note may be signed on behalf of the Company by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Note, shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at the date of the execution of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.
. Notes of any series may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of the same series of other authorized denominations. Notes to be exchanged shall be surrendered, at the option of the Holders thereof, either at the office or agency designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose for such series in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02 or at any of such other offices or agencies as may be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose for such series in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02, and the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Note or Notes which the Noteholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive. Each person designated by the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.02 as a person authorized to register and register transfer of the Notes is sometimes herein referred to as a "Registrar." The Trustee is hereby initially appointed as Registrar for each series of Notes.
Section 2.06.
Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Notes
The Company shall keep, at one of its offices or agencies maintained pursuant to Section 4.02, a register for each series of Notes issued hereunder (the registers of all Registrars being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall register Notes and shall register the transfer of Notes as in this Article 2 provided. The Security Register shall be in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times the Security Register shall be open for inspection by the Trustee and any Registrar other than the Trustee. Upon due presentment for registration or registration of transfer of any Note of any series at any designated office or agency, the Company shall execute and register and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Note or Notes of the same series for an equal aggregate principal amount. Registration or registration of transfer of any Note by any Registrar in the registry books of the Company maintained by such Registrar, and delivery of such Note, duly authenticated, shall be deemed to complete the registration or registration of transfer of such Note.
No person shall at any time be designated as or act as a Registrar unless such person is at such time empowered under applicable law to act as such under and to the extent required by applicable law and regulations.
All Notes presented for registration of transfer or for exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer or exchange in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
 
The Company shall not be required to issue, exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Notes of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the selection of Notes of that series to be redeemed and thereafter until the date of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Notes of that series selected for redemption, , , that the Trustee shall have no duty or responsibility with respect to issuing, exchanging or registering a transfer during such period unless and until it shall have received written notice setting forth the date which starts such 15 day period; or (b) any Notes selected, called or being called for redemption in whole or in part except, in the case of any Note to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
provided
however
The provisions of clauses (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) below shall apply only to Global Notes:
(1) Each Global Note of any series authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Note or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Note shall constitute a single Note for all purposes under this Indenture.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Note of any series may be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes of such series issued in definitive form, and no transfer of a Global Note of any series in whole or in part may be registered in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Note or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue its services as Depositary for such Global Note and no successor Depositary has been appointed within 90 days after such notice or (ii) ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as the Depositary and so notifies the Company, and no successor Depositary has been appointed within 90 days after such notice, (B) the Company determines at any time that the Notes of such series shall no longer be represented by Global Notes and shall inform such Depositary for such Global Note of such determination and participants in such Depositary elect to withdraw their beneficial interests in the Notes from such Depositary, following notification by the Depositary of their right to do so, or (C) such exchange is made upon request by or on behalf of the Depositary for such Global Note in accordance with customary procedures, following the request of a beneficial owner seeking to exercise or enforce its rights under the Notes.
(3) Subject to clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Note of any series for other Notes of such series may be made in whole or in part, and all such Notes issued in exchange for a Global Note or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Note shall direct.
(4) Every Note of a series authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Note of such series or any portion thereof shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Note, unless such Note is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Note or a nominee thereof.
(5) Subject to the provisions of clause (7) below, the registered Holder of Notes of any series may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members (as defined below in clause (7)) and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which such Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or such Notes.
 
(6) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (2) above, the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of certificated Notes of such series in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons.
(7) Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary of any series (collectively, the "Agent Members") nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Note of such series registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global Note, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Note for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company or the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by such Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between such Depositary, its Agent Members and any other person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any Note.
. In case any temporary or definitive Note shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in the case of a mutilated Note shall, and in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Note may in its discretion, execute and, upon the written request or authorization of any Officer of the Company, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Note of the same series, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Note, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Note so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Note shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and the ownership thereof.
Section 2.07.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes
Upon the issuance of any substituted Note, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Note which has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substituted Note, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Note) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and the ownership thereof.
Every replacement Note of any series issued in accordance with this Section 2.07 shall be the valid obligation of the Company, evidencing the same indebtedness as the destroyed, lost or stolen Note, and shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with all other Notes of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Notes shall be
 
held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
. Pending the preparation of definitive Notes of any series the Company may execute and, upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Notes of such series (printed, lithographed or typewritten). Temporary Notes of any series shall be issuable in any authorized denomination and substantially in the form of the definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Notes, all as may be determined by the Company, as evidenced by its execution of such Notes. Every such temporary Note shall be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued. Without unreasonable delay the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee definitive Notes of such series and thereupon any or all temporary Notes of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at the option of the holders thereof, either at the office or agency to be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose for that series in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02 or at any of such other offices or agencies as may be designated and maintained by the Company for such purpose for that series in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.02, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Notes of such series an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes of the same series. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Notes of the same series authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Section 2.08.
Temporary Notes
. All Notes surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, repayment, exchange or registration of transfer or for credit against any sinking fund shall, if surrendered to the Company, any Registrar, any Paying Agent or any other agent of the Company or of the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and promptly cancelled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly cancelled by it, and no Notes shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee may dispose of cancelled Notes in accordance with its customary procedures and, at the written request of the Company, deliver a certificate of such disposition to the Company or, at the written request of the Company, shall deliver cancelled Notes to the Company. If the Company shall acquire any of the Notes, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. Where the Notes are held in global form, and to the extent less than all of the Notes are to be cancelled, the Registrar's notation of such cancellation on its books and records shall be deemed to satisfy any cancellation obligation.
Section 2.09.
Cancellation of Notes Paid, etc
 
. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for Notes of any series, interest on the Notes of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Section 2.10.
Computation of Interest
. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.02 for the Notes evidenced thereby, every Global Note authenticated and delivered hereunder shall bear a legend in substantially the following form (or such other form as a securities exchange or Depositary may request or require):
Section 2.11.
Form of Legend for Global Notes
THIS NOTE IS A GLOBAL NOTE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY ("DTC"), OR A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY. THIS NOTE IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR NOTES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY TO THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY.

OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
PURSUANT TO A RECOMMENDATION PROMULGATED BY THE COMMITTEE ON UNIFORM SECURITY IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES, THE COMPANY HAS CAUSED CUSIP NUMBERS TO BE PRINTED ON THE NOTES AND THE TRUSTEE MAY USE CUSIP NUMBERS IN NOTICES OF REDEMPTION OR REPURCHASE AS A CONVENIENCE TO HOLDERS. NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO THE ACCURACY OF SUCH NUMBERS EITHER AS PRINTED ON THE NOTES OR AS CONTAINED IN ANY NOTICE OF REDEMPTION AND RELIANCE MAY BE PLACED ONLY ON THE OTHER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS PLACED THEREON.
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on, such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Section 3.02.
.
Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions
Notice of redemption to the Holders of Notes of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Company shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Notes of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Security Register, with a copy thereof provided by the Company to the Trustee. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Notes of such series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Note. The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall specify (i) the principal amount of each Note held by such Holder to be redeemed, (ii) the date fixed for redemption, (iii) the redemption price, (iv) the place or places of payment, (v) the CUSIP number relating to the Notes, (vi) that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of the Notes, (vii) whether interest, if any, accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and (viii) whether on and after said date interest, if any, thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. In case any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
The notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed at the option of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
On or before the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section 3.02, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 4.05(b)) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Notes of such series so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price,
 
together with accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption. The Company will deliver to the Trustee at least 45 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (but no later than the receipt by the Holders of the notice of redemption) (unless a shorter notice period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series to be redeemed. In case of a redemption at the election of the Company prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee, prior to the giving of any notice of redemption to Holders pursuant to this Section 3.02, an Officers' Certificate stating that such restriction has been complied with.
If less than all of the Notes of such series are to be redeemed, selection of the Notes for redemption shall be made by the Trustee as follows:
(a) if such Notes are listed on any principal national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of such principal national securities exchange; or
(b) if such Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis (subject to the procedures of DTC) or, to the extent a pro rata basis is not permitted, in such manner as the Trustee shall deem to be fair and appropriate.
However, no Note of $1,000 in principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion shall be issued upon cancellation of the original Note. Notice of the redemption shall be given only after such selection has been made. Notes may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Notes or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Notes selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Notes shall relate, in the case of any Note redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Note which has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 3.03.
Payment of Notes Called for Redemption
.
If notice of redemption has been given as provided by this Article 3, the Notes or portions of Notes specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest, if any, accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Notes at the redemption price, together with interest, if any, accrued to said date) interest, if any, on the Notes or portions of Notes so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and such Notes shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption, except as provided herein, to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Notes except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Notes at a place of payment specified in said notice, said Notes or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with interest, if any, accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; that payment of interest, if any, becoming due on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of Notes registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of this Section 3.03.
provided
 
If any Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the redemption price shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest borne by such Note.
Upon presentation of any Note redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Note or Notes, and of like tenor, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Note so presented.
Section 3.04.
Exclusion of Certain Securities from Eligibility for Selection for Redemption
.
Notes shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 45 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Company, or (b) a Person specifically identified in such written statement as an Affiliate of the Company.

The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in location, of such office or agency. In case the Company shall at any time fail to maintain any such office or agency, or shall fail to give notice to the Trustee of any change in the location thereof, presentation may be made and notice and demand may be served in respect of such Notes or of this Indenture at the Corporate Trust Office. The Company hereby initially designates the Corporate Trust Office for each such purpose.
 
Section 4.03.

The Company shall indemnify the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee against and hold each harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, penalties, fines, liabilities or expenses, including incidental and out-of-pocket expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees (for purposes of this Article 7, "losses") incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company (including this Section 7.07) and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company or any Holder or any other Person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to the extent such losses may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith.

Such Lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
 
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(d) or 6.01(e) with respect to any series of Notes, the expenses and the compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.

If a successor Trustee with respect to any series of Notes does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company, or the bona fide Holders of at least 10% in aggregate principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes of such series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of such series as their names and addresses appear in the Security Registrar.

Subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.07 hereof, the retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee; , , that all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder shall have been paid. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all rights, powers and trusts.

For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Notes of such series, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant, or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document, and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes shall be unaffected thereby.
