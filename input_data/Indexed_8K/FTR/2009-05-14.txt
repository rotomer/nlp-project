Depending on the trading prices of the Companys common stock prior to the closing, Verizon stockholders will own between approximately 66% and 71% of the Surviving Corporation, and the Company stockholders will own approximately 29% to 34% of the Surviving Corporation.
The parties to the Merger Agreement have made to each other certain representations and warranties.  The representations and warranties and pre-closing covenants made by the parties in the Merger Agreement do not survive the closing of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not contain any post-closing indemnification obligations with respect to these representations and warranties or pre-closing covenants.
 
 
 
The parties have agreed to certain covenants and agreements, including with respect to confidentiality, cooperation, regulatory approvals and other regulatory matters, the Spinco financing, the conduct of Spincos and the Companys businesses (including the operation thereof) prior to the completion of the Merger, public announcements and similar matters.  The parties have also agreed that the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of twelve directors, nine of whom shall be designated by the Company and three of whom shall be designated by Verizon.

Verizon has agreed to indemnify the Company for (i) failure to satisfy its liabilities (other than those relating to the Business and assumed by Spinco) or to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement or the Distribution Agreement, (ii) the actual amount of existing Verizon debt assumed by Spinco at closing exceeding the estimated amount of such indebtedness used to calculate the amount of cash proceeds to be paid to Verizon by Spinco prior to the closing and (iii) misstatements or omissions (based on information provided by Verizon) in registration statements or related proxy statement/prospectus to be prepared in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Distribution Agreement (the ). The Company has agreed to indemnify Verizon for (i) failure to satisfy the liabilities assumed by Spinco relating to the Business or to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement or Distribution Agreement and (ii) misstatements or omissions (except for those based on information provided by Verizon) in the SEC Filings.
SEC Filings
Under the Merger Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from soliciting competing acquisition proposals and may not discuss or negotiate a competing acquisition proposal unless the board of directors of the Company (the ) determines in good faith that the proposal, among other things, would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and that the failure of the Board to consider such proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the Boards fiduciary duties.  If the Board makes such determination, the Company may engage in discussions and negotiations with the prospective acquirer, provided that, prior to providing any non-public information or entering into discussions or negotiations over such proposal, the Company notifies Verizon of the competing acquisition proposal.  The Company must also keep Verizon reasonably informed as to the status and material terms of such proposal, on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours following receipt of a proposal or changes thereto) and provide to Verizon any information given to the prospective acquirer that was not previously provided to Verizon.  The Board may change its recommendation of the Merger prior to receiving stockholder approval if the Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with legal advisors, that failing to change its recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties.  However, the Company is required to submit the Merger Agreement to a stockholder vote even if the Board changes its recommendation of the Merger (including in connection with a superior proposal), and the Company may not terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal.  In addition, prior to any recommendation change, the Company must provide Verizon five business days advance notice and the opportunity for Verizon to submit a revised proposal to the Board within such five business day period.
Board
The Merger Agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances, including, among others: (i) by any of the parties if the Merger has not been completed by July 31, 2010 (such date may be extended in certain circumstances by either Verizon or the Company for one month periods that shall not exceed 120 days in order to obtain outstanding regulatory consents or one month and two month periods not to exceed 150 days in order to complete certain financing transactions) (the ), (ii) by any of the parties if the stockholders of the Company do not approve the Merger, (iii) by Verizon if the Board withdraws or modifies its recommendation of the Merger or recommends a competing acquisition proposal or if the Company fails to hold the stockholders meeting within 60 days after the clears the proxy statement/prospectus for mailing to the Companys stockholders, (iv) by Verizon or the Company in the event of certain material breaches of the Merger Agreement by the other party not curable by the End Date and (v) by Verizon if the average of the volume of weighted averages of the trading prices of the Companys common stock for any period of 60 consecutive trading days prior to closing is below $3.87.
End Date

In the event that (a) Verizon and Spinco terminate the Merger Agreement as a result of the Board withdrawing or modifying its recommendation of the Merger or recommending a competing acquisition proposal or the Company failing to hold the stockholders meeting within 60 days after the SEC clears the proxy statement/prospectus for mailing to the Companys stockholders, or (b)(1) the Company receives a competing acquisition proposal and one of the parties terminates the Merger Agreement due to the passing of the End Date or Verizon terminates the Merger Agreement because the Company breaches certain specified provisions of the Merger Agreement, or a competing acquisition proposal has been publicly announced prior to the stockholders meeting and the Companys stockholders fail to approve the Merger and (2) within 12 months after such termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company consummates a business combination transaction or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to such a transaction, then the Company shall pay to Verizon a termination fee of $80 million.

Distribution Agreement
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Distribution Agreement, Verizon will transfer or cause to be transferred certain assets related to the Business to Spinco. Spinco will enter into agreements associated with certain financing transactions to be consummated by Spinco and distribute to Verizon the cash proceeds thereof in an amount not to exceed (i) the lesser of (a) $3.333 billion and (b) Verizons estimate of its tax basis in Spinco, less (ii) the amount of existing Verizon debt assumed by Spinco (the ).  To the extent that the amount of the Special Payment, plus the amount of existing Verizon debt assumed by Spinco, is less than $3.333 billion, Spinco will Verizon will then distribute all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Spinco to holders of the outstanding shares of common stock of Verizon on the date of the Distribution.

Distribution Date Working Capital
Employee Matters Agreement
The Employee Matters Agreement governs the rights and obligations of Verizon and the Company with respect to current and former employees of the Verizon companies whose duties relate primarily to the Business.  Under the Employee Matters Agreement, (i) Verizon will generally retain all liabilities with respect to former employees of the Business who do not remain employees of the Business as a result of the Merger and (ii) the Company will generally assume all liabilities with respect to employees of the Business who will remain employees of the Business immediately following the Merger and its subsidiaries upon consummation of the Merger (), with the exception of liabilities relating to certain claims arising in respect of Spinco Employees prior to the Merger under Verizons employee benefit plans and programs.  With respect to the Spinco Employees, the Employee Matters Agreement addresses matters including the assumption of any collective bargaining agreements governing the employment of the Spinco Employees, the establishment of employee benefit plans and arrangements for the Spinco Employees, the transfer of pension plan assets from Verizons pension plans to pension plans established for the benefit of the Spinco Employees, and the treatment of equity and incentive plan awards held by the Spinco Employees.  The Employee Matters Agreement also addresses Verizons and the Companys rights to indemnification in respect of liabilities that may arise with respect to current or former employees of the Business.
Spinco Employees
 
 
 
Tax Sharing Agreement
The Tax Sharing Agreement will govern the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations of Verizon and the Company after the Distribution and Merger with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax matters regarding income taxes, other taxes and related tax returns.
In general, Verizon will be responsible for all taxes for periods before the Distribution that are reportable on any tax return that includes Verizon or one of its non-Spinco subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Spinco or one of its subsidiaries, on the other hand.  Spinco will be responsible for all taxes reportable on any tax return that includes Spinco and/or its subsidiaries but does not include any non-Spinco subsidiaries. 
Different rules apply to tax liability arising on account of the Distribution and certain related transactions.  While those transactions are intended to be tax-free, significant tax liability could arise if they are not. The Tax Sharing Agreement allocates this tax liability between Verizon and the Company.  In general, the Company is liable if the Distribution is taxable as a result of (i) its actions or changes in ownership not caused by Verizon, (ii) its failure to take any reasonably required action to prevent the Distribution from being taxable, if the Company is aware of, or has been notified by Verizon, of the need for such action or (iii) its breach of a representation or covenant.  If the Distribution is taxable as a result of certain actions by both parties, the liability is shared equally.  Verizon is liable in all other cases.
To preserve the tax-free status of the Distribution, the Tax Sharing Agreement provides for certain restrictions on the Company's ability to pursue strategic or other transactions. In some cases, these transactions will be permitted if (a) the Company delivers to Verizon a legal opinion, satisfactory to Verizon, stating that the intended transaction will not prevent the Distribution and related transactions from being tax-free or (b) the parties obtain a letter ruling, satisfactory to Verizon, from the IRS to this effect. However, these exceptions will not relieve the Company of its obligation to indemnify Verizon if its actions cause the Distribution and related transactions to be taxable.

These statements speak only as of the date of this report and are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance.  Words such as believe, anticipate, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements (including oral representations) involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements.  These risks and uncertainties are based on a number of factors, including but not limited to:  reductions in the number of our access lines and high-speed internet subscribers; the effects of competition from cable, wireless and other wireline carriers (through voice over internet protocol (VOIP) or otherwise); reductions in switched access revenues as a result of regulation, competition and/or technology substitutions; the effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; the effects of changes in both general and local economic conditions on the markets we serve, which can impact demand for our products and services, customer purchasing decisions, collectibility of revenue and required levels of capital expenditures related to new construction of residences and businesses; our ability to effectively manage service quality; our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to our customers; our ability to sell enhanced and data services in order to offset ongoing declines in revenue from local services, switched access services and subsidies; changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulators; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation, including potential changes in state rate of return limitations on our earnings, access charges and subsidy payments, and regulatory network upgrade and reliability requirements; our ability to effectively manage our operations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, to pay dividends and to reduce or refinance our debt; adverse changes in the credit markets and/or in the ratings given to our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict the availability and/or increase the cost of financing; the effects of bankruptcies and home foreclosures, which could result in
delays in consummating the transaction; the failure to obtain our stockholders approval; the receipt of an IRS ruing approving the tax-free status of the transaction;
increased bad debts; the effects of technological changes and competition on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; the effects of increased medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; changes in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, and/or federal or state tax assessments; further declines in the value of our pension plan assets, which could require us to make contributions to the pension plan beginning in 2010, at the earliest; the effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; our ability to successfully renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2009 and thereafter; our ability to pay a $1.00 per common share dividend annually prior to closing, which may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes (which will increase in 2009) and our liquidity; the effects of significantly increased cash taxes in 2009 and thereafter; the effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any of our current or future legal, governmental, or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; the possible impact of adverse changes in political or other external factors over which we have no control; and the effects of hurricanes, ice storms or other severe weather.  These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

Closing Statement
 
(b)           Verizon shall give the Surviving Corporation and each of its Representatives access at all reasonable times and on reasonable advance notice to Verizons books and records to the extent reasonably required to permit the Surviving Corporation to review the Closing Statement.

If the Surviving Corporation and Verizon do not jointly select such firm within five days, a nationally recognized accounting firm shall be selected by lot from among those nationally recognized firms which are not the regular firm of either Verizon or the Surviving Corporation.  Such accounting firm shall arbitrate and resolve such dispute based solely on the written submission forwarded by Verizon and the Surviving Corporation and shall only consider whether the Closing Statement was prepared in accordance with this Article V and (only with respect to disputed matters submitted to the accounting firm) whether and to what extent the Closing Statement requires adjustment.

(d)           If the amount of the Distribution Date Working Capital, as set forth in the Final Closing Statement (the ) exceeds the Target Working Capital, no payment shall be made by either party with respect thereto and, if the amount of the Final Distribution Date Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, Verizon shall pay to the Surviving Corporation an amount equal to such deficit.  All such amounts shall bear interest from the Distribution Date through but excluding the date of payment at the Applicable Rate; such interest shall accrue daily on the basis of a 365 day year calculated for the actual number of days for which payment is due and such payment shall be payable together with the amount payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence.

(b)           .  As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, Verizons actuary shall calculate and certify the Pension Plan Asset Transfer Amount that is to be transferred to each Spinco Pension Plan (other than the Spinco Excess Pension Plan) as of the Distribution Date.  With respect to each such asset transfer from each Verizon Pension Plan, the Pension Plan Asset Transfer Amount shall be equal to the amount determined in accordance with the requirements of Section 414(l) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, based on the present value of benefits in respect of Spinco Employees and persons entitled to receive a benefit in respect of such Spinco Employees, calculated on a plan termination basis, and, where applicable, giving effect to the allocation of assets under Section 4044 of ERISA, but without regard to the de minimis rule available under the regulations promulgated under Section 414(l).  For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Verizon Pension Plan transfer to any Spinco Pension Plan assets in excess of the amount required to be transferred based on the present value of the accrued benefits of participants, as determined in accordance with Section 414(l).  In the event that the aggregate of the Pension Plan Asset Transfer Amounts for all of the Verizon Pension Plans that are qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the ) has a value which is less than the aggregate Projected Benefit Obligations () for all the Spinco participants under all such qualified Verizon Pension Plans (the ), Verizon will be responsible for the differential between the Aggregate PBO and the Aggregate Assets (the ) as described in the next sentence.  Verizon will pay the Differential to either Frontier or an underfunded Spinco Pension Plan (or Plans) identified by Frontier; provided, however, that if the Differential is paid directly to Frontier, Frontier shall contribute the entire amount to one or more of the underfunded Spinco Pension Plans as soon as practicable.  The assumptions to be used with respect to the determination of the amount of assets to be transferred from any Verizon Pension Plan and in determining the PBO in respect of any Pension Plan and the Aggregate PBO are set forth in Exhibit A hereto entitled Actuarial Assumptions and Methods for Pension Asset Transfer.

Within ten (10) days after the date Verizon certifies to Frontier the Pension Plan Asset Transfer Amount to be transferred to each Spinco Pension Plan, Verizons actuary shall provide Frontiers actuary with a complete computer file containing the employee data and all other relevant information used by Verizons actuary or otherwise reasonably requested by Frontiers actuary as needed to calculate the Pension Plan Asset Transfer Amount (including data and information related to such calculation and otherwise appropriate for Frontiers actuary to consider, and any other data and information reasonably requested by Frontiers actuary).  The Pension Plan Asset Transfer Amount shall become final and binding upon the Parties at the close of business on the 30 day following Frontiers receipt of such computer file and any such additional data used by Verizons actuary to make its determination and any additional information reasonably requested by Frontiers actuary, unless prior to such 30 day Frontier delivers a written notice to Verizon stating that Frontier believes that the calculation of the Pension Plan Asset Transfer Amount contains factual or mathematical errors or otherwise fails to comport with the actuarial assumptions expressly set forth in Exhibit A and states in reasonable detail the basis for such belief.  Should Frontier timely provide such notice, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve promptly any disagreements regarding such calculations.  In the event that the Parties cannot resolve such disagreements, the Parties shall jointly select an independent third actuary with whom none of the Parties have a material relationship, who shall render its determination promptly in accordance with the requirements of this Section 5.2(b) and whose determination shall be binding on the Parties.  The third actuary shall be required to confirm the determination of the Verizon actuary unless, and solely to the extent that, the third actuary determines that such determination (i) contains factual or mathematical errors or (ii) applying an abuse of discretion standard such that the determination of the Verizon actuary shall be confirmed unless it has no reasonable basis, otherwise fails to comport with the actuarial assumptions set forth in Exhibit A.  In no event (except for inaccuracy of the data provided) shall the amount determined by the third actuary be more than the amount claimed by Frontier or less than the amount shown in the calculations of Verizons actuary.  Each of the Parties shall bear the fees, costs and expenses of their respective actuaries, and the fees, costs and expense of the third actuary shall be borne one half by Verizon and one half by Frontier.  Any decision by the third actuary shall be treated as Confidential Information by the parties, except as may be required to obtain judgment on the award or enforce performance thereof or except as disclosure may be required by law.

The amount determined under the preceding sentence shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the investment return on the applicable amount determined in accordance with the letter of direction agreed to by the Parties and attached hereto as Schedule 5.2(c)(ii) (the ).  If the sum of the Initial Asset Transfer plus the Benefit Payments exceeds the Pension Plan Asset Transfer Amount for a Spinco Pension Plan, then the portion of the Spinco Trust relating to such plan shall return such excess, increased or decreased by the investment return determined in accordance with the Letter of Direction from the date of the Initial Asset Transfer (or the date of the Benefit Payment, as the case may be) to the date of return, to the portion of the Verizon Trust relating to the corresponding Verizon Pension Plan.

The Indemnifying Party shall make payment in full of such amount so determined to be due and owing by it and, if, and to the extent that, there exists a claim against any third party (other than an insurer) in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnitee shall assign such claim against such third party to the Indemnifying Party.  Any tax benefit actually received by an Indemnified Party shall be paid over to the Indemnifying Party to the extent such tax benefit relates to an Indemnifiable Loss for which indemnification has already been received.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties hereto that no insurer or any other third party shall be () entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions or () relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.  If an Indemnitee shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Indemnifiable Losses and shall subsequently actually receive insurance proceeds, tax benefits or other amounts in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses, then such Indemnitee shall hold such insurance proceeds in trust for the benefit of such Indemnifying Party and shall promptly pay to such Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds, tax benefits or other amounts actually received, up to the aggregate amount of any payments received from such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses.

(b)           The relative fault of Verizon and Frontier shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent the applicable act, failure to act, statement or omission that is the basis for the Liability (the ), and whether the Liability event occurred because of one Partys reasonable reliance on the other.

The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an Indemnitee shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
