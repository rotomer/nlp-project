Exhibit 99.1 Frontier Communications 3 High Ridge Park Stamford, CT 06905 203.614.5600 www.frontier.com Frontier Communications Shareholders Approve Acquisition of Verizon Wireline Operations in 14 States STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 27, 2009 -- Frontier Communications Corporation (NYSE: FTR) today announced that its shareholders have overwhelmingly voted to adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Frontier has agreed to acquire Verizon Communications Inc.'s local exchange businesses in 14 states and certain related customer relationships for long distance services, broadband Internet access and broadband video. The shareholders also voted to approve an amendment to Frontier's restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Frontier common stock, and to approve the issuance of Frontier common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. "This is a resounding vote of support from our shareholders," said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman and CEO of Frontier. "This acquisition will be transformational for Frontier, giving us greater scale, a balance sheet approaching investment grade, and a fantastic platform for growth. Shareholder approval marks an important milestone in the transaction process, and we're on track for closing during the second quarter of 2010. Our entire team is hard at work with their counterparts at Verizon to ensure a successful integration. All of us at Frontier are looking forward to providing great products and services to our new customers and to welcoming our new employees."

Forward-Looking Language This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance. Words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements (including oral representations) involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. These risks and uncertainties are based on a number of factors, including but not limited to: Our ability to complete the acquisition of access lines from Verizon; the failure to obtain, delays in obtaining or adverse conditions contained in any required regulatory approvals for the Verizon transaction; the failure to receive the IRS ruling approving the tax-free status of the Verizon transaction; the ability to successfully integrate the Verizon operations into Frontier's existing operations; the effects of increased expenses due to activities related to the Verizon transaction; the ability to migrate Verizon's West Virginia operations from Verizon owned and operated systems and processes to Frontier owned and operated systems and processes successfully; the risk that the growth opportunities and cost synergies from the Verizon transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the sufficiency of the assets to be acquired from Verizon to enable us to operate the acquired business; disruption from the Verizon transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; the effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product or service offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; reductions in the number of our access lines and High-Speed Internet subscribers; our ability to sell enhanced and data services in order to offset ongoing declines in revenue from local services, switched access services and subsidies; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation; the effects of competition from cable, wireless and other wireline carriers (through voice over internet protocol (VOIP) or otherwise); our ability to adjust successfully to changes in the communications industry and to implement strategies for improving growth; adverse changes in the credit markets or in the ratings given to our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict the availability, or increase the cost, of financing; reductions in switched access revenues as a result of regulation, competition and/or technology substitutions; the effects of changes in both general and local economic conditions on the markets we serve, which can impact demand for our products and services, customer purchasing decisions, collectability of revenue and required levels of capital expenditures related to new construction of residences and businesses; our ability to effectively manage service quality; our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to our customers; changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulators; our ability to effectively manage our operations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, to pay dividends and to repay, reduce or refinance our debt; the effects of bankruptcies and home foreclosures, which could result in increased bad debts; the effects of technological changes and competition on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; the effects of increased medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; changes in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, and/or federal or state tax assessments; the effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; our ability to successfully renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2009 and thereafter; declines in the value of our pension plan assets, which could require us to make contributions to the pension plan beginning no earlier than 2010; our ability to pay dividends in respect of our common shares, which may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes and our liquidity; the effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any of our current or future legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; the possible impact of adverse changes in political or other external factors over which we have no control; and the effects of hurricanes, ice storms or other severe weather. These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and the foregoing information should be read in conjunction with these filings. We do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of future events or circumstances.
