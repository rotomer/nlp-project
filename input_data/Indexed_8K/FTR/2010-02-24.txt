 Frontier Communications (NYSE:FTR) today reported fourth-quarter 2009 revenue of $521.0 million, operating income of $157.5 million and net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier of $4.4 million, or $0.01 per share, and $47.0 million, or $0.15 per share, after excluding the two special items noted below.  Fourth quarter 2009 results include a previously announced loss of $53.7 million on the early retirement of Company debt and $13.9 million for acquisition and integration costs.  After adjustment for these two special items, net of tax, net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier for the fourth quarter of 2009 would have been $47.0 million, or $0.15 per share.
Stamford, Conn., February 24, 2010
Frontier delivered operating cash flow margins for the 4th quarter and full year of 2009 in excess of 54%, demonstrating our intense focus on controlling costs while serving customers, said Maggie Wilderotter, Frontier Communications Chairman and CEO.  As we move toward the expected second quarter closing of our Verizon transaction, we remain committed to technology and service leadership for our customers, and a solid return for our stakeholders.
 
for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $521.0 million compared to $547.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, a 4.8 percent decrease.  Revenue declined as a result of access line losses, reduced switched access revenue and lower long distance revenue, partially offset by a 4 percent increase in data and internet services revenue.    The monthly customer revenue per access line has increased approximately $1.08, or 2%, over the prior years fourth quarter while the monthly total revenue per access line has increased $1.16, or 1%, over the same period, as the Company has continued to successfully sell additional products and services, partially offset by reductions in regulatory revenue.  Our exposure to regulatory revenue continues to decline.
Revenue
for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $246.7 million as compared to $256.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, a 4 percent decrease.  Expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 include non-cash pension costs of $9.4 million, as compared to $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Other operating expenses and network access expenses
 
 
Excluding these costs, other operating expenses and network access expenses declined $18.7 million, or 7%, in 2009 as a result of lower wage and benefit expenses, consulting fees and other outside services.
of approximately $13.9 million ($0.03 per share after tax) and $28.3 million ($0.06 per share after tax) were incurred and expensed during the fourth quarter and the full year of 2009, respectively, in connection with our previously announced pending acquisition of approximately 4.2 million access lines (as of December 31, 2009) from Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon).  The fourth quarter costs were incurred in connection with our activities to integrate the West Virginia operations, establish the related systems capabilities for the video services (FiOS) in three states and for professional services utilized in the regulatory approval process.  Our year to date costs were for the same initiatives and activities as well as investment banker and legal fees.
Acquisition and integration costs
for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $157.5 million and operating income margin was 30.2 percent compared to operating income of $151.9 million and operating income margin of 27.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The fourth quarter 2009 increase of $5.6 million is primarily the result of $31.6 million of amortization in 2008 of intangible assets associated with an acquisition in 2001, which were fully amortized in June 2009, and lower operating expenses in 2009, partially offset by the reduction in revenue and the acquisition and integration costs incurred in 2009.
Operating income
for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflects a net loss of $53.7 million ($0.11 per share after tax) recognized on the early retirement of Company debt.  As of December 31, 2009, we retired approximately $1,048.4 million principal amount of debt for $1,094.3 million, and recorded a net loss of $45.9 million ($0.09 per share after tax) for the full year of 2009.
Investment and other income, net
for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $94.2 million as compared to $90.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, a $3.5 million or 4 percent increase ($0.01 per share after tax).  Interest expense increased due to the registered offerings of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014, completed in April 2009, and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior unsecured notes due 2018, completed in October 2009.  We received net proceeds of approximately $1,117.5 million from the offerings which we used primarily to retire debt during 2009.  Interest expense was temporarily impacted by the timing of our refinancing activities.  We retired early a major portion of the Companys debt maturing in 2011. Refer to Schedule C for a comparison of debt obligations as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009.
Interest expense
was $4.4 million, or $0.01 per share, as compared to $34.3 million, or $0.11 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The fourth quarter of 2009 includes loss on early retirement of debt of $53.7 million ($33.8 million or $0.11 per share after tax) and acquisition and integration costs of $13.9 million ($8.8 million or $0.03 per share after tax).  The fourth quarter 2009 decrease is primarily the result of loss on debt repurchases and increased interest expense, partially offset by an improvement in operating income.
Net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier
The Companys residential and business declined by approximately 34,200 during the fourth quarter of 2009.  At December 31, 2009, the Company had 2,117,500 residential and business access lines.
access lines
The Company added approximately 14,600 net during the fourth quarter of 2009 and had 635,900 High-Speed Internet customers at December 31, 2009. The Company added approximately 8,400 during the fourth quarter of 2009 and had 173,000 video customers at December 31, 2009.
High-Speed Internet customers
video customers
were $91.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $256.0 million for the full year of 2009, including $22.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $25.0 million for the full year of 2009 related to Verizon integration activities.
Capital expenditures
 
 
 
, as adjusted and defined by the Company in the attached Schedule B, was $284.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 resulting in an operating cash flow margin of 54.7 percent.  Operating cash flow, as reported, of $260.4 million has been adjusted to exclude $13.9 million of acquisition and integration costs, $1.2 million of severance and early retirement costs, and $9.4 million of non-cash pension costs for the fourth quarter of 2009.
Operating cash flow
, as defined by the Company in the attached Schedule A,was $123.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $490.8 million for the full year of 2009.  The Companys dividend represents a payout of 64 percent of free cash flow for the full year of 2009.
Free cash flow
 
For the full year of 2010, the Company expects that capital expenditures and free cash flow for its existing business operations, excluding acquisition/integration costs and capital expenditures, will be within a range of $220.0 million to $240.0 million and $450.0 million to $475.0 million, respectively.
The Companys next regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock will be paid on March 31, 2010 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2010.
The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow and operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Companys core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations, and its divisions measure performance and report to management based upon these measures.  In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments.  The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude $13.9 million and $28.3 million of acquisition and integration costs in the fourth quarter and full year of 2009, respectively, and $9.4 million and $0.4 million of non-cash pension costs in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $34.2 million of non-cash pension costs in the full year of 2009, because the Company believes that such costs in the fourth quarters and full years of 2009 and 2008 are unusual, and that the magnitude of such costs in the fourth quarter and full year of 2009 materially exceed the comparable costs in the fourth quarter and full year of 2008.  In addition, the Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude $1.2 million and $4.0 million of severance and early retirement costs in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively, $3.8 million and $7.6 million of severance and early retirement costs in the full years of 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $1.2 million and $2.1 million of legal settlement costs and related expenses in the fourth quarter and full year of 2008, respectively, because investors have indicated to management that such adjustments are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.
 
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Companys underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Companys ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures.  The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above.
While the Company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings.  In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure.  Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure.  Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.  The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
