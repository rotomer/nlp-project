On March 31, 2010, Frontier Communications Corporation (the Company) entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the Amended Employment Agreement) with Mary Agnes Wilderotter, the Companys Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, which amends certain terms contained in the employment agreement originally dated November 1, 2004, as amended and restated December 29, 2008, between the Company and Mrs. Wilderotter (the Initial Employment Agreement).  The Amended Employment Agreement reflects the mutual desire of Mrs. Wilderotter and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to address current best practices and concerns raised by stockholders as they relate to executive compensation and good governance.  The Amended Employmen t Agreement is also intended to reinforce the Companys pay for performance culture.
Accordingly, the Amended Employment Agreement:  (i) provides for a new three year term commencing March 31, 2010; (ii) eliminates Mrs. Wilderotters prior entitlement to guaranteed minimum annual equity awards; (iii) eliminates Mrs. Wilderotters prior entitlement to severance payments in the event the Company does not renew her employment agreement; (iv) eliminates the provision for additional payments to make Mrs. Wilderotter whole for any excise taxes under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (Mrs. Wilderotter is responsible to pay any required excise taxes); and (v) provides that Mrs. Wilderotter will serve as Chairman of the Board during the term of the Amended Employment Agreement but will not have good reason to terminate her employment in the event that she ceases to serve as such due to legislative or regulatory requirements, or as a result of mutual agreement between Mrs. Wilderotter and the Company.  The Amended Employment Agreement also provides for an increase in annual base salary to $1,000,000 and an increase in target annual bonus opportunity to 135% of base salary, in each case upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 13, 2009, as amended, by and among Verizon Communications Inc., New Communications Holdings Inc. and the Company.  Other than the changes described above, the Amended Employee Agreement is similar to the Initial Employment Agreement in all material respects.
The foregoing description of the Amended Employment Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the Amended Employment Agreement itself, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, upon termination of Executives employment for any reason other than death or Disability, Executive shall not receive any payments or benefits to which she may be entitled hereunder (other than those which by law cannot be subject to the execution of a release, which shall be paid without regard to any release either (A) at the time when due, or (B) as of Executives Termination Date, if the specific payment or benefit is subject to Section 409A and a payment date sufficient to satisfy Section 409A is not otherwise stated for such payment or benefit) unless Executive satisfies the release requirements of this Section 8(f)(ii).

The Companys obligation under this Section 8(g) shall survive any termination of Executives em ployment hereunder or the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

12
 
c.           It is expressly understood and agreed that although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Section 9 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Agreement is an unenforceable restriction against Executive, the provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enf orceable,such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.
 
10.           .
Confidentiality
 
a.           Executive will not at any time (whether during or after Executives employment with the Company) (i) retain or use for the benefit, purposes or account of Executive or any other Person; or (ii) other than in the course of performing services for the Company and in accordance with the Companys policies from time to time, disclose, divulge, reveal, communicate, share, transfer or provide access to any Person outside the Company (other than its professional advisers who are bound by confidentiality obligations), any non-public, proprietary or confidential information -- including without limitation rates, trade secrets, know-how, research and development, software, databases, inventions, processes, formulae, technology, designs and other intellectual propert y, information concerning finances, investments, profits, pricing, costs, products, services, vendors, customers, clients, partners, investors, personnel, compensation, recruiting, training, advertising, sales, marketing, promotions, government and regulatory activities and approvals -concerning the past, current or future business, activities and operations of the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates and/or any third party that has disclosed or provided any of same to the Company on a confidential basis (Confidential Information) without the prior written authorization of the Board.

d.           The provisions of this Section 10 shall survive the termination of Executives employment for any reason.
 
11.           . Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Employers remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 9 or Section 10 of this Agreement would be inadequate and the Company would suffer irreparable damages as a result of such breach or threatened breach. In recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to cease making any payments or providing any benefit otherwise required by this Agreement and obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.

n.
 
Meaning of Termination of Employment. Solely as necessary to comply with Section 409A and to this extent for purposes of Section 8(b)(ii), Section 8(b)(iii),Section 8(c)(iii), Section 8(d)(i), Section 8(f)(ii), Section 13(o), Section 13(p) and any other provision where this definition is specifically referenced, termination of employment shall have the same meaning as separation from service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code. In addition, to avoid having such a separation from service occur after the Executives termination of employment, the Executive shall not have (after the Executives termination of employmen t) any duties or responsibilities that are inconsistent with the termination of employment being treated as such a separation from service as of the date of such termination.
 
o.
 
Installment Payments. For purposes of Section 8(b)(ii)(B) with respect to amounts payable in the event of termination of employment on account of Disability and Section 8(c)(iii)(C) with respect to amount payable in the event of termination of Executives employment by the Company without Cause or by Executive with Good Reason or Constructive Termination Event, each such payment is a separate payment within the meaning of the final regulations under Section 409A. Each such payment that is made within 2-1/2 months following the end of the year that contains the date of Executives termination of employment is intended to be exempt from Section 409A as a short-term deferral within the meaning of the final regulations under Section 409A, each such payment that is made later than 2-1/2 months following the end of the year that contains the date of Executives termination of employment is intended to be exempt under the two-times exception of Treasury Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) up to the limitation on the availability of such exception specified in such regulation, and each such payment that is made after the two-times exception ceases to be available shall be subject to delay in accordance with Section 13(p) below.
 
p.
 
Section 409A. This Agreement will be construed and administered to preserve the exemption from Section 409A of payments that qualify as a short-term deferral or that qualify for the two-times exception. With respect to other amounts that are subject to Section 409A, it is intended, and this Agreement will be so construed, that any such amounts payable under this Agreement and the Companys and Executives exercise of authority or discretion hereunder shall comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the treasury regulations relating thereto so as not to subject Executive to the payment of interest and additional tax that may be imposed under Section 409A. As a result, in the event Executive is a specified employee on the date of Executives termination of employment (with such status determined by the Company in accordance with rules established by the Company in writing in advance of the specified employee identification date that relates to the date of Executives termination of employment or, if later, by December 31, 2008, or in the absence of such rules established by the Company, under the default rules for identifying specified employees under Section 409A), any payment that is subject to Section 409A, that is payable to Executive in connection with Executives termination of employment, shall not be paid earlier than six months after such termination of employment (if Executive dies after the date of Executives termination of employment but before any payment has been made, such remaining payments that were or could have been delayed will be paid to Executives estate without regard to such six-month delay). This Section 13(p) is an absolutely superseding provision under this Agreement. This means that it will apply notwithstanding other provisions in the Agreement that permit or require payment at an earlier time (and notwithstanding terms in such other provisions that may provide for their application without regard to other provisions of the Agreement).
 
q.
 
Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
