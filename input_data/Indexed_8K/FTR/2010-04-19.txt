           Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission Approves
                 Frontier Communications Acquisition of Verizon Local Wireline Operations
 
Frontier Communications Corporation (NYSE: FTR) reported today that its pending acquisition of Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) local wireline operations in the state of Washington has been unanimously approved by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.
STAMFORD, Conn., April 16, 2010 
Frontier looks forward to introducing its products and customer-first service to Washingtonians," said Dan McCarthy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Frontier.  We believe that access to broadband is connected to good jobs, education, health care, public safety and quality of life. We are committed to extending broadband reach and penetration, to offering value-added phone, video and Internet products and services, and to operating FiOS in 18 municipalities in the state.  Approval to transfer control of local cable TV franchises to Frontier for the FiOS markets in Washington was received in January 2010, subject to meeting certain conditions of such approvals.
Washington is the seventh state to approve the transaction, joining Oregon, Arizona, Frontier received all necessary approvals from authorities required to transfer control of local cable TV franchises to Frontier, subject to meeting certain conditions of such approvals. 
Ohio, Nevada, South Carolina and California.  In Oregon,
Regulators in Illinois and West Virginia and the Federal Communications Commission must approve the transaction or related transfers. 
On April 12, 2010, Frontier announced that New Communications Holdings Inc. ("Spinco"), a subsidiary of Verizon, had completed its private placement of $3.2 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes.  The gross proceeds of the offering were deposited into an escrow account.  Spinco intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the special cash payment to Verizon in connection with the spin-off of
 
 
 
Spinco to Verizon's shareholders and the subsequent merger of Spinco with and into Frontier.
The market has spoken, said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman and CEO of Frontier. The net proceeds from the offering are sufficient to fund the entire special cash payment that is one of the conditions to closing. The success of the offering is a gratifying demonstration of the continued confidence investors have in Frontier and our transformational transaction.
  
 
This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Senior Notes or any other securities, nor will there be any sale of the Senior Notes or any other securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.  The Senior Notes are issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and, outside of the United States, only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.  None of the Senior Notes have been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

Words such as believe, anticipate, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements (including oral representations) involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements.  These risks and uncertainties are based on a number of factors, including but not limited to:  Our ability to comple te the acquisition of access lines from Verizon; the failure to obtain, delays in obtaining or adverse conditions contained in any required regulatory approvals for the Verizon transaction; for two years after the merger, we may be limited in the amount of capital stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital; our indemnity obligation to Verizon may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us during the two year period following the merger in a transaction that our stockholders might consider favorable; the ability to successfully integrate the Verizon operations into Frontiers existing operations; the effects of increased expenses due to activities related to the Verizon transaction; the ability to successfully migrate Verizons West Virginia operations from Verizon owned and operated systems and processes to Frontier owned and operated systems and processes; the risk that the growth opportunities and cost synergies from the Verizon tran saction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the sufficiency of the assets to be acquired from Verizon to enable us to operate the acquired business; disruption from the Verizon transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; the effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product or service offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; reductions in the number of our access lines that cannot be offset by increases in High Speed Internet subscribers and sale of other products; our ability to sell enhanced and data services in order to offset ongoing declines in revenue from local services, switched access services and subsidies; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation; the effects of changes in the availability of federal and state un iversal funding to us and our competitors; the effects of competition from cable, wireless and other wireline carriers (through voice over internet protocol (VOIP) or otherwise); our ability to adjust successfully to changes in the communications industry and to implement strategies for growth; adverse changes in the credit markets or in the ratings given to
 
 
 
our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict the availability, or increase the cost, of financing; continued reductions in switched access revenues as a result of regulation, competition and/or technology substitutions; the effects of changes in both general and local economic conditions on the markets we serve, which can affect demand for our products and services, customer purchasing decisions, collectability of revenue and required levels of capital expenditures related to new construction of residences and businesses; our ability to effectively manage service quality; our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to our customers; changes in accounting polici es or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulators; our ability to effectively manage our operations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, and to repay, reduce or refinance our debt; the effects of bankruptcies and home foreclosures, which could result in difficulty in collection of revenues and loss of customers; the effects of technological changes and competition on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our ongoing network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; the effects of increased medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; changes in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, and/or federal or state tax assessments; the effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; our ability to successfull y renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2010 and beyond; declines in the value of our pension plan assets, which could require us to make contributions to the pension plan in 2011 and beyond; our ability to pay dividends in respect of our common shares, which may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes and our liquidity; the effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any of our current or future legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; the possible impact of adverse changes in political or other external factors over which we have no control; and the effects of hurricanes, ice storms or other natural disasters.  These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and the foregoing information should be read in conjunction with these fi lings.
