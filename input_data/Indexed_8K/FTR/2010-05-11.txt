On May 11, 2010, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 13, 2009, as amended (the Merger Agreement), by and among Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon), New Communications Holdings Inc. (Spinco), a subsidiary of Verizon formed for the purposes of holding defined assets and liabilities of the local exchange business and related landline activities of Verizon in 14 states, and Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier), Verizon informed Frontier through written notice that its designees to serve on the Frontier Board of Directors (the Designees) are Edward Fraioli, Pamela D.A. Reeve and Mark Shapiro.
 
On that same date, Frontier informed Verizon through written notice that all of its directors who are elected to serve at Frontiers annual meeting of stockholders on May 13, 2010 will continue to serve after the merger of Spinco with and into Frontier, except Lawton W. Fitt.  On May 10, 2010, Lawton W. Fitt notified Frontier that her resignation from Frontiers Board of Directors will be effective immediately prior to the merger.
 
Currently, Frontier has a twelve member Board of Directors with two vacancies as a result of the resignation of Michael T. Dugan in November 2009 and Kathleen Q. Abernathy in January 2010.  Upon Ms. Fitts resignation, there will be three vacancies on the Frontier Board of Directors.  Frontiers Board of Directors will elect the Designees to fill these vacancies on July 6, 2010, or if the merger of Spinco with and into Frontier were to close later, the day immediately prior to the effectiveness of the merger.
 
Following such elections, the Frontier Board of Directors will consist of twelve directors.
