the effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; our ability to successfully renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2010 and beyond; declines in the value of our pension plan assets, which could require us to make contributions to the pension plan in 2011 and beyond; our ability to pay dividends in respect of our common shares, which may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes and our liquidity; the effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any of our current or future legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; the possible impact of adverse changes in political or other external factors over which we have no control;

Frontier Communications Corporation (NYSE: FTR) is on track to complete its planned acquisition of Verizon wireline operations in 14 states on July 1, 2010, according to Dan McCarthy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the company.  Mr. McCarthys comments came as Frontier was praised by the Governor of West Virginia for its planned capital investment in the state.  At a press conference today at the State Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia, Governor Joe Manchin noted that this investment truly shows Frontiers commitment to West Virginia and its desire to bring the highest level of services to our citizens.
STAMFORD, Conn., June 15, 2010   
Also today, Frontier and the Communications Workers of America, District 2 (CWA) announced a settlement of all issues related to Frontiers acquisition of Verizon wireline operations and other assets in West Virginia.  Frontier will employ nearly 2,000 employees in West Virginia and will reinforce its commitment to the state through investment in infrastructure, expanded broadband deployment and a strong community presence.  Governor Manchin applauded Frontier for working with the CWA to expand existing opportunities and create new avenues for potential growth.
Mr. McCarthy noted, Great service starts with great employees, and we have made commitments to provide added job security in West Virginia.  The settlement with the CWA includes extending the Verizon union contract in West Virginia by two years, expanding job security to cover all Verizon union employees and, as previously communicated, fully honoring all existing Verizon labor contracts.  Frontier has committed to adding 150 new jobs to the West Virginia workforce in addition to establishing its Southeast Region headquarters
 
 
 
in Charleston, West Virginia.   Frontier has pledged to maintain a minimum union workforce level in West Virginia of 1,600 full-time CWA employees through August 2013.  In addition, Frontier will bring back to the United States approximately 500 Internet Help Desk jobs sent overseas by Verizon.  Frontier has a 100 percent U.S.-based workforce and hires locally to support the communities it serves.  All of these commitments are designed to establish the strongest workforce possible to serve the citizens of West Virginia.
Frontiers planned expenditures in West Virginia will be upwards of $310 million over the next 3-1/2 years, including $48 million on broadband deployment by December 31, 2013. These investments are consistent with Frontiers investment plan for these territories and include the expenditures shared with the West Virginia Public Service Commission (PSC) and required by the PSC order approving the transaction. Frontier has agreed to pre-fund a portion of this multi-year investment.  Mr. McCarthy noted that Frontier will have access to the $72.4 million that the PSC has ordered Verizon West Virginia Inc. to invest in service quality and ongoing broadband deployment and expects Frontier to have access to the $126 million in stimulus money the state has received from the federal government for communications and broadband deployment.
Our goal has always been, and continues to be, to put the customer first in West Virginia and in the 26 other states we will serve upon the closing of this transaction, said Mr. McCarthy.  Our investments here are business as usual for a company that will be the largest communications company in West Virginia and throughout rural America.
