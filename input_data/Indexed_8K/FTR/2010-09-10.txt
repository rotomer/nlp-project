Safe Harbor Statement Forward-Looking Language This presentation contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance. Words such as believe,anticipate,expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements (including oral representations) involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. These risks and uncertainties are based on a number of factors, including but not limited to: For two years after our acquisition of access lines from Verizon, we will be limited in the amount of capital stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital; our indemnity obligation to Verizon may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us during the two-year period following the merger in a transaction that stockholders might consider favorable; our ability to successfully integrate the Verizon operations into Frontiers existing operations; the effects of increased expenses incurred due to activities related to the integration of the Verizon operations; the risk that the growth opportunities and cost synergies from the Verizon transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; the effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product or service offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; reductions in the number of our access lines that cannot be offset by increases in high-speed Internet subscribers and sales of other products; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation; the effects of changes in the availability of federal and state universal funding to us and our competitors; the effects of competition from cable, wireless and other wireline carriers (through Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), DOCSIS 3.0, 4G or otherwise); our ability to adjust successfully to changes in the communications industry and to implement strategies for growth; adverse changes in the credit markets or in the ratings given to our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict the availability, or increase the cost, of financing; continued reductions in switched access revenues as a result of regulation, competition or technology substitutio ns; the effects of changes in both general and local economic conditions on the markets we serve, which can affect demand for our products and services, customer purchasing decisions, collectability of revenues and required levels of capital expenditures related to new construction of residences and businesses; our ability to effectively manage service quality in our territories; our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including the ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to customers; changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulations; our ability to manage effectively our operations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, and to repay, reduce or refinance our debt; the effects of bankruptcies and home foreclosures, which could result in difficulty in collection of revenues and loss of customers; the effects of technological changes and co mpetition on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; the effects of increased medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; changes in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, or federal or state tax assessments; the effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; our ability to successfully renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2010 and thereafter; declines in the value of our pension plan assets, which could require us to make contributions to the pension plans in 2011 and beyond; our ability to pay dividends on our common shares, which may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes and liquidity; the effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any of our current or future legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; the possible impact of adverse changes in political or other external factors over which we have no control; and the effects of hurricanes, tornados, ice storms or other natural or man-made disasters. These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and the foregoing information should be read in conjunction with these filings. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or to make any other forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise unless required to do so by securities laws.
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow, EBITDA or operating cash flow, which we define as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA; a reconciliation of the differences between EBITDA and free cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash f low needs. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Companys core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions, and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations, and its divisions measure performance and report to managemen t based upon these measures. In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and EBITDA, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude non-cash pension costs in 2009 and in the second quarter of and first six months of 2009 and 2010, acquisition and integration costs in 2009 and the second quarter and first six months of 2010, severance and early retirement costs in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 and in the second quarter and first six months of 2009 and 2010, a pension curtailment gain in 2007, the favorable impact of a significant carrier dispute settlement in 2007, and legal settlement costs and related expenses in 2007 and 2008 because the Company believes that the magnitude of such costs incurred in any one period materially exceeds that which has been incurred by the Company in any other period during 2005 through the first six months of 2010 and/or because investors have indicated to management that such adjustments are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Companys underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Companys ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above. While the Compan y utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons described above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings. In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure. EBITDA has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure. Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures. The information in this presentation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
 
 
Investment Summary Opportunity for Frontiers management to implement its innovative marketing and best-in-class margins on a business 3 times its size through the July 1, 2010 acquisition of 4 million access lines from Verizon. Markets that are primarily rural, have less competition, and are under- penetrated. Frontier will accelerate the rollout of its fast and reliable broadband network. Returns from a strong free cash model: revenue upside from increased product penetration, cost savings, a stable dividend with an attractive yield and a sustainable payout ratio. Credit Quality through a 2.5x deleveraging target with credit statistics nearing investment grade and a well structured maturity schedule.

Why This is Different from Other RBOC Line Divestitures System Conversion Experience 13 states run on a separate systems platform that came with SpinCo in the acquisition. Only West Virginia, representing 13% of SpinCo access lines, was converted to Frontier at closing. Deleveraging Transaction  This was a deleveraging transaction. Pro forma (12/31/09) combined net leverage of 2.6x  approaching investment grade over time. Strong Rural Markets Substantially the same rural profiles as Legacy Frontier. Predominately rural markets (37 households / sq. mile); less than 1% of the footprint is urban. Frontier already operates in 11 of the 14 states. Track Record of Successful Integrations Frontier management successfully operated a 2M + access line legacy business, generating $2.1B of revenue in 24 states. We have successfull y integrated Rochester Telephone, Commonwealth Telephone and Global Valley Networks and have consolidated 7 billing systems in the past 6 years.
