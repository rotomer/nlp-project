The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions except with respect to a successor Administrative Agent.
 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
 
(a)
 
 
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
 
(b)

 The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the Issuing Bank.
   
   
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presu me that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Bank prior to the issuance of such Letter of Credit.

The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent,
and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above, that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Bank directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph.  Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrat ive Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
provided
 
Each Lender and the Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and the Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02(b) with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Loan Documents.
 
 
40
 
To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax.  Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.09, each Lender (including any Issuing Bank for purposes of this paragraph) shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 30 days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding tax ineffective).  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this paragraph.  The agreements in this paragraph shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

To Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch,
as Administrative Agent, and the Lenders party
to the Credit Agreement referred to below
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am the Corporate Counsel of Frontier Communications Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ), and have acted as counsel in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of September 8, 2010 (the ), among the Borrower, the financial institutions referred to as Lenders in the LC Agreement (the ) and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as issuing bank and as administrative agent for the Lenders (the ).  This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the LC Agreement.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the LC Agreement.
Borrower
LC Agreement
Lenders
Administrative Agent
 
In that connection, I have examined, caused the examination of, or am otherwise familiar with, originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion, including:
 
(i)           the LC Agreement;
 
(ii)          the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower, as amended;
 
(iii)         the By-laws of the Borrower;
 
(iv)          resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Borrower on May 12, 2010; and
 
(v)           resolutions adopted by the Pricing Committee of the Borrower on August 15, 2010.
 
I have also relied, with respect to certain factual matters, on the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in the LC Agreement and have assumed compliance by the Borrower with the terms of the LC Agreement.
 
In rendering my opinion, I have assumed (a) the due authorization, execution and delivery of the LC Agreement by all parties thereto other than the Borrower and (b) that each party to the LC Agreement (other than the Borrower) has the full power, authority and legal right to enter into and perform its obligations under the LC Agreement.  Wherever the phrases to my knowledge or known to me are used in this opinion they refer to my actual knowledge and the actual knowledge of the attorneys employed by the Borrower who were involved in the representation of the Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated by the LC Agreement.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications hereinafter set forth, I am of the opinion as follows:
 
 
1.          The Borrower (a) is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (b) has the requisite power and authority to own its property and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and (c) is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the failure to qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
2.          The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the LC Agreement and the performance of its obligations thereunder, will not (a) violate any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation that I have, in the exercise of customary professional diligence, recognized as applicable to the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or to transactions of the type contemplated by the LC Agreement (including the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), (b) violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the By-Laws of the Borrower, (c) violate, to my knowledge, any order of any court or of any other agent of government binding upon the Borrower, (d) violate, be in conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (alone or with notice or lapse of time or both) a default under (i) any agreement or other instrument binding on the Borrower or by which the Borrower or any of its properties or assets are or may be bound that was filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 filed by the Borrower with the Securities and Exchange Commission or (ii) any agreement or other instrument evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money of the Borrower (collectively, the ) and (e) will not result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any property or assets of the Borrower.  In connection with the foregoing, I point out that certain of the Material Agreements are or may be governed by laws other than the laws of the State of New York. &# 160;For purposes of the opinion expressed in this paragraph, my opinion is based solely upon my understanding, of the plain language of such Material Agreements, and I do not express any opinion as to the validity, binding nature or enforceability of any such Material Agreement, and I do not assume any responsibility with respect to the effect on my opinion of any interpretation thereof inconsistent with such understanding.  My opinion also does not extend to compliance by the Borrower with any financial ratio or limitation in any Material Agreement expressed as a dollar amount (or an amount expressed in another currency).
Material Agreements
 
3.           No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to, consent of, order of or filing with, the Federal Communications Commission or any other United States federal or state governmental authority that I have, in the exercise of customary professional diligence, recognized as having authority over the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is required to be made or obtained by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution delivery and performance by the Borrower of the LC Agreement, other than (i) such reports to United States governmental authorities regarding international capital and foreign currency translations as may be required pursuant to 31 C.F.R. Part 128, (ii) those that have been made or obtained and are in full force and e ffect or as to which failure to be made or obtained or to be in full force and effect should not result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect or an adverse
 
 
 
 
-3-
 
effect on the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the LC Agreement or any other Loan Document, (iii) those that may be required by any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit issued under the LC Agreement and (iv) such registrations, filings and approvals that may be required because of the legal or regulatory status of any Lender or because of any other facts specifically pertaining to any Lender.
 
4.           There is no action, suit or proceeding, or any governmental investigation or any arbitration, in each case pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened against the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or any material property of any thereof before any court or arbitrator or any governmental or administrative body, agency or official which (i) challenges the validity of the LC Agreement or (ii) except as disclosed in the Borrowers Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 or its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 may be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
5.           The Borrower is not an investment company as defined in or subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
I express no opinion as to the status of the obligations of the Borrower under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code and applicable state fraudulent conveyance laws.
 
I am admitted to practice only in the State of New York, and I express no opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America.
 
This opinion is rendered only to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the LC Agreement and is solely for their benefit in connection with the above transactions.  I am opining as to the matters herein only as of the date hereof, and, while you are authorized to deliver copies of this opinion to such permitted assigns of any Lender and they are permitted to rely on this opinion, the rights to do so do not imply any obligation on my part to update this opinion.  This opinion may not be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose; that this opinion may be circulated or quoted as required under applicable law or re gulation (including pursuant to any applicable judicial or governmental order) and to your actual or prospective successors and assigns.

Credit Agreement dated as of September 8, 2010
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special New York counsel to Frontier Communications Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ), in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of September 8, 2010 (the ), among the Borrower, the lending institutions party thereto (the ) and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, as issuing bank and as administrative agent for the Lenders (the ).  This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 4.01(c) of the LC Agreement.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the LC Agreement.
Borrower
LC Agreement
Lenders
Administrative Agent
 
In that connection, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion, including:
 
(i)           the LC Agreement,
 
(ii)           the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower,
 
(iii)           the By-laws of the Borrower,
 
(iv)           resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Borrower on May 12, 2010; and
 
(v)           resolutions adopted by the Pricing Committee of the Borrower on August 15, 2010.
 
We have also relied, with respect to certain factual matters, on the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in the LC Agreement and have assumed compliance by the Borrower with the terms of the LC Agreement.
 
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed (a) the genuineness of all signatures, (b) that each party to the LC Agreement other than the Borrower has all necessary power, authority and legal right to execute and deliver the LC Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder and that the LC Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto other than the Borrower, (c) the due authorization, execution and delivery of the LC Agreement by all parties thereto other than the Borrower, (d) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, (e) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies and (f) that insofar as any obligation under the LC Agreement is to be performed in, or by a part y
organized under the laws of, any jurisdiction outside the State of New York, its performance will not be illegal or ineffective in any jurisdiction by virtue of the law of that jurisdiction.
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications hereinafter set forth, we are of opinion as follows:
 
1.           Based solely on a certificate from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, the Borrower is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.  The Borrower has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the LC Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder.
 
2.           (a)  The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the performance by the Borrower of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Borrower.
 
(b) The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the LC Agreement and the performance by the Borrower of its obligations thereunder do not violate any law, rule or regulation of the United States of America, the State of New York or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
3.           The LC Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower.  The LC Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, subject in each case to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity (including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing), regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.  The foregoing opinion is subject to the following qualifications:  (i) insofar as provisions contain ed in the LC Agreement provide for indemnification or limitations on liability, the enforceability thereof may be limited by public policy considerations, (ii) the availability of a decree for specific performance or an injunction is subject to the discretion of the court requested to issue any such decree or injunction and (iii) we express no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York where any Lender may be located or where enforcement of the LC Agreement may be sought that limit the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.
 
We express no opinion herein as to any provision in the LC Agreement that (a) relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of any Federal court of the United States of America, or any Federal appellate court, to adjudicate any controversy related to the LC Agreement (such as the provision found in Section 9.09(b) of the LC Agreement), (b) contains a waiver of an inconvenient forum (such as the provision found in Section 9.09(c) of the LC Agreement), (c) relates to a right of setoff in respect of purchases of participations in LOC Disbursements (such as the provision found in Section 2.06 of the LC Agreement) or with respect to parties that may not hold mutual debts (such as the provision found in Section 9.08 of the LC Agreement), (d) provides for liquidated damages or penalty interest, (e) rela tes to the waiver of rights to jury trial (such as the provision found in Section 9.10 of the LC Agreement) or (f) relates to any arrangement or similar
 
 
 
 
fee payable to any agent (including the Administrative Agent) of the commitments or loans under the LC Agreement or any fee not set forth in the LC Agreement.  We also express no opinion as to (i) the enforceability of the provisions of the LC Agreement to the extent that such provisions constitute a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations or any other defense to performance which cannot, as a matter of law, be effectively waived, (ii) whether a state court outside the State of New York or a Federal court of the United States would give effect to the choice of New York law provided for in the LC Agreement or (iii) compliance with, or the application or effect of, Federal or state securities laws or regulations or any laws or regulations relating to the ownership or operation o f communications (whether cellular, wireless, broadband, radio or otherwise) licenses, assets or systems or the provision of communications products or services to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or the necessity of any authorization, approval or action by, or any notice to, consent of, order of, or filing with, the Federal Communications Commission or any other governmental authority, pursuant to any such laws or regulations.
 
We understand that you are satisfying yourselves as to the status under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code and applicable state fraudulent conveyance laws of the obligations of the Borrower under the LC Agreement, and we express no opinion thereon.
 
We are admitted to practice only in the State of New York, and we express no opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal law of the United States of America.
 
This opinion is rendered only to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders party to the LC Agreement on the date hereof and is solely for their benefit in connection with the above transactions.  In addition, we hereby consent to reliance on this opinion solely by a counterparty to a credit default swap entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents solely in the event a Credit Event has occurred; that such counterparty becomes a counterparty to such credit default swap on or prior to the 30 date after the date of this opinion.  We are opining as to the matters herein only as of the date here of, and, while you are authorized to deliver copies of this opinion to such permitted assignees and they are permitted to rely on this opinion, the rights to do so do not imply any obligation on our part to update this opinion.  This opinion may not be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.
