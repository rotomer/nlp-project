Safe Harbor Statement
Forward-Looking Language
This document contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements.  Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Words such as "believe," "anticipate," "expect" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements (including oral representations) are only predictions or statements of current plans, which we review continuously.  Forward-looking statements may differ from actual future results due to, but not limited to, and our future results may be materially affected by, potential risks or uncertainties.  You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all potential risks or uncertainties.  We note the following as a partial list: limitations on the amount of capital stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital during the two years after the Merger; our indemnity obligation to Verizon for taxes which may be imposed upon them as a result of changes in ownership of our stock may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us during the two-year period following the merger in a transaction that stockholders might consider favorable; our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business into Frontier's existing operations; the effects of increased expenses incurred due to activities related to the transaction and the integration of the acquired business; the risk that the growth opportunities and cost synergies from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; the effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product or service offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; reductions in the number of our access lines that cannot be offset by increases in High-Speed Internet (HSI) subscribers and sales of other products and services; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation; the effects of changes in the availability of federal and state universal funding to us and our competitors; the effects of competition from cable, wireless and other wireline carriers (through Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), DOCSIS 3.0, 4G or otherwise); our ability to adjust successfully to changes in the communications industry and to implement strategies for growth; adverse changes in the credit markets or in the ratings given to our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict the availability, or increase the cost, of financing; continued reductions in switched access revenues as a result of regulation, competition or technology substitutions; our ability to effectively manage service quality in our territories and meet mandated service quality metrics; our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to customers; changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulations; our ability to effectively manage our operations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, and to repay, reduce or refinance our debt; the effects of changes in both general and local economic conditions on the markets that we serve, which can affect demand for our products and services, customer purchasing decisions, collectability of revenues and required levels of capital expenditures related to new construction of residences and businesses; the effects of customer bankruptcies and home foreclosures, which could result in difficulty in collection of revenues and loss of customers; the effects of technological changes and competition on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; the effects of increased medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; changes in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, or federal or state tax assessments; the effects of state regulatory cash management policies on our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and to the parent company; our ability to successfully renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2010 and thereafter; declines in the value of our pension plan assets, which would require us to make increased contributions to the pension plan in 2011 and beyond; our ability to pay dividends on our common shares, which may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes and liquidity; the effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any current or future legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; the possible impact of adverse changes to regulatory requirements imposed by various political bodies or other external factors over which we have no control; and the effects of severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornados, ice storms or other natural or man-made disasters.  These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and the foregoing information should be read in conjunction with these filings.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or to make any other forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise unless required to do so by securities laws.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance.  These include free cash flow, EBITDA or "operating cash flow", which we define as operating income plus depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA; a reconciliation of the differences between EBITDA and free cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow.  The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Company's core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to plan and measure the performance of its core operations, and its divisions measure performance and report to management based upon these measures. In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and EBITDA, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments.  
The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude $78.5 million and $3.7 million of acquisition and integration costs in the third quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $125.9 million and $14.5 million of acquisition and integration costs in the first nine months of 2010 and 2009, respectively, because the Company believes that such costs in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 are unusual, and that the magnitude of such costs in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 materially exceed the comparable costs in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009.  In addition, the Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude $12.1 million and $8.4 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the third quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $24.2 million and $24.8 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the first nine months of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $7.0 million of severance and early retirement costs in the third quarter of 2010, and $7.7 million and $2.6 million of severance and early retirement costs in the first nine months of 2010 and 2009, respectively, because investors have indicated to management that such adjustments are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Company's underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Company's ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures.  The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful and useful for the reasons outlined above.
While the Company utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes that they are useful to management and to investors for the reasons outlined above, these non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings.  In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure.  EBITDA has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure.  Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.  The information in this document should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Systems Integration Plan
System mapping and analysis in process
Systems are identical across all 13 states; processes on the first conversions will be replicated
Initial expectation is a few states in the second half of 2011, and the remaining states in two groups by end of 2012
Successful conversion despite a firm July 1 deadline
Billing cycles kept within days of prior scheduled dates, and all systems functional out of the gate
Backlog managed downward with "bubble workforce" and current levels within normal range
Frontier 13
West Virginia
Frontier converted West Virginia, which utilized BellAtlantic systems, on July 1, 2010
The remaining 13 states of the acquired properties (detailed in the appendix) will be converted off Verizon (GTE) systems onto existing Frontier systems by the end of 2012
16
Financing Overview
Deleveraged from 4.0x (6/30/10) to 2.8x (9/30/10)
Strong $1.0 billion liquidity with an undrawn $750M R/C and $250M minimum cash-on-hand objective
Maturity schedule is well balanced and below run rate FCF levels
Free cash flow levels match well with scheduled debt amortization.
