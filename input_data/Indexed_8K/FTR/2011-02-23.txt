 Frontier Communications Corporation (NYSE:FTR) today reported fourth-quarter 2010 revenue of $1,358.7 million, operating income of $239.7 million and net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier of $46.0 million, or $0.05 per share. After excluding $11.3 million for acquisition and integration costs, net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier for the fourth quarter of 2010 would have been $53.0 million, or $0.05 per share.
Stamford, Conn., February 23, 2011
I am pleased with the solid progress we continue to make after the Verizon acquisition.  Our focus on streamlining processes and local engagement resulted in strong customer metrics  including reduced churn of access line customers, and improvements in high-speed internet, video and commercial sales, said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman and CEO of Frontier Communications.  We also increased our broadband availability in the new markets by 240,000 households, are well into our conversion planning for the next 4 states and took an additional $52 million of annualized synergies out of the business.
for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $1,358.7 million as compared to $521.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Revenue of $857.9 million is attributable to the July 1, 2010 acquired properties for the three months ended December 31, 2010.  The decline of $20.2 million for our Frontier legacy operations results from decreases in local and long distance services revenue and switched access revenue, partially offset by an increase of $9.4 million in data and internet services revenue.
Revenue
At December 31, 2010, the Company had 3,445,200 and 343,800 . The Company grew its by approximately 5,600during the fourth quarter of 2010, consisting of 1,500 net additions for Frontier legacy operations and 4,100 net additions for the acquired properties, and had 1,697,200 high-speed internet customers at December 31, 2010. The Company had net additions of approximately 15,800 during the fourth quarter of 2010, and had 531,400 video customers at December 31, 2010.

for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $755.0 million as compared to $246.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Network access expenses and other operating expenses of $507.6 million are associated with the acquired properties.
Network access expenses and other operating expenses
for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $352.8 million as compared to $102.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter of 2010 includes $130.0 million of depreciation expense and $123.1 million of amortization expense as a result of the acquired properties.
Depreciation and amortization
of approximately $11.3 million ($0.01 per share after tax) were incurred and expensed during the fourth quarter of 2010, as compared to approximately $13.9 million ($0.03 per share after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2009, in connection with our acquisition of approximately 4.0 million access lines (as of July 1, 2010).  These costs in the fourth quarter of 2010 were incurred in connection with our activities to complete the integration of the West Virginia operations, commence the conversion of remaining systems and other ongoing integration work.
Acquisition and integration costs
for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $239.7 million and operating income margin was 17.6 percent as compared to operating income of $157.5 million and operating income margin of 30.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The fourth quarter 2010 increase of $82.2 million is primarily the result of incremental operating income from the recently acquired properties.
Operating income
for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $167.5 million as compared to $94.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, a $73.3 million increase.  Interest expense was higher in 2010 due to the $3.5 billion of additional debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of the acquired properties.
Interest expense
for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $26.2 million as compared to $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, a $21.6 million increase.
Income tax expense
was $46.0 million, or $0.05 per share, as compared to $4.4 million, or $0.01 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The fourth quarter of 2010 includes acquisition and integration costs of $11.3 million ($7.0 million or $0.01 per share after tax).  The fourth quarter 2010 increase is primarily the result of incremental operating income from the recently acquired properties and higher other income (as the fourth quarter of 2009 reflected a loss of $53.7 million ($33.8 million or $0.11 per share after tax) recognized on the early retirement of debt), partially offset by increased interest expense and income tax expense.  The change in basic net income per share was primarily due to the highe r net income, as discussed above, mostly offset by the increase in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the issuance of 678.5 million shares in connection with our acquisition of the acquired properties.
Net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier
were $247.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $577.9 million for the full year of 2010, including $19.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $97.0 million for the full year of 2010 related to integration activities.
Capital expenditures
, as adjusted and defined by the Company in the attached Schedule B, was $622.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 resulting in an operating cash flow margin of 45.8 percent.  Operating cash flow, as reported, of $592.5 million has been adjusted to exclude $11.3 million of acquisition and integration costs, $15.8 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and $2.7 million of severance and early retirement costs for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Operating cash flow

, as defined by the Company in the attached Schedule A,was $212.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $838.3 million for the full year of 2010.  The Companys dividend represents a payout of 63 percent of free cash flow for the full year of 2010.
Free cash flow
 
For the full year of 2011, the Companys expectations for capital expenditures and free cash flow, excluding acquisition/integration costs and capital expenditures, to be within a range of $750 million to $780 million and $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion, respectively.  We expect that in 2011 our cash taxes will be approximately $50 million to $75 million.
The Companys next regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.1875 per share of common stock will be paid on March 31, 2011 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2011.
Pro Forma Information
As a convenience to investors, the Company furnished today on a Current Report on Form 8-K unaudited pro forma combined historical financial and operating data for the Company, including financial and operating data for the acquired properties, updated to reflect the actual financial and operating data for the fourth quarter of 2010.

The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow and operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Companys core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.  In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can ass ist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments.  The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude $11.3 million and $13.9 million of acquisition and integration costs in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $137.1 million and $28.3 million of acquisition and integration costs in the full year of 2010 and 2009, respectively, because the Company believes that such costs in the fourth quarters and full years of 2010 and 2009 are unusual, and that the magnitude of such costs in the full year of 2010 materially exceed the comparable costs in the full year of 2009.  In addition, the Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude $15.8 million and $9.4 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $40.1 million and $34.2 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the full years of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $2.7 million and $1.2 million of severance and early retirement costs in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $10.4 million and $3.8 million of severance and early retirement costs in the full years of 2010 and 2009, respectively, because investors have indicated to management that such adjustments are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Companys underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Companys ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings.  In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure.  Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure.  Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.  The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
