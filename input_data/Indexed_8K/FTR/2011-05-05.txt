 Frontier Communications Corporation (NYSE:FTR) today reported first-quarter 2011 revenue of $1,346.7 million, operating income of $250.6 million and net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier of $54.7 million, or $0.05 per share. After excluding $13.2 million for acquisition and integration costs, net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier for the first quarter of 2011 would have been $63.0 million, or $0.06 per share.
Stamford, CT, May 5, 2011
Frontiers strong operating metrics and stabilized revenues this quarter were driven by continued broadband expansion and local customer engagement, said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman & CEO of Frontier Communications. To date, Frontiers team has built broadband to 323,000 new homes while achieving $368 million of annualized cost savings.  We are confident in our ability to reach our $550 million cost savings target and eliminate additional expenses from the business.  With approximately 575,000 homes remaining in our build out plan through midyear 2013, we also expect further improvements in residential and commercial customer revenues, while maintaining healthy cash flow to support our dividend.
 
for the first quarter of 2011 was $1,346.7 million as compared to $1,358.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $519.9 million in the first quarter of 2010.  The increase in revenue for the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the first quarter of 2010 is attributable to $841.8 million in revenue associated with the July 1, 2010 acquired properties, partially offset by a decline of $14.9 million for our Frontier legacy operations results.
Revenue
At March 31, 2011, the Company had 3,338,300 and 333,400 . The Company grew its by approximately 10,500during the first quarter of 2011, and had 1,707,700 high-speed internet customers at March 31, 2011. The Company had net additions of approximately 15,000 during the first quarter of 2011, and had 546,400 video customers at March 31, 2011.

for the first quarter of 2011 was $351.3 million as compared to $352.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $101.0 million in the first quarter of 2010. The first quarter of 2011 includes $132.8 million of depreciation expense and $118.1 million of amortization expense as a result of the acquired properties.
Depreciation and amortization
of approximately $13.2 million ($0.01 per share after tax) were incurred and expensed during the first quarter of 2011, as compared to approximately $10.4 million ($0.02 per share after tax) in the first quarter of 2010, in connection with our acquisition. The costs in the first quarter of 2011 were incurred in connection with our activities to convert the next phase of systems and other ongoing network integration work.
Acquisition and integration costs
for the first quarter of 2011 was $250.6 million and operating income margin was 18.6 percent as compared to operating income of $239.7 million and operating income margin of 17.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 and operating income of $161.9 million and operating income margin of 31.1 percent in the first quarter of 2010.  The first quarter 2011 increase from first quarter 2010 of $88.7 million is primarily the result of incremental operating income from the acquired properties.
Operating income
for the first quarter of 2011 was $167.4 million as compared to $93.8 million in the first quarter of 2010, a $73.6 million increase.  Interest expense was higher in 2011 due to the $3.5 billion of additional debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of the acquired properties.
Interest expense
for the first quarter of 2011 was $36.6 million as compared to $32.1 million in the first quarter of 2010, a $4.5 million increase, primarily due to higher taxable income as a result of the acquired properties, partially offset by the impact of a $4.1 million one-time charge in the first quarter of 2010.
Income tax expense
was $54.7 million, or $0.05 per share, as compared to $42.6 million, or $0.14 per share, in the first quarter of 2010.  The first quarter of 2011 includes acquisition and integration costs of $13.2 million ($8.3 million or $0.01 per share after tax).  The first quarter 2011 increase is primarily the result of incremental operating income from the acquired properties, partially offset by increased interest expense.  The change in basic net income per share was primarily due to the higher net income, as discussed above, mostly offset by the increase in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the issuance of 678.5 million shares in connection with our acquisition of the acquired properties.
Net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier
were $209.1 million for the first quarter of 2011, including $5.6 million related to integration activities.
Capital expenditures

Operating cash flow, as reported, of $601.8 million has been adjusted to exclude $13.2 million of acquisition and integration costs, $11.3 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and $0.1 million of severance and early retirement costs for the first quarter of 2011.
Operating cash flow
, as defined by the Company in the attached Schedule A,was $252.8 million for the first quarter of 2011.  The Companys dividend represents a payout of 74 percent of free cash flow for the first quarter of 2011.

The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow and operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
 
The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Companys core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.  In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments.  The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude $13.2 million, $10.4 million and $11.3 million of acquisition and integration costs in the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 and December 31, 2010, respectively, $11.3 million, $7.3 million and $15.8 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $2.7 million of severance and early retirement costs in the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 and December 31, 2010, respectively, because investors have indicated to management that such adjustments are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Companys underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Companys ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings.  In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure.  Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure.  Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.  The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
