 Frontier Communications Corporation (NYSE:FTR) today reported second-quarter 2011 revenue of $1,322.3 million, operating income of $238.3 million and net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier of $32.3 million, or $0.03 per share. After excluding $20.3 million for acquisition and integration costs, $11.0 million for severance and early retirement costs and $10.5 million for a discrete tax item, net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier for the second quarter of 2011 would have been $62.2 million, or $0.06 per share.
Stamford, CT, August 3, 2011
The one year anniversary of Frontiers transformational acquisition demonstrated a solid turnaround in operations and improved profitability, said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman & CEO of Frontier Communications. Our broadband network has now been expanded to 466,000 new homes, a rich opportunity that were only beginning to penetrate, and our business revenue pipeline is solid across all market segments.  We have achieved $424 million of annualized cost savings and are increasing our target to $600 million.  Frontier has a great market opportunity ahead of it which, when combined with our cost discipline, will continue to reward our stakeholders with a stronger capital structure and a stable dividend.
for the second quarter of 2011 was $1,322.3 million as compared to $1,346.7 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $516.1 million in the second quarter of 2010.  The increase in revenue for the second quarter of 2011 as compared to the second quarter of 2010 is attributable to $825.3 million in revenue associated with the July 1, 2010 acquired properties, partially offset by a decline of $19.2 million for our Frontier legacy operations results.
Revenue
At June 30, 2011, the Company had 3,252,000 and 326,800 . The Company grew its by approximately 7,400during the second quarter of 2011, which includes a net loss of 4,900 FiOS data customers.

Network access expenses included promotional gift costs of $9.8 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2011.   Other operating expenses included severance and early retirement costs of $11.0 million in the second quarter of 2011 and the six months ended June 30, 2011.  Network access expenses and other operating expenses of $481.6 million and $493.3 million are associated with the acquired properties for the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2011, respectively.

for the second quarter of 2011 was $359.0 million as compared to $351.3 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $100.0 million in the second quarter of 2010. The second quarter of 2011 includes $140.4 million of depreciation expense and $119.6 million of amortization expense as a result of the acquired properties.
Depreciation and amortization
of approximately $20.3 million ($0.01 per share after tax) were incurred and expensed during the second quarter of 2011, as compared to approximately $13.2 million ($0.01 per share after tax) in the first quarter of 2011 and $37.0 million ($0.08 per share after tax) in the second quarter of 2010, in connection with our acquisition of the acquired properties. The costs in the second quarter of 2011 were incurred in connection with our activities to convert the next phase of systems and other ongoing network integration work.
Acquisition and integration costs
for the second quarter of 2011 was $238.3 million and operating income margin was 18.0 percent as compared to operating income of $250.6 million and operating income margin of 18.6 percent in the first quarter of 2011 and operating income of $136.4 million and operating income margin of 26.4 percent in the second quarter of 2010.  The second quarter 2011 increase from second quarter 2010 of $101.9 million is primarily the result of incremental operating income from the acquired properties.  After excluding $20.3 million and $33.5 million for acquisition and integration costs and $11.0 million for severance and early retirement costs in each period, operating income and operating income margin for the three months ended June 30, 2011 would have been $269.5 million and 20.4 percent, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2011 would have been $533.4 million and 20.0 percent, respectively.
Operating income
for the second quarter of 2011 was $166.9 million as compared to $94.0 million in the second quarter of 2010, a $72.9 million increase.  Interest expense was higher in 2011 due to the $3.5 billion of additional debt assumed in connection with the July 1, 2010 acquisition of the acquired properties.
Interest expense
for the second quarter of 2011 was $37.2 million as compared to $16.3 million in the second quarter of 2010, a $20.9 million increase, primarily due to higher taxable income as a result of the acquired properties and a $10.5 million charge resulting from the enactment on May 25, 2011 of the Michigan Corporate Income Tax which eliminated certain future tax deductions.
Income tax expense
was $32.3 million, or $0.03 per share, as compared to $35.1 million, or $0.11 per share, in the second quarter of 2010.  The second quarter of 2011 includes acquisition and integration costs of $20.3 million, severance and early retirement costs of $11.0 million and a $10.5 million discrete tax item (combined impact of $29.9 million or $0.03 per share after tax).  The second quarter 2011 decrease is primarily the result of increased interest expense and income tax expense, mostly offset by incremental operating income from the acquired properties.  The change in basic net income per share was primarily due to the increase in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the issuance of 678.5 million shares in connection with the July 1, 2010 acquisition of the acquired properties.
Net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier
were $223.9 million for the second quarter of 2011 and $433.0 million for the first six months of 2011, including $13.4 million for the second quarter of 2011 and $19.0 million for the first six months of 2011 related to integration activities.

Pro Forma Information
As a convenience to investors, the Company furnished today on a Current Report on Form 8-K unaudited pro forma combined historical financial and operating data for the Company, including financial and operating data for the acquired properties, updated to reflect the actual financial and operating data for the second quarter of 2011.
The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow and operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Companys core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.  In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments.  The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude: $20.3 million, $37.0 million and $13.2 million of acquisition and integration costs in the quarters ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 and March 31, 2011, respectively, and $33.5 million and $47.3 million of acquisition and integration costs in the first six months of 2011 and 2010, respectively; $5.3 million, $4.8 million and $11.3 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the quarters ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 and March 31, 2011, respectively, and $16.6 million and $12.2 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the first six months of 2011 and 2010, respectively; and $11.0 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million of severance and early retirement costs in the quarters ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 and March 31, 2011, respectively, and $11.0 million and $0.7 million of severance and early retirement costs in the first six months of 2011 and 2010, respectively, because investors have indicated to management that such adjustments are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Companys underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Companys ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures.

These non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings.  In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure.  Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure.  Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.  The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
