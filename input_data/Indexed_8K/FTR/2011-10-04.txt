Frontier Communications Corporation (NYSE: FTR) paid its Third-Quarter dividend to shareholders on Friday, September 30, 2011 and announced today that its Board of Directors has reaffirmed its current intention to maintain the annual dividend of $0.75 per share of the Companys common stock.
STAMFORD, Conn., October 3, 2011 --
We remain committed to the return of capital to our shareholders at the dividend level announced in May 2009 and believe our ability to do so will be enhanced by delivering on the cost synergies of the Verizon property acquisition completed a little over a year ago, said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  In addition, our third-quarter 2011 broadband unit growth was stronger than the prior quarter.  Our 2011 free cash flow guidance of $1.075 to $1.125 billion sufficiently covers an annual dividend of approximately $746 million, and we look to enhance this payout ratio through further synergy realization, the completion of our broadband network expansion, and our continued improvement in our sales and retention initiatives.  Systems conversions are a primary driver of cost synergies and we are pleased to report that we began conversion of the next four states on October 1, 2011 and expect to finish the remaining nine states in the first half of 2012.
Declarations and payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors, and will depend on many factors, including the Companys financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law, restrictions in its credit facilities, and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.

Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance.  Words such as believe, anticipate, expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements (including oral representations) involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements.  These risks and uncertainties are based on a number of factors, including but not limited to:  Our ability to successfully integrate the operations and systems of the acquired business into Frontiers existing operations; the risk that the growth opportunities and cost synergies from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected;  our indemnity obligation to Verizon for taxes which may be imposed upon them as a result of changes in ownership of our stock may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us during the two-year period ending July 2012 in a transaction that stockholders might consider favorable; the effects of increased expenses incurred due to activities related to the integration of the acquired business; most of the acquired business operates on systems acquired in the transaction, which may not continue to function properly following the first group of conversions to our legacy systems; our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; the effects of greater than anticipated competition requiring new pricing, marketing strategies or new product or service offerings and the risk that we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; reductions in the number of our access lines that cannot be offset by increases in High-Speed Internet (HSI) subscribers and sales of other products and services; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry as a result of federal and state legislation and regulation, or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of such legislation and regulation; the effects of any unfavorable outcome with respect to any current or future legal, governmental or regulatory proceedings, audits or disputes; the effects of changes in the availability of federal and state universal funding to us and our competitors; the effects of competition from cable, wireless and other wireline carriers; our ability to adjust successfully to changes in the communications industry and to implement strategies for growth; continued reductions in switched access revenues as a result of regulation, competition or technology substitutions; our ability to effectively manage service quality in our territories and meet mandated service quality metrics; our ability to successfully introduce new product offerings, including our ability to offer bundled service packages on terms that are both profitable to us and attractive to customers; changes in accounting policies or practices adopted voluntarily or as required by generally accepted accounting principles or regulations; our ability to effectively manage our operations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, and to repay, reduce or refinance our debt; the effects of changes in both general and local economic conditions on the markets that we serve, which can affect demand for our products and services, customer purchasing decisions, collectability of revenues and required levels of capital expenditures related to new construction of residences and businesses; the effects of technological changes and competition on our capital expenditures and product and service offerings, including the lack of assurance that our network improvements will be sufficient to meet or exceed the capabilities and quality of competing networks; the effects of increased medical, retiree and pension expenses and related funding requirements; changes in income tax rates, tax laws, regulations or rulings, or federal or state tax assessments; the effects of state regulatory cash management practices that could limit our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries or dividend funds up to the parent company; our ability to successfully renegotiate union contracts expiring in 2011 and thereafter; changes in pension plan assumptions and/or the value of our pension plan assets, which would require us to make increased contributions to the pension plan in 2012 and beyond; the effects of customer bankruptcies and home foreclosures, which could result in difficulty in collection of revenues and loss of customers; adverse changes in the credit markets or in the ratings given to our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or restrict the availability, or increase the cost, of financing; limitations on the amount of capital stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital until July 2012; our ability to pay dividends on our common shares, which may be affected by our cash flow from operations, amount of capital expenditures, debt service requirements, cash paid for income taxes and liquidity; and the effects of severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornados, ice storms or other natural or man-made disasters.  These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and the foregoing information should be read in conjunction with these filings.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or to make any other forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise unless required to do so by securities laws.
