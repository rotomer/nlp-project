On October 14, 2011, Frontier Communications Corporation (the Company) entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, lead arranger and a lender, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto for a $575 million senior unsecured term loan facility with a final maturity of October 14, 2016.  Repayment of the outstanding principal balance will be made in quarterly installments in the amount of $14,375,000, commencing on March 31, 2012, with the remaining outstanding principal balance to be repaid on the final maturity date.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest based on the margins over the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or LIBOR, at the election of the Company.  Interest rate margins under the facility (ranging from 0.875% to 2.875% for Base Rate borrowings and 1.875% to 3.875% for LIBOR borrowings) are subject to adjustments based on the Total Leverage Ratio of the Company, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement.
 
The full amount of the facility was drawn on the closing date of the Credit Agreement.  The Company intends to use the proceeds to refinance a portion of its outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a restriction on the Companys ability to declare dividends if an event of default has occurred or will result therefrom, a financial covenant that requires compliance with a leverage ratio, and customary events of default.  Upon proper notice, the Company may, in whole or in part, repay the facility without premium or penalty, but subject to breakage fees on LIBOR loans, if applicable.  Amounts pre-paid may not be re-borrowed.
 
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Report and incorporated herein by reference.
