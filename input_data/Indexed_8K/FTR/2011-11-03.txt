After excluding $67.4 million for acquisition and integration costs, $3.6 million for severance and early retirement costs and $14.0 million for the reversal of uncertain tax positions, net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier for the third quarter of 2011 would have been $50.2 million, or $0.05 per share.
Stamford, CT, November 3, 2011
Frontiers third quarter showed the strongest level of broadband growth since we closed on our acquisition last year, said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman & CEO of Frontier Communications.  In total, weve brought broadband to 592,000 new homes while removing $496 million of annualized costs.  We also recently completed our largest successful conversion of the acquired property operating systems onto Frontiers legacy platform, which will further enhance our marketing, streamline our operations and increase our cost saving opportunities.  Frontier is committed to profitable expansion of broadband to our mostly rural communities, and were focused on enhancing revenues to protect our stable dividend.
for the third quarter of 2011 was $1,290.9 million as compared to $1,322.3 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $1,403.0 million in the third quarter of 2010.  The decrease in revenue for the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2010 is attributable to decreases in the number of residential and business customers, switched access, video and directory revenue.
Revenue
At September 30, 2011, the Company had 3,174,900 and 319,400 . The Company grew its by 16,200during the third quarter of 2011, which includes a net loss of 3,100 FiOS data customers. The Company had 1,754,800 high-speed internet customers at September 30, 2011.

for the third quarter of 2011 were $691.3 million as compared to $704.7 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $750.5 million in the third quarter of 2010.  Other operating expenses included severance and early retirement costs of $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, $11.0 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $6.9 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Network access expenses and other operating expenses
for the third quarter of 2011 was $351.9 million as compared to $359.0 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $339.9 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Depreciation and amortization
of approximately $67.4 million ($0.04 per share after tax) were incurred and expensed during the third quarter of 2011, as compared to approximately $20.3 million ($0.01 per share after tax) in the second quarter of 2011 and $78.5 million ($0.05 per share after tax) in the third quarter of 2010, in connection with our acquisition of the acquired properties. The costs in the third quarter of 2011 were incurred in connection with our recent successful conversion of various states onto our platform of system applications and other ongoing network integration work.
Acquisition and integration costs
for the third quarter of 2011 was $180.3 million and operating income margin was 14.0 percent as compared to operating income of $238.3 million and operating income margin of 18.0 percent in the second quarter of 2011 and operating income of $234.0 million and operating income margin of 16.7 percent in the third quarter of 2010. After excluding $67.4 million and $100.9 million for acquisition and integration costs, and $3.6 million and $14.6 million for severance and early retirement costs, operating income and operating income margin for the three months ended September 30, 2011 would have been $251.3 million and 19.5 percent, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 would have been $784.7 million and 19.8 percent, respectively.  After excluding acquisition and integration costs and severance and early retirement costs for the comparable periods of 2010, operating income and operating income margin for the three months ended September 30, 2010 would have been $319.5 million and 22.8 percent, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 would have been $665.8 million and 27.3 percent, respectively.
Operating income
for the third quarter of 2011 was $165.8 million as compared to $166.6 million in the third quarter of 2010, a $0.9 million decrease.
Interest expense
for the third quarter of 2011 was a $(6.9) million benefit as compared to a $40.4 million expense in the third quarter of 2010, a $47.3 million decrease.  Income taxes for the third quarter of 2011 reflect lower taxable income and the reversal of uncertain tax positions of $14.0 million.  In the third quarter of 2010, Frontier reduced certain deferred tax assets of approximately $12 million related to transaction costs (in connection with our acquisition of the acquired properties) which were not tax deductible.  Prior to the closing of the transaction, these costs were deemed to be tax deductible as the transaction had not yet been successfully completed.
Income tax expense
was $20.4 million, or $0.02 per share, as compared to $29.0 million, or $0.03 per share, in the third quarter of 2010.  The third quarter of 2011 includes acquisition and integration costs of $67.4 million and severance and early retirement costs of $3.6 million (combined impact of $43.8 million or $0.04 per share after tax).  The third quarter 2011 decrease is primarily the result of reduced operating income, partially offset by the benefit of lower income taxes, as discussed above.
Net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier
were $266.2 million for the third quarter of 2011 and $699.2 million for the first nine months of 2011, including $43.7 million for the third quarter of 2011 and $62.6 million for the first nine months of 2011 related to integration activities.
Capital expenditures
, as adjusted and defined by the Company in the attached Schedule B, was $609.2 million for the third quarter of 2011 resulting in an operating cash flow margin of 47.2 percent.  Operating cash flow, as reported, of $532.2 million has been adjusted to exclude $67.4 million of acquisition and integration costs, $6.0 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and $3.6 million of severance and early retirement costs for the third quarter of 2011.

, as defined by the Company in the attached Schedule A,was $263.9 million for the third quarter of 2011 and $748.1 million for the first nine months of 2011.  The Companys dividend represents a payout of 71 percent of free cash flow for the third quarter of 2011 and 75 percent of free cash flow for the first nine months of 2011.
Free cash flow
 
On October 14, 2011, the Company completed a bank financing for a $575 million senior unsecured amortizing term loan maturing October 14, 2016.  Proceeds were used to repay in full the remaining outstanding principal on three debt facilities (Frontiers $200 million Rural Telephone Financing Cooperative term loan maturing October 24, 2011, its $143 million CoBank term loan maturing December 31, 2012, and its $130 million CoBank term loan maturing December 31, 2013) and the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
This financing substantially satisfies maturities through 2012 and enables the Company to retain strong liquidity through its existing, undrawn $750 million revolving credit facility.
Pro Forma Information
As a convenience to investors, the Company furnished today on a Current Report on Form 8-K unaudited pro forma combined historical financial and operating data for the Company, including financial and operating data for the acquired properties, updated to reflect the actual financial and operating data for the third quarter of 2011.
The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow and operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Companys core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.  In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments.  The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude: $67.4 million, $20.3 million and $78.5 million of acquisition and integration costs in the quarters ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively, and $100.9 million and $125.9 million of acquisition and integration costs in the first nine months of 2011 and 2010, respectively; $6.0 million, $5.3 million and $12.1 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the quarters ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively, and $22.5 million and $24.2 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the first nine months of 2011 and 2010, respectively; and $3.6 million, $11.0 million and $6.9 million of severance and early retirement costs in the quarters ended September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively, and $14.6 million and $7.7 million of severance and early retirement costs in the first nine months of 2011 and 2010, respectively, because investors have indicated to management that such adjustments are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Companys underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Companys ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings.  In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure.  Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure.  Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.  The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
