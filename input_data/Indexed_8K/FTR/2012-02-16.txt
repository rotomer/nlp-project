 Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: FTR) today reported fourth-quarter 2011 revenue of $1,283.2 million, operating income of $230.5 million and net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier of $42.2 million, or $0.04 per share. After excluding $42.2 million for integration costs and $1.1 million for severance and early retirement costs, net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier for the fourth quarter of 2011 would have been $69.0 million, or $0.07 per share.
Stamford, Conn., February 16, 2012
 
Fourth quarter 2011 demonstrated the strongest quarterly revenue and EBITDA margin performance since our Verizon acquisition said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman  & CEO of Frontier Communications.  We also finished a successful 4 state conversion, started the prep work for the additional 9 states to convert in March 2012, and delivered annualized synergies of $552 million enabling us to increase our guidance for 2012 to $650 million.
Mrs. Wilderotter added:  Frontiers Board of Directors also made the decision to lower the quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share.  This will enable Frontier to reduce debt, improve our leverage, have ample cash to invest in the network and other strategic initiatives, and to provide a more sustainable shareholder return through a lower dividend payout ratio.  This was a difficult decision, but we believe it is in the best interest of all stakeholders and will make Frontier a competitively stronger business in both the near term and long term.
for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $1,283.2 million as compared to $1,290.9 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $1,358.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The decrease in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 is attributable to decreases in the number of residential and business customers, switched access, subsidy, video and other revenue.
Revenue
At December 31, 2011, the Company had 3,103,800 and 309,900 . The Company grew its by 9,300during the fourth quarter of 2011. The Company had 1,764,200 high-speed internet customers at December 31, 2011. The Company had net additions of 1,000 during the fourth quarter of 2011, which includes 6,900 net additions of satellite TV customers and a net loss of 5,900 FiOS video customers.  The Company had 557,500 video customers at December 31, 2011.

Other operating expenses included severance and early retirement costs of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.

for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $341.0 million as compared to $351.9 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $352.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Depreciation and amortization
of approximately $42.2 million ($0.03 per share after tax) were incurred during the fourth quarter of 2011, as compared to approximately $67.4 million ($0.04 per share after tax) in the third quarter of 2011 and $11.3 million ($0.01 per share after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2010, in connection with our integration of the acquired properties. These nonrecurring costs in 2011 were incurred in connection with our successful conversion of various states onto our platform of system applications on October 1, 2011, continued work on the conversion of remaining systems scheduled to commence in March 2012, and other ongoing network integration work.
Integration costs
for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $230.5 million and operating income margin was 18.0 percent as compared to operating income of $180.3 million and operating income margin of 14.0 percent in the third quarter of 2011 and operating income of $239.7 million and operating income margin of 17.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. After excluding $42.2 million for integration costs and $1.1 million for severance and early retirement costs, operating income and operating income margin for the three months ended December 31, 2011 would have been $273.8 million and 21.3 percent, respectively.  After excluding $143.1 million for integration costs and $15.7 million for severance and early retirement costs, operating income and operating income margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been $1,058.5 million and 20.2 percent, respectively.  After excluding acquisition and integration costs and severance and early retirement costs for the comparable periods of 2010, operating income and operating income margin for the three months ended December 31, 2010 would have been $253.7 million and 18.7 percent, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been $919.5 million and 24.2 percent, respectively.
Operating income
for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $165.2 million as compared to $167.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, a $2.3 million decrease.

Income tax expense
was $42.2 million, or $0.04 per share, as compared to $46.0 million, or $0.05 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The fourth quarter of 2011 includes integration costs of $42.2 million and severance and early retirement costs of $1.1 million (combined impact of $26.8 million or $0.03 per share after tax).  The fourth quarter 2011 decrease is primarily the result of reduced operating income, partially offset by lower income taxes.

Supplemental Information
As a convenience to investors, the Company furnished today on a Current Report on Form 8-K unaudited historical financial and operating data for the Company, including certain financial and operating data for the acquired properties, updated to reflect the actual financial and operating data for the fourth quarter of 2011.
The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include free cash flow and operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of the differences between free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Companys core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.  In addition, the Company believes that free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments.  The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude: $42.2 million, $67.4 million and $11.3 million of acquisition and integration costs in the quarters ended December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and $143.1 million and $137.1 million of acquisition and integration costs in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively; $1.4 million, $6.0 million and $15.8 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the quarters ended December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and $23.9 million and $40.1 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively; and $1.1 million, $3.6 million and $2.7 million of severance and early retirement costs in the quarters ended December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and $15.7 million and $10.4 million of severance and early retirement costs in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, because investors have indicated to management that such adjustments are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Companys underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Companys ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures.

These non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings.  In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure.  Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure.  Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.  The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
