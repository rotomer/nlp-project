Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier would be $75.3 million, or $0.08 per share.
Stamford, Conn., July 31, 2012
Frontiers second quarter 2012 showed solid revenue performance and the highest operating margin since the closing of our acquisition, said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman & CEO of Frontier Communications.  Our strong results were positively impacted by our proactive revenue initiatives commenced in the second quarter to rationalize our product set and our customer pricing. Our new, residential tiered pricing gives customers flexibility and choice, which should enhance the run-rate of our financials for the second half of 2012.  During the quarter, we expanded our networks broadband reach to an additional 60,000 households and are aggressively focused on increasing our overall network speeds over the next eighteen months. Frontier is also excited to be connecting 92,876 additional broadband homes through our $71.9 million receipt of the Federal Communications Commissions Connect America Fund, which is aligned with our corporate goal of improved broadband connectivity for rural America and we will connect even more broadband households starting in Q4 2012 through our recent agreement with Hughes Network Systems.
was $18.0 million, or $0.02 per share, in the second quarter of 2012, as compared to $32.3 million, or $0.03 per share, in the second quarter of 2011.  The second quarter of 2012 includes a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $70.8 million, integration costs of $28.6 million and severance and early retirement costs of $1.5 million, partially offset by an investment gain of $9.8 million (combined impact of $57.3 million or $0.06 per share after tax).  Excluding the impact of the aforementioned items, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier for the second quarter of 2012 would be $75.3 million, or $0.08 per share.

for the second quarter of 2012 was $1,258.8 million as compared to $1,268.1 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $1,322.3 million in the second quarter of 2011.  The decrease in revenue for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the second quarter of 2011 is attributable to decreases in the number of residential and business customers, switched access, data services and video revenue.
Revenue
At June 30, 2012, the Company had 2,978,900 and 296,500 . The Companys additions were 5,400 during the second quarter of 2012, reflecting an expected increase in conversion non-pay disconnects and less robust marketing promotions.  The Company had 1,781,300 broadband customers at June 30, 2012. The Company had net additions of 6,300 during the second quarter of 2012, which includes 13,300 net additions of satellite TV customers and a net loss of 7,000 FiOS video customers.  The Company had 568,200 video customers at June 30, 2012.

for the second quarter of 2012 were $655.3 million as compared to $667.2 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $704.7 million in the second quarter of 2011.  Other operating expenses included severance and early retirement costs of $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2012, $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $11.0 million in the second quarter of 2011.
Network access expenses and other operating expenses
for the second quarter of 2012 was $307.0 million as compared to $357.3 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $359.0 million in the second quarter of 2011. Amortization expense decreased by $48.4 million in the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the accelerated write-off of software licenses during the first quarter of 2012 as a result of the completed systems conversions.
Depreciation and amortization
of approximately $28.6 million ($0.02 per share after tax) were incurred during the second quarter of 2012, as compared to approximately $35.1 million ($0.02 per share after tax) in the first quarter of 2012 and $20.3 million ($0.01 per share after tax) in the second quarter of 2011, in connection with our integration of the acquired properties. These nonrecurring costs in 2012 were incurred in connection with our successful conversion of the final nine states onto our platform of system applications in March 2012, and other ongoing network integration work.  Our integration costs and related capital expenditures will be completed by the end of 2012.
Integration costs
for the second quarter of 2012 was $267.8 million (reflecting lower depreciation and amortization, integration costs, network access expenses and other operating expenses as compared to the first quarter of 2012) and operating income margin was 21.3 percent as compared to operating income of $208.5 million and operating income margin of 16.4 percent in the first quarter of 2012 and operating income of $238.3 million and operating income margin of 18.0 percent in the second quarter of 2011.
Operating income
Excluding integration costs and severance and early retirement costs, operating income and operating income margin for the three months ended June 30, 2012 would have been $297.9 million and 23.7 percent, respectively.  Excluding the comparable adjustments in each period, operating income and operating income margin for the three months ended March 31, 2012 would have been $250.1 million and 19.7 percent, respectively, and for the three months ended June 30, 2011 would have been $269.5 million and 20.4 percent, respectively.
for the second quarter of 2012 reflects losses of $70.8 million ($0.04 per share after tax) recognized on the early extinguishment of debt.  In May 2012, the Company completed a registered offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.250% senior unsecured notes due 2021.  We received net proceeds of approximately $490.6 million from the offering which we used, along with cash on hand, to retire debt through a cash tender offer during the second quarter of 2012.  We retired early $400.0 million of the Companys debt maturing in 2014 which had an effective interest cost of 10.855%, reflecting the fact that such notes were issued at a discount in April 2009.

for the second quarter of 2012 was $172.1 million as compared to $166.9 million in the second quarter of 2011, a $5.2 million increase, primarily due to lower capitalized interest in 2012.
Interest expense
for the second quarter of 2012 was $11.7 million as compared to $37.2 million in the second quarter of 2011, a $25.5 million decrease, due to lower pretax income and the comparable prior year period included a $10.5 million charge resulting from the enactment on May 25, 2011 of the Michigan Corporate Income Tax which eliminated certain future tax deductions.
Income tax expense
for Frontier business operations were $167.6 million for the second quarter of 2012 and $376.1 million for the first six months of 2012.  Capital expenditures related to integration activities were $12.2 million for the second quarter of 2012 and $27.9 million for the first six months of 2012.
Capital expenditures
, as adjusted and defined by the Company in the attached Schedule B, was $620.4 million for the second quarter of 2012 resulting in an operating cash flow margin of 49.3 percent.  Operating cash flow, as reported, of $574.8 million has been adjusted to exclude $28.6 million of integration costs, $15.5 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs, and $1.5 million of severance and early retirement costs for the second quarter of 2012.
Operating cash flow
, as defined by the Company in the attached Schedule A,was $284.9 million for the second quarter of 2012 and $538.0 million for the first six months of 2012.  The Companys dividend represents a payout of 37 percent of free cash flow for the first six months of 2012.
Free cash flow
 
Working Capital
At June 30, 2012, we had a working capital deficiency of $240.8 million, which includes the classification of certain debt maturing in the first quarter of 2013 of $522.7 million as a current liability.  We had a working capital surplus of $281.9 million at June 30, 2012, after excluding the debt classification.  We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash balances and existing revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our working capital and other cash requirements.
2012 Guidance
For the full year of 2012, the Companys expectations for and , excluding integration costs and integration capital expenditures, are unchanged and within a range of $725 million to $775 million and $900 million to $1 billion, respectively.  We expect that in 2012 our will be approximately $25 million. We expect to incur operating expenses and capital expenditures for integration activities of approximately $80 million and $40 million, respectively, in 2012.  We expect to make net contributions to our pension plan of approximately $30 million to $40 million in 2012, which reflects the positive impact of funding rate changes contained in the Highway Investment Act of 2012.

Non-GAAP Measures
The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier, free cash flow and operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of the differences between non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier, free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are not alternatives to operating income or net income reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Companys core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.  In addition, the Company believes that non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier, free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier in the statement of operations, or cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments.  The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude: $70.8 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2012, with no comparable amounts in the other periods presented;  $9.8 million of investment gains for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2012, with no comparable amounts in the other periods presented; $10.5 million of discrete tax items for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011, with no comparable amounts in the other periods presented; $28.6 million, $35.1 million and $20.3 million of integration costs in the quarters ended June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2011, respectively, and $63.7 million and $33.5 million of integration costs in the first six months of 2012 and 2011, respectively; $1.5 million, $6.5 million and $11.0 million of severance and early retirement costs in the quarters ended June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2011, respectively, and $8.0 million and $11.0 million of severance and early retirement costs in the first six months of 2012 and 2011, respectively; and in free cash flow and operating cash flow, $15.5 million, $12.4 million and $5.3 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the quarters ended June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2011, respectively, and $27.9 million and $16.6 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the first six months of 2012 and 2011, respectively, because investors have indicated to management that such adjustments are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Companys underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Companys ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings.  In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure.  Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure.  Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.  The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
