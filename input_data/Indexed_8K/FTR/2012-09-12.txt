As disclosed in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 14, 2010 (the September 14, 2010 8-K), Frontier Communications Corporation (the Company) agreed to obtain a letter of credit to satisfy certain of its capital investment commitments in West Virginia in connection with its July 1, 2010 acquisition of wireline operations from Verizon Communications.  In furtherance of this agreement, on September 8, 2010, the Company entered into an unsecured letter of credit facility, the terms of which were set forth in a Credit Agreement, dated as of September 8, 2010, among the Company, the Lenders party thereto, and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch (the Bank), as Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank (the Credit Agreement).  The Credit Agreement was filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the September 14, 2010 8-K.  An initial letter of credit for $190 million was issued under the Credit Agreement and expired on September 20, 2011.  Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Bank exercised its option to extend up to $100 million of the commitments to September 20, 2012.
 
On September 11, 2012, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment) to extend $40 million of the commitments to September 20, 2013.  Two letters of credit, one for $20 million expiring March 2013 and the other for $20 million expiring September 2013, are expected to be issued shortly.
 
The declining amounts of the letters of credit since September 2010 reflect the Companys spending against its capital investment commitments in West Virginia. 
 
The Company is required to pay an annual facility fee on the available commitment, regardless of usage.  The covenants binding on the Company under the terms of the Amendment are substantially similar to those in the Companys other credit facilities, including limitations on liens, substantial asset sales and mergers, subject to customary exceptions and thresholds.
 
This description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.
