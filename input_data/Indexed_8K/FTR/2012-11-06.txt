Exhibit 99.1
 Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: FTR) today reported third quarter 2012 revenue of $1,252.5 million, operating income of $275.2 million and net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier of $67.0 million, or $0.07 per share.
Stamford, Conn., November 6, 2012
Frontier had a milestone third quarter, with the best revenue and customer metrics since the closing of our July 2010 acquisition.  Our improved broadband speeds, new simple and flexible pricing, and great customer service are positively impacting the customer experience, said Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman & CEO of Frontier Communications.  Our strong results enabled us to raise $850 million in the bond market during August and October, bringing our 2012 total to $1.35 billion.  We are well on track to meet our federal and state broadband expansion commitments, and we are excited about our new fourth quarter promotions and offers, including bundled satellite broadband service with Hughes, bundled mobile service with AT&T, and an Apple gift card promotion.
 
for the third quarter of 2012 was $1,252.5 million as compared to $1,258.8 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $1,290.9 million in the third quarter of 2011.  The decrease in revenue for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2011 is attributable to decreases in the number of residential and business customers and switched access revenue.
Revenue
 
The Company's results reflect improvements in a number of critical .  At September 30, 2012, the Company had 2,932,200 and 291,400 .  During the three months ended September 30, 2012 we lost approximately 51,800 customers as compared to 65,700 customers in the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 72,600 customers in the three months ended March 31, 2012.  Also, during the most recent quarter, the average monthly customer revenue per customer increased $2.09, or 1.9%, over the second quarter of 2012 and $3.61, or 3.3%, over the first quarter of 2012.

The Companys net additions were approximately 1,000 during the third quarter of 2012, reflecting the impact of lower customer activations as a result of fewer marketing promotions and final conversion clean-up.  The Company had 1,782,300 broadband customers at September 30, 2012.  The Company added 27,300 satellite TV customers and lost 4,100 FiOS video customers during the third quarter of 2012.  The Company had 388,300 at September 30, 2012, which reflects the curtailment of DirecTV billing as part of its bundled packages.

for the third quarter of 2012 were $674.4 million as compared to $655.3 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $691.3 million in the third quarter of 2011.  Other operating expenses included severance costs of $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2012, $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2011. The Company incurred non-recurring storm cost expenses in the third quarter of 2012 of approximately $15 million as compared to the second quarter of 2012.

for the third quarter of 2012 was $298.4 million as compared to $307.0 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $351.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Amortization expense decreased by $36.7 million in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to the write-off of certain software licenses no longer required for operations and the amortization associated with certain Frontier legacy properties that were fully amortized in March 2012.
Depreciation and amortization
of approximately $4.5 million were incurred during the third quarter of 2012, as compared to approximately $28.6 million ($0.02 per share after tax) in the second quarter of 2012 and $67.4 million ($0.04 per share after tax) in the third quarter of 2011, in connection with our integration of the acquired properties. These nonrecurring costs in 2012 were incurred in connection with our successful conversion of the final nine states onto our platform of system applications in March 2012, and other ongoing network and operations integration work.  Our integration costs and related capital expenditures will be completed by the end of 2012.
Integration costs
for the third quarter of 2012 was $275.2 million (reflecting lower depreciation and amortization, integration costs and network access expenses as compared to the third quarter of 2011) and operating income margin was 22.0 percent as compared to operating income of $267.8 million and operating income margin of 21.3 percent in the second quarter of 2012 and operating income of $180.3 million and operating income margin of 14.0 percent in the third quarter of 2011.
Operating income
Excluding integration costs and severance costs, operating income and operating income margin for the three months ended September 30, 2012 would have been $286.5 million and 22.9 percent, respectively.  Excluding the comparable adjustments in each period, operating income and operating income margin for the three months ended June 30, 2012 would have been $297.9 million and 23.7 percent, respectively, and for the three months ended September 30, 2011 would have been $251.3 million and 19.5 percent, respectively.  Operating income, excluding integration costs and severance costs, decreased $11.4 million in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to the non-recurring storm cost expenses.
for the third quarter of 2012 was $172.2 million as compared to $165.8 million in the third quarter of 2011, a $6.4 million increase, primarily due to higher average debt levels and lower capitalized interest in 2012.  In August 2012, the Company completed a registered offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior unsecured notes due 2023.  We received net proceeds of approximately $588.1 million from the offering which we will use to repurchase or retire existing indebtedness or for general corporate purposes.
Interest expense
for the third quarter of 2012 was $35.7 million as compared to a $6.9 million tax benefit in the third quarter of 2011, a $42.6 million increase, principally due to higher pretax income and the reduced impact for the reversal of uncertain tax positions of $6.2 million.
Income tax expense
was $67.0 million, or $0.07 per share, in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to $20.4 million, or $0.02 per share, in the third quarter of 2011.  The third quarter of 2012 includes severance costs of $6.8 million, integration costs of $4.5 million and losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million, offset by the reversal of uncertain tax positions of $7.8 million (combined net impact of $0.2 million after tax).  Excluding the impact of the aforementioned items, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier for the third quarter of 2012 would be $66.8 million, or $0.07 per share.

Capital expenditures
, as adjusted and defined by the Company in the attached Schedule B, was $581.3 million for the third quarter of 2012 resulting in an operating cash flow margin of 46.4 percent.  Operating cash flow, as reported, of $573.6 million for the third quarter of 2012 has been adjusted to exclude $6.8 million of severance costs and $4.5 million of integration costs, partially offset by $3.6 million of non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs.
Operating cash flow
, as defined by the Company in the attached Schedule A,was $215.3 million for the third quarter of 2012 and $753.3 million for the first nine months of 2012.  The Companys dividend represents a payout of 40 percent of free cash flow for the first nine months of 2012.
Free cash flow
 
Working Capital
At September 30, 2012, we had a working capital surplus of $608.2 million, which includes the classification of certain debt maturing in the first quarter of 2013 of $502.7 million as a current liability.  We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash balances and existing revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our working capital and other cash requirements.
Fourth Quarter Debt Offering and Repurchases
On October 1, 2012, the Company completed a registered debt offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior unsecured notes due 2023, issued at a price of 104.250% of their principal amount, equating to an effective yield of 6.551%.  The notes are an additional issuance to the $600 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2023 issued by the Company on August 15, 2012.   The Company will use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repurchase or retire its existing indebtedness or for general corporate purposes.
On October 1, 2012, the Company accepted for purchase $75.7 million and $59.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% Senior Notes due 2015 (the April 2015 Notes) and its 8.250% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes), respectively, in open market repurchases for total consideration of $154.7 million.  The repurchases resulted in a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $19.3 million ($0.01 per share after tax) to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012.  As of October 31, 2012, approximately $374.8 million aggregate principal amount of the April 2015 Notes and $1,040.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes remained outstanding.
Guidance
For the full year of 2012, the Companys expectations for and , excluding integration costs and integration capital expenditures, are within a range of $750 million to $775 million and $900 million to $1 billion, respectively. We expect that in 2012 our will be approximately $15 million. We expect to incur operating expenses and capital expenditures for integration activities of approximately $80 million and $50 million, respectively, in 2012.  We made total net contributions to our pension plan for 2012 of $28.5 million, including $18.2 million in the third quarter of 2012 and $10.3 million in October 2012.   These contributions reflect the positive impact of funding rate changes contained in the Highway Investment Act of 2012.  There are no further contributions to be made in 2012.

Non-GAAP Measures
The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its performance. These include non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier, free cash flow and operating cash flow.  A reconciliation of the differences between non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier, free cash flow and operating cash flow and the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is included in the tables that follow. The non-GAAP financial measures are by definition not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are not alternatives to operating income or net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier as reflected in the statement of operations or to cash flow as reflected in the statement of cash flows and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and results of operations because these measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) together provide a more comprehensive view of the Companys core operations and ability to generate cash flow, (ii) provide investors with the financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents measurements that investors and rating agencies have indicated to management are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.  In addition, the Company believes that non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier, free cash flow and operating cash flow, as the Company defines them, can assist in comparing performance from period to period, without taking into account factors affecting operating income or net income attributable to common shareholders of Frontier in the statement of operations, or cash flow reflected in the statement of cash flows, including changes in working capital and the timing of purchases and payments. The Company has shown adjustments to its financial presentations to exclude losses on the early extinguishment of debt, investment gains, tax benefits for the reversal of uncertain tax positions, discrete tax items, integration costs, severance costs and non-cash pension and other postretirement benefit costs, as disclosed in the attached Schedules A, B and C, because investors have indicated to management that such adjustments are useful to them in assessing the Company and its results of operations.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to (i) assist in analyzing the Companys underlying financial performance from period to period, (ii) evaluate the financial performance of its business units, (iii) analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions, (iv) establish criteria for compensation decisions, and (v) assist management in understanding the Companys ability to generate cash flow and, as a result, to plan for future capital and operational decisions.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures have certain shortcomings.  In particular, free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since items such as debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining such measure.  Operating cash flow has similar shortcomings as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures, debt repayments and dividends are not deducted in determining this measure.  Management compensates for the shortcomings of these measures by utilizing them in conjunction with their comparable GAAP financial measures.  The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in our documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
