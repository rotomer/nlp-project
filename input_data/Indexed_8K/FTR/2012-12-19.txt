STAMFORD, Conn., December 19, 2012 -
Frontiers Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Maggie Wilderotter said, We announce Dons resignation with regret.  He has been a major contributor to our company during pivotal times.  In addition to helping spearhead major acquisitions and system conversions, he did a great job managing our balance sheet and interfacing with all of our shareholders.  Mrs. Wilderotter recognized Mr. Shassians overall leadership and his contributions to Frontier during his nearly seven-year tenure.
Mrs. Wilderotter added, "On behalf of everyone at Frontier, we wish Don and his family the best in their future endeavors.  We appreciate all he has done for Frontier during a time that included company-wide transformation.  We tripled in size in 2010, and thanks to Dons astute oversight we completed key system conversions almost a year ahead of schedule, resulting in increased synergies savings and improved processes.  Mr. Shassian will leave Frontier with the integration of the Verizon acquisition complete, including $650 million of realized synergies.
Mr. Shassian stated, "I am glad to have had the opportunity to work with Maggie and the team at Frontier.  My decision to resign allows me to explore the next chapter in my career now that the transition of all our systems to the Frontier platform is complete.  I am very pleased about what we have accomplished at Frontier as a team and very proud of my contributions to its overall growth into a FORTUNE 500 company.  I wish everyone at Frontier success and look forward to helping John in the transition of responsibilities."
