Distribution Operations
The increase in EBIT of $11.3 million for calendar 2002 as compared to calendar 2001 was due to changes in the following:
decreases in operating margin of $2.9 million due to:
increases in AGLC's PRP rider revenues of $9.1 million which includes a $2.7 million adjustment for recovery of prior
year program expenses; this program recovers operating and capital program expenditures incurred in prior periods, and future revenues expected to be received in the next 12 months are reflected as unrecovered  pipeline replacement costs on the balance sheet
increases in VNG's operating margin of $1.1 million due to customer growth and the effect of a two year experimental
WNA program that went into effect for the billing cycle beginning November 2002
increases in CGC's operating margin of $0.6 million due to increased customer count
the PBR settlement with the GPSC, which decreased AGLC's margin for calendar 2002 by $6.7 million
a one-time adjustment that reduced cost of sales by $3.7 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2001 related to inventory costs for natural gas stored underground
a decrease of $3.3 million resulting from a decline in AGLC customers which is primarily a result of customers who do not have the ability to pay Marketers and the statutory right of customers to disconnect on a seasonal basis without penalty
decreases in operating expenses of $13.6 million
decreases in payroll and benefits expenses of $3.8 million as a result of continued efficiencies in the distribution operations segment, the impact of a change in the postretirement health care plan and the transition of VNG employees to AGL Resources' benefit plans
decreases in bad debt expenses of $4.7 million primarily due to higher-than-normal bad debt in calendar 2001 as a result of colder-than-normal weather and higher-than-normal gas prices
reduction in goodwill amortization of $3.6 million as a result of the adoption of SFAS 142
decreases in depreciation expense of $2.3 million due to a $5.6 million decline in average depreciation rates from 3.0% to 2.6% as a result of AGLC's PBR settlement offset by an increase in depreciation expenses of $3.3 million due to property, plant & equipment additions
all other increases of $0.8 million due primarily to increased property tax assessments
an increase in other income of $0.6 million from carrying charges on higher average balances of natural gas stored underground on behalf of AGLC's Marketers
The increase in EBIT of $40.8 million for calendar 2001 as compared to calendar 2000 was due to:
increases in operating margin of $71.9 million primarily due to the acquisition of VNG effective October 2000 resulting in additional operating margin of $64.8 million, $6.5 million of additional PRP revenues at AGLC and $3.7 million in additional margin due to a one-time adjustment in 2001 to reduce inventory costs for natural gas stored underground offset by a decrease in operating margin of $2.5 million at CGC due to lower customer volumes in 2001 resulting from colder weather in 2000
increases in operating expenses of $34.2 million primarily due to the acquisition of VNG
increases in other income of $3.1 million due to an increase in carrying charges related to gas stored underground on behalf AGLC's marketers.
 
Wholesale Services
The following table reflects the adoption of EITF 02-03, which requires energy-trading entities to present gains and losses from energy marketing activities on a net basis. Wholesale services was established during calendar 2001 and had no results in calendar 2000.
The increase in EBIT of $2.6 million for calendar 2002 as compared to calendar 2001 was due to:
increases in operating margin of $5.2 million, primarily as a result of increased weather volatility from warmer-than-normal weather in the Northeast, two hurricanes in late summer, colder weather in November and December 2002, and an overall increase in volumes sold. These weather related events caused interruption in the supply/demand equilibrium between the affected production and market areas resulting in wide locational pricing disparities. Sequent used access to contracted assets and its expertise in logistics to maximize the profit opportunity by flowing gas on the most economical path available.
increases in other income of $2.2 million primarily due to a prior-year write-off of the investment in Etowah LNG of $2.6 million resulting from a termination of the joint venture partnership which was formed in fiscal 1998, offset by $0.4 million of other income
increase in operating expenses of $4.8 million primarily attributable to the addition of personnel to support the growth of the wholesale services business and the effects of a full year of operating expenses.
The increase in EBIT of $6.5 million for calendar 2001 as compared to calendar 2000 was due to the formation of Sequent in calendar 2001.
Energy Investments
The increase in EBIT of $5.3 million for calendar 2002 as compared to calendar 2001 was primarily due to the following:
an increase of $6.4 million in other income due to:
equity earnings from Southstar increased by $13.5 million due to lower wholesale costs and the increase in the credit quality of retail customers
the receipt of a $2.0 million contract renewal payment associated with the terms of the sale of Utilipro
US Propane's joint venture income increased by $1.6 million
a $10.9 million decrease due to a pre-tax gain from the sale of Utilipro that  was recorded in calendar 2001
A decrease in AGL Networks EBIT of  $1.1 million which reflects increased contract revenues offset by  increased operating expenses due to the addition of personnel to support AGL Network's growth
The decrease in EBIT of $1.0 million for calendar 2001 as compared to calendar 2000 was primarily due to the following:
Contribution from SouthStar increased $3.6 million, due to an increase in the number of customers served as compared with the same period last year.
$16.3 million increase in EBIT related to Utilipro due to the sale of Utilipro in March 2001 resulting in a pre-tax gain of $10.9 million. In addition, since Utilipro was no longer owned after March 2001, both operating margin and operating expenses related to Utilipro decreased by $12.8 million and $18.1 million, respectively, for a net increase of $5.3 million.
A decrease in contribution from propane operations  of $16.7 million which includes:
a pre-tax gain of $13.1 million recorded in connection with a series of transactions involving AGL Resources' propane operations in 2000
increases in 2001 EBIT due to 2000 EBIT losses of $0.6 million from AGL Resources' former wholly-owned propane operations
decrease in US Propane's contribution of $4.2 million from AGL Resources' joint venture primarily due to a true-up in 2001 related to estimated 2000 contributions due to the formation of US Propane in August 2000
Increase in AGL Networks operating expenses of $2.4 million as result of the formation of AGL Networks in calendar 2000
Corporate
The decrease in EBIT of $10.2 million for calendar 2002 as compared to calendar 2001 was primarily due to the establishment of reserves related to an anticipated settlement of a technology contract. employee severance costs and the write-off of capital costs related to a terminated management software implementation project.  These decreases were offset by the release of expenses related to the settlement of regulatory matters during calendar 2002 and for unbilled revenue issues at SouthStar during calendar 2001.
The increase in EBIT of $5.6 million for calendar 2001 as compared to calendar 2000 is primarily due to the release of corporate reserves in 2001 which were established in 2000 and a decrease in other loss due to decreased corporate expenses offset by a decrease in operating margin from a subsidiary that became non-operating in 2001.
