Sequent Energy Management Risk Control
In order for Executive Management to effectively capture and monitor risks identified and quantitatively measured, a sound Risk Management framework is required
.
Organization & People
Well defined risk management organization structure
Methodologies
Consistent and approved valuation and risk measurement
methodologies
Limits & Controls
Appropriate risk limits to communicate the Company's risk appetite
Reporting
A comprehensive and consistent framework for communicating risk taking activities across the
organization
Policies
Comprehensive policies to communicate strategies, approved activities, risk tolerances, and control processes and procedures
Systems & Data
integrated systems and consistent and reliable data are
the backbone of an effective risk management program
Risk-Adjusted Performance Indicators
Value at Risk
VaR:
  Maximum expected variation in the portfolio's value within a given degree of confidence, over a specific holding period.  
VaR Details:
  95% confidence interval
  Sequent's VaR model is based on weighted historical price changes
The Sharpe Ratio is the difference between the return to an investment and a benchmark return, divided by the standard deviation of that difference.
Inputs to the Sharp Ratio:
  Operating Income:  Wholesale Services
  Average Monthly Capital Deployed:  Wholesale Services
  90-Day Treasury Bill Rates

Risk-Adjusted Performance Indicators
Summary of Results:
The Sharpe Ratio for Sequent Wholesale Services is 2.12 for the 2003 year- to-date period ending September 2003.
The decrease in the value is attributed primarily to lower profitability.
The decreasing trend of this ratio is expected to reverse as we move out of the shoulder/fall season and into the winter season when we usually see increased profitability.

Risk Adjusted Return On Capital (RAROC) - Wholesale Services
RAROC is a risk-adjusted performance measure.  The metric measures the profitability of a firm based on economic capital.

Forward-Looking Statements
These presentations contain forward-looking statements. Company management cautions readers that the assumptions, which form the basis for the forward-looking statements, include many factors that are beyond company management's ability to control or estimate precisely. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in industrial, commercial, and residential growth in the company's service territories and those of the company's subsidiaries; changes in price and demand for natural gas and related products; impact of changes in state and federal legislation and regulation, including various orders of the state public service commissions and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, on the gas and electric industries and on the company, including the impact of Atlanta Gas Light Company's performance based rate plan; effects and uncertainties of deregulation and competition, particularly in markets where prices and providers historically have been regulated, unknown risks related to nonregulated businesses, and unknown issues such as the stability of certificated marketers; impact of Georgia's Natural Gas Consumers' Relief Act of 2002; concentration of credit risk in certificated marketers and the company's wholesale services segment's counterparties; excess network capacity and demand/growth for dark fiber in metro network areas of AGL Networks' customers; AGL Networks' introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, as well as the adoption of new networking standards; ability of AGL Networks to produce sufficient capital to fund its business; ability to negotiate new contracts with telecommunications providers for the provision of AGL Networks' dark-fiber services; industry consolidation; performance of equity and bond markets and the impact on pension fund costs; impact of acquisitions and divestitures; changes in accounting policies and practices issued periodically by accounting standard-setting bodies; direct or indirect effects on the company's business, financial condition or liquidity resulting from a change in the company's credit ratings or the credit ratings of the company's competitors or counterparties; interest rate fluctuations, financial market conditions, and general economic conditions; uncertainties about environmental issues and the related impact of such issues; impact of changes in weather upon the temperature- sensitive portions of the company's business; and other risks described in the company's documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
