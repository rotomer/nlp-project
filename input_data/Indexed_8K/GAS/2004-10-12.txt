ATLANTA, October 12, 2004
- AGL Resources (NYSE: ATG) and NUI Corporation (NYSE: NUI) have reached an agreement in principle with Green Meadows Partners, LLP to settle litigation relating to a shareholder class action complaint filed September 2, 2004. The complaint was filed by Green Meadows Partners, LLP, on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, in a civil action against NUI Corporation, its board of directors, and AGL Resources Inc.
Although AGL Resources believes that the complaint is without merit, the Company also believes that litigation could delay and create uncertainty as to its ability to consummate its acquisition of NUI Corporation, and that such delay and uncertainty are not in the best interests of AGL Resources and its shareholders.
The settlement calls for NUI Corporation to provide certain additional information and disclosures to shareholders, as reflected in the "Additional Disclosure" section of NUI's proxy statement supplement, filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, as part of the settlement, NUI Corporation and AGL Resources will consent to a settlement class that consists of persons holding shares of NUI common stock at any time from July 15, 2004 until the date on which the acquisition is consummated, and AGL Resources will pay plaintiff's attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $285,000, with payment of such fees subject to final court approval of the settlement and such fees and costs, and consummation of the acquisition. No part of these attorney's fees or costs will be paid out of monies that would otherwise have been paid to NUI's shareholders.
The settlement is contingent upon final court approval and the consummation of the acquisition of NUI Corporation by AGL Resources.
