ITEM: Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
The undersigned registrant hereby amends Item 9.01(a) and 9.01(b) of its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 30, 2004 to include the financial statements of NUI Corporation, acquired by AGL Resources Inc. on November 30, 2004, and certain pro forma financial information. This amendment also includes item 2.03.
 
Item 2.03
 
 
Creation of Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
NUI Utilities, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of NUI had approximately $200 million of indebtedness pursuant to revenue bonds that are the obligation of NUI Utilities, Inc., a wholly owned utility subsidiary of NUI Corporation. We do not guarantee or provide any other form of security for the repayment of this indebtedness.
NUI Utilities is party to a series of loan agreements with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) pursuant to which the NJEDA has issued four series of gas facilities revenue bonds:
NUI Utilities is also party to a loan agreement pursuant to which Brevard County, Florida has issued $20 million principal amount of bonds at 6.40% due October 1, 2024.
In accordance with the terms of these loan agreements, the funds received by the NJEDA or Brevard County, as the case may be, upon the issuance of the applicable bonds have been loaned to NUI Utilities. The interest rates and maturity dates under the loan agreements parallel the interest rates and maturity dates under the bonds. Interest payments by NUI Utilities on the loans are used to pay the interest on the bonds.
The Variable Bonds contain a provision whereby the holder can "put" the bonds back to the issuer. In 1996, NUI Utilities executed a long-term Standby Bond Purchase Agreement (SBPA) with a syndicate of banks, which was amended and restated on June 12, 2001. Under the terms of the SBPA, as further amended, The Bank of New York (the bank) is obligated under certain circumstances to purchase Variable Bonds that are tendered by the holders thereof and not remarketed by the remarketing agent. Such obligation of the bank would remain in effect until the expiration of the SBPA, unless it is extended or earlier terminated.
The terms of the SBPA restrict the payment of dividends by NUI Utilities to an amount based, in part, on the earned surplus as defined in the agreement of NUI Utilities. On May 19, 2004, NUI Utilities and the bank amended the SBPA to eliminate the effect of NUI Utilities settlement with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities related to our acquisition of NUI and the estimated refunds to customers in Florida on the earned surplus of NUI Utilities. In addition the amendment extended the expiration date of the SBPA to June 29, 2005. For a summary of the terms of the settlement with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, see our Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 26, 2004.
If the SBPA is not further extended beyond June 29, 2005, in accordance with the terms of the Variable Bonds, all of the Variable Bonds would be subject to mandatory tender at a purchase price of 100 percent of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, to the date of tender. In such case, any Variable Bonds that are not remarketable by the remarketing agent will be purchased by The Bank of New York.
Beginning six months after the expiration or termination of the SBPA, any Variable Bonds still held by the bank must be redeemed or purchased by NUI Utilities in ten equal, semi-annual installments. In addition, while the SBPA is in effect, any tendered Variable Bonds that are purchased by the bank and not remarketed within one year must be redeemed or purchased by NUI Utilities at such time, and every six months thereafter, in ten equal, semi-annual installments.
As of November 30, 2004, the aggregate principal and accrued interest on the outstanding Variable Bonds totaled approximately $39.0 million. Principal and any unpaid interest on the outstanding Variable Bonds are due on June 1, 2026, unless the put option is exercised before that time.

Financial Statements
As of and for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2004
To the Shareholder of NUI Corporation:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and statement of capitalization and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NUI Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of AGL Resources Inc. as of November 30, 2004) and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at September 30, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements of AGL Resources Inc. (AGL) give effect to the acquisition of the outstanding common shares of NUI Corporation (NUI) by AGL on November 30, 2004. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not purport to represent what the results of operations or financial position of AGL would have been if the purchase transaction had occurred on the dates indicated below, nor do they purport to project the results of operations or financial position of AGL for any future period or as of any future date. The acquisition was partially funded by AGL through the issuance of its common stock, which was completed on November 24, 2004.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2004 was prepared by combining the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of AGL as of September 30, 2004 and the audited condensed consolidated balance sheet of NUI as of September 30, 2004, giving effect to the acquisition of NUI as though it had been completed on September 30, 2004.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was prepared by combining the AGL unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 with the NUI condensed consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 to give effect to the acquisition of NUI as though it had occurred on January 1, 2004. The NUI unaudited pro forma condensed statement of income for the nine months ending September 30, 2004 was prepared by deducting the NUI unaudited statement of income for the three months ended December 31, 2003 from the NUI audited statement of income for the year ended September 30, 2004.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was prepared by combining the AGL audited condensed consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the NUI unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003, giving effect to the acquisition of NUI as though it had been completed on January 1, 2003. The NUI unaudited pro forma condensed statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was prepared by deducting the NUI unaudited statement of income for the three months ended December 31, 2002 from the audited statement of income for the year ended September 30, 2003 and adding to that the NUI unaudited statement of income for the three months ended December 31, 2003.
The historical amounts of AGL as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 are summarized from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-Q filed by AGL on October 27, 2004 with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC). The historical amounts of AGL for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 are summarized from audited consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K filed by AGL on February 6, 2004 with the SEC. NUIs historical audited consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2004 and the audited condensed consolidated statement of income of NUI for the year ended September 30, 2004 are summarized from the NUI audited financial statements included in this filing as exhibit 99.1. The unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and three months ended December 31, 2002 of NUI were derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-Q filed by NUI on May 20, 2004 and December 31, 2002, respectively, with the SEC
You should read the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements along with AGLs and NUIs consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in AGLs and NUIs prior SEC filings.
 
The revaluation of NUIs identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is a preliminary valuation based upon currently available information and is subject to final adjustments. The valuation is considered preliminary since they are based upon limited information available to management and independent appraisers. Accordingly, the actual adjustments to be recorded in connection with the final purchase price allocation could differ from the pro forma adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, and any such differences could be material. Management anticipates finalizing the purchase price allocation within a year of the acquisition.
 
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred had the acquisition been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position. The preliminary purchase price allocation adjustments made in connection with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on a preliminary valuation and estimates that have been made solely for purposes of developing the pro forma financial information and are based upon currently available information. The preliminary valuation and estimates are subject to final adjustments. Accordingly, the actual adjustments to be recorded in connection with the final purchase price allocation will differ from the pro forma adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, and any such differences may be material.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price (including estimated transaction fees and expenses and preliminary valuation adjustments) to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at September 30, 2004, is as follows:
(a)
 
Adjustment recorded to reflect the estimated difference between fair value and book value based upon preliminary independent valuation counselors report.
(b)
 
Adjustment for a net unamortized plant acquisition adjustment of NUI representing the remaining portion of the excess of the purchase price over the book value of utility net assets acquired in the state of Florida.
(a)
 
Liability to exit a lease for corporate offices in Bedminster New Jersey based upon a preliminary valuation assessment.
(b)
 
Represents a preliminary valuation based upon the net present value of the estimated future net cash flows as determined by the difference between the contractually obligated cash payments for annual demand charges of approximately $5 million through October 2023 on the Patriot Pipeline and the estimated cash recoveries received from remarketing this capacity. The estimated net present value was based on a discount rate of 8% and is amortized on a straight-line basis.
 
 
The $200 million of revenue bonds at rates ranging from 5.25% - 8.00% were not adjusted for purposes of this presentation.
