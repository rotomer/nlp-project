Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On June 27, 2005, at the direction of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the C&MD Committee) of AGL Resources Inc. (the Company), managements Policy Committee adopted the AGL Resources Inc. Annual Incentive Plan - 2005 (the AIP). The AIP is a program under which annual cash incentives are tied to the achievement of Company earnings per share targets, business unit goals and individual performance goals. Most full-time employees, including executive officers, are eligible to participate in the AIP. Under the AIP, the Company is required to meet or surpass a specified corporate earnings per share performance threshold in order for any incentive awards to be made, irrespective of the level of business unit achievement or individual performance achievement. The Companys C&MD Committee is charged with establishing and certifying the levels of corporate performance that must be achieved in order for awards to become payable under the AIP.
Under the AIP, each participant has a target annual incentive compensation opportunity, expressed as a percentage of annual earned base salary. In determining an eligible participants actual incentive award, the plan gives weight to corporate performance, business unit performance (where applicable) and individual performance. Participants eligible for annual incentive awards are generally eligible to receive awards in amounts up to 200% of their target opportunity under the AIP. No incentive awards can be paid under the AIP if the specified corporate earnings per share threshold is not met.
A copy of the AIP is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1.

Q.
What is the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)?
A.
The Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) is a key part of the Companys total compensation program. It is intended to provide a meaningful opportunity to earn cash awards by working together to achieve the Companys performance objectives. The primary features are -
Q.
 
How does the AIP support AGL Resources strategic goals and objectives?
A.
The AIP is designed to align the interests of employees with those of the Companys shareholders and customers as well as with the strategic objectives of the Company. For 2005, our corporate goals are:
 
The AIP pays cash awards to eligible employees if established Performance Measures are met or exceeded during the Performance Measurement Period. Performance Measures include corporate and Business Unit performance goals and your personal IPO and Success Factor ratings.
Q.
 
Who is eligible to participate?
A.
You are eligible to participate in the AIP if you satisfy
all
of the following conditions:
*Union employees are eligible to participate only if their applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) provides for such participation.

Q.
 
Who is ineligible to participate?
A.
Employees in any of the following categories are ineligible -
 
  
Seasonal, part-time, co-op, interns, and contract employees
  
Employees who are eligible to participate in any other annual cash incentive plan
  
Employees hired after September 30, 2005
  
Employees who resign or are discharged on or before the date any awards are paid
  
Union employees whose CBA does not provide for such participation.
Q.
 
What is the Performance Measurement Period?
A.
 
The Performance Measurement Period for the current AIP is the same as the fiscal year of the Company - January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005.
Q
.
 
How does the AIP work?
A.
 
At the beginning of the Performance Measurement Period, corporate performance goals are approved by the Policy Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors. Performance Measures also include: (i) Business Unit goals, which are approved by the Policy Committee; (ii) IPOs, which are established in discussions with your manager; and (iii) Success Factors established for your position
.
 
Based on how we perform at each of those levels as determined at the end of the Performance Period, cash awards, if any, are paid to each participant. These payments are based on your Annual Rate and your Target Award percentage as discussed later in this document.
Q.
 
What are the Performance Measures?
A.
 
Details are provided below for the corporate, Business Unit and individual levels of performance.
Corporate Performance Goals
Corporate performance is measured against the EPS goal approved by the Board of Directors for the Performance Measurement Period and certified by them at the end. For purposes of the AIP, the certified EPS is used as the corporate performance measure in calculating payouts under the plan.
The EPS goal represents an aggressive level of performance intended to encourage participants to extend extraordinary efforts to match the expectations of our investors and customers.
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period (December 31, 2005), the Corporate Performance Score is expressed as a percentage and can range from 0% to 200%.
The following chart shows the approved corporate performance goals for the AIP and corresponding Corporate Performance Scores for the Performance Measurement Period (January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005).
Page 4
2005 Annual Incentive Plan
 
 
 
 
*The Company must meet or surpass $2.30 EPS, the corporate financial performance threshold, for the year ending December 31, 2005 in order for any payment to be made, irrespective of the scores for Business Unit or individual performance.
 
For Officers, EPS must meet or exceed $2.32, a Corporate Performance Score of 75%, before any award payments are earned.
For EPS results falling between the levels noted above, the Corporate Performance Score will be interpolated on a straight-line basis. However, the Corporate Performance Score cannot exceed 200%.
In determining the Corporate Performance Score, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Companys Board of Directors has the discretion to remove the effects of all or a portion of significant one-time items (whether positive or negative) from reported EPS.
Business Unit Performance Goals
Like the Company EPS goal, Business Unit goals are aggressive and intended to provide an incentive for participants to focus their efforts and perform at stretch levels as a team. Business Units represent smaller divisions of AGL Resources that participants impact more directly through their day-to-day performance.
All AGL Resources operations and business locations have been assigned to a Business Unit for performance measurement under the AIP. Each of the following is a separate AIP Business Unit.
All other participants are considered corporate staff for whom no specific Business Unit performance will be measured. However, those in AGL Services Company functions that primarily support Distribution Operations will be assigned separate Business Unit Performance Measures. These will be communicated separately.
Eligible employees in each of these Business Units will have part of their AIP performance measured by the success of their respective Business Unit.  The Business Unit performance goals consist of specific goals with respect to financial performance. 
The precise Business Unit performance goals for 2005 have been established for each Business Unit and have been distributed to the Management Committee members for communication.  These goals contain sensitive information that would be inappropriate to distribute with this document.  A separate document, the 2005 AIP Business Unit Performance Goals Exhibit, is on file with each respective business head and the Policy Committee members.
 
Page 5
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period (December 31, 2005), each Business Units Performance Score is calculated and expressed as a percentage that can range from 0% to 200%.  Targets will equal 100% performance.
 
In determining the exact Business Unit Performance Score, the Policy Committee has the discretion to make appropriate adjustments to the score based on its review of the actual performance of the Business Unit compared to the Business Unit goals as set forth on the 2005 AIP Business Unit Performance Goals Exhibit. As part of its review, the Policy Committee may consider the effect of all or a portion of significant one-time items (whether positive or negative) affecting Business Unit results.
 
Individual Performance Measures
As noted earlier, one of the key objectives of the AIP is to provide recognition of individual contributions to our business success. A related objective is to provide meaningful differentiation of awards. When a participant achieves superior levels of performance, the award they receive will be appropriately greater than the awards received by participants with lower performance ratings.
There are two measures of individual performance - IPOs measure individual performance - the what you achieve and Success Factors measure competencies demonstrated to achieve that performance - the how you achieve. IPOs are set through discussions with your manager. Success Factors have been established for your position and are the same for each person holding the same position. Performance ratings for these two measures will be combined to determine your Individual Performance Score which can range from 0% to 200%. This score will be considered along with the Corporate and Business Unit Performance Scores to determine your Total AIP Performance Score and individual award payout. An example will be provided later in this document.
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period, your IPO and Success Factor performance will be assessed separately using the ratings below. The expected distribution across the Company for the IPO and Success Factor ratings is as follows:
Rating integrity within each functional area and Business Unit is the responsibility of each manager. Rating integrity across functions and Business Units will be the responsibility of the Management Committee.
Once the ratings for each have been determined, both ratings will be combined using a table similar to the one below to determine your Individual Performance Score. This one is provided for illustration only.
Example - Individual Performance Score Matrix
Page 6
2005 Annual Incentive Plan
 
 
 
 
The table will weight the IPO score at approximately 65% of the total with the Success Factor score making up the remainder. This score is used with the Corporate and Business Unit Performance Scores based upon your participation tier to determine your AIP award.
 
Participants who receive a Fails to Meet (FM) rating on either the Success Factor rating or the IPO rating will not be eligible for an incentive award regardless of corporate and Business Unit performance.
A.
 
Because participants have different levels of impact on each of the measures, the AIP will weight each factor differently for different categories of participants. This provides a better line of sight to performance at each participants level in the organization.
Award Weighting Factors
The Performance Measures for corporate, Business Unit and individual performance are weighted so that some Performance Measures will affect your Total AIP Performance Score more than others. Weighting factors are expressed as percentages. The total weight of all of your Performance Measures equals 100%.
The following table shows tiers of participation and the corresponding weight of corporate, Business Unit and individual performance.
* The Policy Committee Officers participate in the Executive Performance Incentive Program as approved by AGL Resources shareholders. It mirrors the corporate EPS portion of the AIP but is subject to the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and the review of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors.
**Subject to the express terms of the relevant CBA.

Q.
 
What is my Target Award?
A.
 
Your Target Award is expressed as a percentage of your Annual Rate and represents the potential amount that you have the opportunity to earn as incentive compensation if the Total AIP Performance Score is 100%. The actual award which you receive, if any, may be greater or less than the Target Award depending on the level of corporate, Business Unit, and individual performance.
The following table shows salary grades and corresponding Target Awards.
Q.
 
How is my AIP award calculated?
A.
 
The calculation of your AIP award begins with your Annual Rate of pay multiplied by your Target Award %. A formula is then applied that includes the Corporate, Business Unit, and Individual Performance Scores weighted according to your participation tier. The examples that follow illustrate this calculation.
Annual Rate
For exempt employees, your Annual Rate is your earned base pay during the Performance Measurement Period as an eligible participant.
For nonexempt employees, your Annual Rate is your earned base pay plus total overtime and shift differential pay earned as an eligible participant during the Performance Measurement Period.
Therefore, Annual Rate will exclude periods when you were on unpaid leave or otherwise inactive or ineligible.
AIP Award Calculation Examples
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period (December 31, 2005), the AIP award is calculated based on your Annual Rate, Target Award, and Total AIP Performance Score.
In the following two examples, an AIP award is calculated using different sets of assumptions for Mary and John.
Page 8
2005 Annual Incentive Plan
 
 
 
 
Example A - MARY
Step 1
- Determine performance scores for each element - Corporate, Business Unit and Individual
From the table on page 5, EPS at $2.35 = a Corporate Performance Score of 100%
*
The Company must meet or surpass $2.30 EPS ($2.32 for Officers) for any payment to be made under the AIP. For EPS results falling between the levels noted above, the Corporate Performance Score will be interpolated. However, the Corporate Performance Score cannot exceed 200%.
The Corporate Performance Score of 100% will be entered into the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
Chattanooga Gas Companys performance is combined with other Georgia and Tennessee distribution operations results and compared to the Business Unit performance goals. A combined Business Unit Performance Score is then determined for all participants in the Business Unit. In this example, we are assuming a Business Unit Performance Score of 95% which will be entered into the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in step 3.
Using the matrix provided, Marys Success Factor rating (SM) and IPO rating (ME) combine to produce an Individual Performance Score of 135%.
 
The Individual Performance Score of 135% will be entered in the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
Page 9
Step 2
- Calculation of Annual Rate
Annual salary of $75,000 for six months = $37,500
Annual salary of $80,000 for six months = $40,000
Annual Rate = $77,500
The Annual Rate of $77,500 will be entered in the award calculation formula in Step 4.
Step 3
- Calculation of Total AIP Performance Score
Step 4
- Award Calculation
Multiply Marys Annual Rate ($77,500) times her Target Award percentage (10%) and her Total AIP Performance Score (116.25%).
AIP Award = $77,500 x 10% x 116.25% =
$9,009.38
Example B - JOHN
Step 1
- Determine performance scores for each element - Corporate and
 
Individual
From the table on page 5, EPS at $2.32 = Corporate Performance Score of 75%
Page 10
2005 Annual Incentive Plan
 
 
 
 
* The Company must meet or surpass $2.30 EPS ($2.32 for Officers) for any payment to be made under the AIP. For EPS results falling between the levels noted above, the Corporate Performance Score will be interpolated. However, the Corporate Performance Score cannot exceed 200%.
The Corporate Performance Score of 75% will be entered into the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3
Johns Success Factor rating (ME) and IPO rating (PM) combine to produce an Individual Performance Score of 85% in the matrix example.
 
The Individual Performance Score of 85% will be entered in the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
Step 2
- Calculation of Annual Rate
Annual Salary of $38,000 for three months (excludes the period on inactive status) = $9,500
Annual salary of $39,500 for six months = $19,750
Overtime earnings during 2005 = $2,750
Annual Rate = $9,500 + $19,750 + $2,750 = $32,000
The Annual Rate of $32,000 will be entered in the award calculation formula in Step 4.
Step 3
- Calculation of Total AIP Performance Score
Page 11
2005 Annual Incentive Plan
 
 
 
 
Step 4
- Award Calculation
Multiply Johns Annual Rate ($32,000) times his Target Award percentage (4%) and his Total AIP Performance Score (80%).
AIP Award = $32,000 x 4% x 80% =
$1,024.00
Q.
 
What is the timing for payment of AIP awards?
A.
 
The current AIP Performance Measurement Period is January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005.Payment of awards, if any, will occur as soon as administratively practicable during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, but not later than March 15, 2006.
Corporate conditions -
Individual conditions -
Q.
 
What about a change in status during the Performance Measurement Period?
A.
 
That will depend on the type of change as follows:
Salary Grade or Transfer
 
- For purposes of calculating an AIP award, if you had a change in salary grade, FLSA classification (exempt or nonexempt) or Business Unit during the Performance Measurement Period, then your award, if any, will be based on your salary grade level FLSA classification and Business Unit on December 31, 2005. Please note that for purposes of calculating the AIP award, the PAN reflecting that change must be in place no later than December 23, 2005.
Employees are not eligible to participate in multiple annual cash incentive plans simultaneously. Participants in plans other than AIP who transfer into the AIP during the Performance Measurement Period will receive a prorated payment, if any is earned under the AIP, based on the effective date of the transfer. Payments, if any, under the other incentive plan will be pursuant to the terms of the plan. Managers of transferring employees should complete performance review forms at the time of transfer and provide a copy to the employees new manager.
Retirement
- If you retire on or before the date that any awards are paid (
i.e.,
the date that award payments are distributed) under the terms of the AGL Resources Retirement Plan or any other retirement plan approved by the Board of Directors for that purpose, you will be eligible for payment of an award. Your award, if any, will be prorated based on your Annual Rate and your salary grade level and Business Unit as of your retirement date or December 31, 2005, whichever is earlier.
Death or Long Term Disability
 
- If you die or are placed on Long Term Disability under AGL
Resources LTD Plan during the Performance Period as an eligible participant and AIP awards are paid at the end of the Performance Period, you, or in the case of your death your estate, will receive a prorated payment representing the time of your active participation during the Performance Period.
Page 12
Resignation, Severance or Discharge
- If you resign or are discharged on or before the date when any awards are paid (
i.e
., the date that payment amounts are actually distributed), you will not be eligible for payment of an award, even if your severance, if any, extends past that date.
Leaves of Absence
 
Q
.
 
What is the effect of the AIP award on other benefits?
A.
 
AIP awards count as compensation for the Retirement Savings Plus (RSP) Plan and Nonqualified Savings Plan (NSP). Awards also count as compensation for participants subject to the Career Average Earnings formula under the AGL Resources Retirement Plan, but do not count as compensation for participants subject to the Final Average Earnings formula under the AGL Retirement Plan.
Q.
 
Who administers the AIP?
A.
 
The AIP will be administered by the Policy Committee of the Company. Except as otherwise set forth in this document, no person, other than members of the Committee, will have any discretion concerning decisions affecting the AIP.

As a result, awards granted to Covered Persons, as that term is defined under Section 162(m), and intended to qualify as qualified performance-based compensation will be granted under the Companys Executive Performance Incentive Plan, or a successor to such plan.  However, to the extent permitted under Section 162(m), the awards granted to such Covered Persons will be calculated in the same manner as awards issued pursuant to this AIP.
Q.
 
Does participation in the AIP create employment rights for AIP participants?
A.
 
The AIP does not constitute a contract of employment and participation in the AIP will not give a participant the right to continue in the employ of the Company on a full-time, or any other basis. Participation in the AIP will not give any participant any right or claim to any benefit under the AIP, unless such right or claim has specifically been granted by the Policy Committee under the terms of the AIP.
