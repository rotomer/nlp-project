ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
The undersigned registrant hereby amends its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 7, 2006 to include disclosure concerning the adoption of the AGL Resources Inc. Annual Incentive Plan - 2006 and restricted stock unit and performance cash unit awards to the named executive officers. This report also includes disclosure concerning change in control agreements with the named executive officers.
 
Item 1.01
 
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Annual Incentive Plan
On February 17, 2006, at the direction of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the C&MD Committee) of AGL Resources Inc. (the Company), managements Policy Committee adopted the AGL Resources Inc. Annual Incentive Plan - 2006 (the AIP).
In determining the named executive officers actual incentive awards, the plan gives weight to corporate performance and individual performance. Corporate performance is measured against the corporate earnings per share performance goal approved by the C&MD Committee and individual performance goals are linked directly to the Companys goals and objectives. A copy of the AIP is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1.
Long-Term Incentive Grants
On February 17, 2006, the C&MD Committee approved restricted stock unit and performance cash unit awards to certain of its executive officers, other officers and key employees, including the following named executive officers:
The awards were made pursuant to the Companys Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (1999) (the Plan), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission with the Companys quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2002. A form of restricted stock unit agreement and performance cash unit agreement are filed with this report as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively.
If the performance measure for the restricted stock units, which is a basic earnings per share goal set forth in the restricted stock unit agreement, is met or exceeded, the restricted stock units will be converted to an equal number of shares of Company common stock and vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the restricted stock unit agreement. If the performance measure set forth in the agreement is not attained, the restricted stock units will be forfeited. Upon a change in control of the Company, (i) the restricted stock units will convert to an equal number of shares of Company common stock and become 100% vested and nonforfeitable and (ii) any outstanding unvested shares of restricted stock will become 100% vested and nonforfeitable. Unless the C&MD Committee, which administers the Plan, decides otherwise, if the recipients employment is terminated for any reason, all restricted stock units or shares of restricted stock will be forfeited and returned to the Company.
The performance cash units are payable in cash based upon the attainment of the performance measure set forth in the award agreement, which relates to the Companys average annual growth in basic earnings per share plus the average dividend yield (the Performance Measure). As set forth in the award agreements, the formula used to calculate award payments is: base salary, multiplied by the Performance Measure, multiplied by the applicable performance multiple reflected in the table above. The award agreements also set forth a minimum Performance Measure percentage below which no award payments will be made and a maximum Performance Measure percentage at which award payments will be capped. Upon a change in control of the Company, performance cash units will become vested and nonforfeitable at the target payout level, as prorated on a daily basis based on the completed portion of the performance measurement period as of the date of the change in control. Unless the C&MD Committee, which administers the Plan, decides otherwise, if the recipients employment is terminated for any reason, all performance cash units will be forfeited.
Change in Control Agreements
Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Martinez.
Mr. Martinez entered into a change in control agreement with AGL Resources on February 24, 2006 with an effective date of January 1, 2006, pursuant to which he will be entitled to receive, upon a qualifying termination (as described below) following a change in control event set forth in the agreement, a severance benefit equal to three times the sum of his base salary plus the highest annual incentive compensation during the three years prior to the year of the qualifying termination; at the time of the qualifying termination, a prorated annual incentive compensation payment for the year of the qualifying termination, based on the number of days Mr. Martinez was employed by the Company during that year; a three-year continuation of medical, dental and life insurance benefits; vesting of all long-term incentive compensation; payment of any forgone employer contributions under the Companys Retirement Savings Plus Plan and Non-qualified Savings Plan; an additional payment based upon participation in the Companys Retirement Plan and Excess Benefit Plan; and outplacement assistance. A qualifying termination will occur if on or before the second anniversary of the date of the consummation of the change in control, Mr. Martinezs employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or voluntarily terminated for good reason (as defined in the agreement). Mr. Martinez may also receive reimbursement of legal fees in connection with the enforcement of his rights under the agreement. In addition, he may receive a payment to offset potential excise taxes, if payments under the agreement are deemed excess parachute payments and such excess payments are at least 10% greater than the maximum amount allowed, without imposition of the excise tax, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The term of Mr. Martinezs agreement ends on November 30, 2007.
Existing Change in Control Agreements with Named Executive Officers.
On February 24, 2006, the Company gave notice of non-renewal to the named executive officers with existing change in control agreements that the existing agreements will not be extended beyond the last date of their now current term, which ends on November 30, 2007. Each of the existing agreements was amended to clarify that following a change in control, the executive can terminate his or her employment for good reason (as defined in the agreement) if, among other things, there is an adverse change in the executives base salary or annual incentive opportunity. The agreements previously were unclear as to whether incentive opportunity included both annual and long-term incentive opportunities. Additionally, Mr. Evans agreement was further amended to reflect an ending date of November 30, 2007, to be coterminous with the other existing change in control agreements. Finally, in light of recent changes to his responsibilities, Mr. Maddens agreement was further amended to delete, from the definition of good reason, the trigger caused by certain changes in his organizations reporting structure.
Copies of Mr. Martinezs change in control agreement and each of the named executive officers notices regarding non-renewal of and amendment to their change in control agreements are attached as separate exhibits to this report.

2006 Annual Incentive Plan
Q.
What is the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)?
A.
 
The Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) is a key part of the Companys total compensation program. It is intended to provide a meaningful opportunity to earn cash awards by working together to achieve the Companys performance objectives. The primary features are -
 
Q.
How does the AIP support AGL Resources strategic goals and objectives?
A.
 
The AIP is designed to align the interests of employees with those of the Companys shareholders and customers as well as with the strategic objectives of the Company. For 2006 our corporate goals are:
The AIP pays cash awards to eligible employees if established Performance Measures are met or exceeded during the Performance Measurement Period. Performance Measures may include corporate and/or Business Unit performance goals and your Individual Performance Score, which is based on both your IPO and Success Factor ratings.
 
Q.
Who is eligible to participate?
A.
 
You are eligible to participate in the AIP if you satisfy all of the following conditions:
*Union employees are eligible to participate only if their applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) provides for such participation
 
Q.
Who is ineligible to participate?
A
 
Employees in any of the following categories are ineligible -

2006 Annual Incentive Plan
 
 
Q.
What is the Performance Measurement Period?
A.
 
The Performance Measurement Period for the current AIP is January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
 
Q
.
How does the AIP work?
A.
 
At the beginning of the Performance Measurement Period, corporate performance goals (earnings per share or EPS) are approved by the Policy Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors. Performance Measures also include: (i) Business Unit performance goals, which are approved by the Policy Committee; (ii) IPOs, which are established in discussions with your manager; and (iii) Success Factors established for your position
.
 
Based on how we perform at each of those levels as determined at the end of the Performance Period, cash awards, if any, are paid to each participant. These payments are based on your Annual Rate and your Target Award percentage as discussed later in this document.
 
Q.
What are the Performance Measures?
Details are provided below for the corporate, Business Unit and individual levels of performance.
A.
 
Corporate Performance Goals
Corporate performance is measured against the EPS goal approved by the Board of Directors for the Performance Measurement Period and certified by them at the end. For purpose of the AIP, the certified EPS is used as the corporate performance measure in calculating payouts under the plan.
The EPS goal represents an aggressive goal intended to provide an incentive for participants to extend extraordinary efforts to match the expectations of our investors and customers.
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period (December 31, 2006), the Corporate Performance Score is expressed as a percentage and can range from 0% to 200%.
The following chart shows the approved corporate performance goals for the AIP and corresponding Corporate Performance Scores for the Performance Measurement Period (January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006).
*The Company must meet or surpass $2.58 EPS for the year ending December 31, 2006, the corporate financial performance threshold, in order for any payment to be made, despite the level of your Business Unit performance or Individual Performance Score.
 
 
For EPS results falling between the levels noted above, the Corporate Performance Score will be interpolated on a straight-line basis. However, the Corporate Performance Score cannot exceed 200%.
4
2006 Annual Incentive Plan
 
In determining the Corporate Performance Score, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Companys Board of Directors has the discretion to remove the effects of all or a portion of significant one-time items (whether positive or negative) from reported EPS.
Business Unit Performance Goals
Like the Company EPS goal, Business Unit goals are aggressive and intended to provide an incentive for participants to focus their efforts and perform at stretch levels as a team. Business Units represent smaller divisions of AGL Resources that participants impact more directly through their day-to-day performance.
All AGL Resources operations and business locations have been assigned to a Business Unit for performance measurement under the AIP. Each of the following is a separate AIP Business Unit.
Eligible employees in each of these Business Units will have part of their AIP performance measured by the success of their respective Business Unit.  The Business Unit Performance Goals consist of specific goals with respect to financial performance. 
The precise Business Unit Performance Goals for 2006 have been established for each Business Unit and have been distributed to the Management Committee members for communication.  These goals contain sensitive information that would be inappropriate to distribute with this document.  A separate document, the 2006 AIP Business Unit Performance Goals Exhibit, is on file with each respective business head and the Policy Committee members.
 
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period (December 31, 2006), each Business Units Performance Score is calculated and expressed as a percentage that can range from 0% to 200%.  Targets will equal 100% performance.
 
In determining the Business Unit Performance Score, the Policy Committee has the discretion to adjust for the effects of all or a portion of significant one-time items (whether positive or negative) affecting the score based on its review of the actual performance of the Business Unit compared to the Business Unit goals as set forth on the 2006 AIP Business Unit Performance Goals Exhibit.
 
Individual Performance
As noted earlier, one of the key objectives of the AIP is to provide recognition of individual contributions to our business success. A related objective is to provide meaningful differentiation of awards. When a participant achieves superior levels of performance, the award they receive is appropriately greater than the awards received by participants with lower performance ratings.
There are two measures of individual performance - IPOs measure individual performance - the what you achieve and Success Factors measure competencies demonstrated to achieve that performance - the how you achieve. Performance ratings for these two measures will be combined to determine your Individual Performance Score which can range from 0% to 200%. This score will be considered along with the Corporate and Business Unit Performance Scores to determine your individual award payout. An example will be provided later in this document.
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period, your IPO and Success Factor performance will be assessed separately using the ratings below.
5
2006 Annual Incentive Plan
 
The two ratings (for IPO and Success Factor performance) will be combined to calculate your AIP award. See that discussion below.
The expected distribution across the Company for the Individual Performance Score ratings is as follows:
Rating integrity within each functional area and Business Unit is the responsibility of each manager. Rating integrity across functions and Business Units will be the responsibility of the Management Committee.
The Individual Performance Score will be a composite of the IPO and the Success Factor ratings. Once the ratings for each have been determined, the Individual Performance Score will be derived from a matrix similar to the following. This one is provided for illustration only.
Example - Individual Performance Score Matrix
The table will weight the IPO score at approximately 65% of the total and the Success Factor score at approximately 35% of the total. This score is used with the Corporate and Business Unit Performance Scores based upon your participation tier to determine your AIP award.
 
Participants who receive a Fails to Meet (FM) rating on either the Success Factor rating or the IPO rating will not be eligible for an incentive award regardless of Corporate and Business Unit performance.
 
 
Q.
How will the Corporate Performance Score, Business Unit Performance Score and Individual Performance Score be weighted?
A.
 
Because participants have different levels of impact on each of the measures, the AIP will weight each factor differently for different categories of participants. This provides a better line of sight to performance at each participants level in the organization.
Award Weighting Factors
The Performance Measures for corporate, Business Unit and individual performance are weighted so that some Performance Measures will affect your Total AIP Performance Score more than others. Weighting factors are expressed as percentages. The total weight of all of your Performance Measures equals 100%.
6
2006 Annual Incentive Plan
 
The following table shows tiers of participation and the corresponding weight of corporate, Business Unit and individual performance.
* The Policy Committee Officers participate in the Executive Performance Incentive Program as approved by AGL Resources shareholders. It mirrors the corporate EPS portion of the AIP but is subject to the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and the review of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors.
**Subject to the express terms of the relevant CBA.
 
Q
.
What is my Target Award?
A.
 
Your Target Award is expressed as a percentage of your Annual Rate and represents the potential amount that you have the opportunity to earn as incentive compensation if the Total AIP Performance Score is 100%. The actual award which you receive, if any, may be greater or less than the Target Award depending on the level of corporate, Business Unit, and individual performance.
The following table shows salary grades and corresponding Target Awards.
Note that your Target Award % may change through the course of the year if you are assigned to another position. If that occurs, your award calculation will prorate the target and earnings for the time in each position.

2006 Annual Incentive Plan
 
Q
.
How is my AIP award calculated?
A.
 
The calculation of your AIP award begins with your Annual Rate of pay multiplied by your Target Award %. A formula is then applied that includes the Corporate, Business Unit, and Individual Performance Scores weighted according to your participation tier. The examples below illustrate this calculation.
Annual Rate
For exempt employees, your Annual Rate is your earned base pay during the Performance Measurement Period as an eligible participant.
For nonexempt employees, your Annual Rate is your earned base pay plus total overtime, shift differential pay and other pay premiums earned as an eligible participant during the Performance Measurement Period.
Therefore, Annual Rate will exclude periods when you were on unpaid leave or otherwise inactive or ineligible.
AIP Award Calculation Examples
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period (December 31, 2006), the AIP award is calculated based on your Annual Rate, Target Award, and Total AIP Performance Score.
In the two examples below, an AIP award is calculated using different sets of assumptions for Mary and John.
Example A - MARY
Step 1
- Determine performance scores for each element - Corporate, Business Unit and Individual
Corporate result: EPS = $2.63
From the table, EPS at $2.63 = a Corporate Performance Score of 100%
*
The Company must meet or surpass $2.58 EPS. For EPS results falling between the levels noted above, the Corporate Performance Score will be interpolated. However, the Corporate Performance Score cannot exceed 200%.
8
2006 Annual Incentive Plan
 
The Corporate Performance Score of 100% will be entered into the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
Chattanooga Gas Companys performance is combined with other Georgia and Tennessee distribution operations results and compared to the Business Unit performance goals. A combined Business Unit Performance Score is then determined for all participants in the Business Unit. In this example, we are assuming a Business Unit Performance Score of 95% which will be entered into the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in step 3.
Using the matrix provided, Marys Success Factor rating (SM) and IPO rating (ME) combine to produce an Individual Performance Score of 135%.
The Individual Performance Score of 135% will be entered in the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
Step 2
- Calculation of Annual Rate
Annual salary of $75,000 for one month = $6,250
Annual salary of $80,000 for eleven months = $73,333
Annual Rate = $78,583
The Annual Rate of $78,583 will be entered in the award calculation formula in Step 4.
Step 3
- Calculation of Total AIP Performance Score
Step 4
- Award Calculation
Multiply Marys Annual Rate ($78,583) times her target award percentage (10%) and her Total AIP Performance Score (116.25%).
AIP Award = $78,583 x 10% x 116.25% =
$9,135.27
9
2006 Annual Incentive Plan
 
Example B - JOHN
Johns Success Factor rating is ME and his IPO rating is SE
Step 1
- Determine performance scores for each element - Corporate and
 
Individual
Corporate result: EPS = $2.60
From the table, EPS at $2.60 = Corporate Performance Score of 75%
For John, since his total performance is based 50% on Business Unit results and 50% on his individual performance, the Corporate result of $2.60 simply means the threshold was exceeded and allows AIP payments to be made.
*
The Company must meet or surpass $2.58 EPS. For EPS results falling between the levels noted above, the Corporate Performance Score will be interpolated. However, the Corporate Performance Score cannot exceed 200%.
The AGL Resources Services Company Business Unit performed at 105% of their target. So the Business Unit Performance Score of 105% will be entered in the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
Johns Success Factor rating (ME) and IPO rating (SE) combine to produce an Individual Performance Score of 185% in the matrix example.
The Individual Performance Score of 185% will be entered in the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
10
2006 Annual Incentive Plan
 
Step 2
- Calculation of Annual Rate
Annual Salary of $38,000 for nine months (excluding one month on inactive status) = $25,333
Overtime earnings during 2006 = $2,750 while in the grade F position
Annual Rate for the first 9 months = $25,333 + $2,750 = $28,083
Annual salary of $41,000 for three months = $10,250
These rates will be entered into the award calculation in Step 4 with their respective Target Award %.
The Annual Rate of $41,500 will be entered in the award calculation formula in Step 4.
Step 3
- Calculation of Total AIP Performance Score
The Corporate EPS result of $2.60 means AIP payments can be made.
Step 4
- Award Calculation
Multiply Johns Annual Rates ($28,083 and $10,250) times his Target Award percentages (5% and 6%) and his Total AIP Performance Score (145%).
AIP Award = ($28,083 x 5%) + (10,250 x 6%) x 145% = ($1,404.15 + $615) x 145% =
$2,927.77
 
Q.
What is the timing for payment of AIP awards?
A.
 
The current AIP Performance Measurement Period is January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
Payment of awards, if any, will occur as soon as administratively practicable during the first quarter of fiscal 2007, but not later than March 15, 2007.
 
Q.
What about new hires during the Performance Measurement Period?
A.
 
You must be employed by September 30, 2006 to be eligible to participate in the AIP. If you were hired between January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2006, your award, if any, will be prorated based on the number of months in the Performance Measurement Period that you were an eligible employee. If you have entered into an agreement with the Company during the Performance Measurement Period that specifies another arrangement, the terms of your agreement with the Company govern the terms of your AIP award.
 
Q.
What about a change in status during the Performance Measurement Period?
A.
 
That will depend on the type of change as follows:
Salary Grade, Target Award or Transfer
 
- For purposes of calculating an AIP award, if you had a change in salary grade or FLSA classification (exempt or nonexempt), then your award, if any, will be prorated based on your time and earnings in each grade level and FLSA classification. In addition, your award will be prorated if there is a change in your Target Award percentage during the Performance Measurement Period. (See Example B above.) Changes in Business Unit during the Performance Measurement Period will not be tracked. Your Business Unit at the end of the Performance Period will determine the Business Unit Performance Score used in calculating your award.
11
2006 Annual Incentive Plan
 
Employees are not eligible to participate in multiple annual cash incentive plans simultaneously. Participants in plans other than AIP who transfer into the AIP during the Performance Measurement Period will receive a prorated payment, if any is earned under the AIP, based on the effective date of the transfer. Payments, if any, under the other incentive plan will be pursuant to the terms of the plan. Managers of transferring employees should complete performance review forms at the time of transfer and provide a copy to the employees new manager.
Retirement
- If you retire on or before the date that any awards are paid (
i.e.,
the date that award payments are distributed) under the terms of the AGL Resources Retirement Plan or any other retirement plan approved by the Board of Directors for that purpose, you will be eligible for payment of an award. Your award, if any, will be prorated based on the number of months in the Performance Measurement Period that you were an eligible employee and will be based on your salary grade level and Business Unit as of your retirement date or December 31, 2006, whichever is earlier.
Death or Long Term Disability
 
- If you die or are placed on Long Term Disability under AGL
Resources LTD Plan during the Performance Period as an eligible participant and AIP awards are paid at the end of the Performance Period, you, or in the case of your death your estate, will receive a prorated payment representing the time of your active participation during the Performance Period.
Resignation, Severance or Discharge
- If you resign or are discharged on or before the date when any awards are paid (
i.e
., the date that payment amounts are actually distributed), you will not be eligible for payment of an award, even if your severance, if any, extends past that date.
Leaves of Absence
 
 
Q
.
What is the effect of the AIP award on other benefits?
A.
 
AIP awards count as compensation for the Retirement Savings Plus (RSP) Plan and Nonqualified Savings Plan (NSP). Awards also count as compensation for participants subject to the Career Average Earnings formula under the AGL Resources Retirement Plan, but do not count as compensation for participants subject to the Final Average Earnings formula under the AGL Retirement Plan.
 
Q.
Who administers the AIP?
A.
 
The AIP will be administered by the Policy Committee of the Company. Except as otherwise set forth in this document, no person, other than members of the Committee, will have any discretion concerning decisions affecting the AIP.
The Committee will have the authority to interpret the AIP and establish such rules and regulations as it deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of the AIP, and will make determinations and will take such other action in connection with or in relation to accomplishing the objectives and goals of the AIP, including adjusting individual awards as it deems necessary or advisable. Each determination or other action made or taken by the Committee pursuant to the AIP, including interpretation of the AIP and the specific conditions and provisions of the awards granted hereunder will be final and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons.
12
2006 Annual Incentive Plan
 
The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Companys Board of Directors will have the sole authority to determine and certify the corporate performance, following the end of the Performance Measurement Period.
 
Q
.
Are awards under the AIP intended to qualify under Section 162(m)?
A.
 
In order to qualify for the exemption under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, awards must be issued under a plan that has been approved by shareholders. As a result, awards granted to Covered Persons, as that term is defined under Section 162(m), and intended to qualify as qualified performance-based compensation will be granted under the Companys Executive Performance Incentive Plan, or a successor to such plan.  However, to the extent permitted under Section 162(m), the awards granted to such Covered Persons will be calculated in the same manner as Awards issued pursuant to this AIP.
 
Q.
Does participation in the AIP create employment rights for AIP participants?
A.
 
The AIP does not constitute a contract of employment and participation in the AIP will not give a Participant the right to continue in the employ of the Company on a full-time, or any other basis. Participation in the AIP will not give any participant any right or claim to any benefit under the AIP, unless such right or claim has specifically been granted by the Policy Committee under the terms of the AIP.
 
Q
.
What law is the AIP governed by?
A.
 
The AIP and all rules and determinations made and taken pursuant hereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, to the extent not preempted by federal law, and construed accordingly.
 
 
Q
.
What is the source of the funds required to pay benefits under the AIP?
A.
 
The funds used to pay AIP benefits will be paid from the Companys general assets.
 
Q
.
Will taxes be withheld from my award?
A.
 
Your award is considered supplemental income and is subject to federal and state income tax withholding, as well as the employee portion of social security (FICA) and Medicare taxes.
 
Q.
Can the Company amend or terminate the AIP?
A.
 
The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the AIP at any time at its discretion.

(A)
  
the Executive's employment had continued through the Severance Period;
 
(B)
  
the Executive's compensation recognized by each such plan (with respect to the Savings Plan, subject to any Code limitations on covered compensation under qualified plans) would, during the Severance Period, have been equal to (1) the Executive's annual rate of base salary at the time of the Qualifying Termination or, if greater, at the earliest of the date of the Announcement, the date of a Change in Control or the date of the Consummation of a Change in Control Transaction, and (2) the Annual Bonus Amount; and

SECTION 4
  
 
 
 
4.1.
  
Limitation on Payments and Benefits

(a)
  
If any of the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement and/or under any other agreement with, or plan of, the Company or one of its subsidiaries (the "Total Payment") (a) constitute a "parachute payment" as defined in Code Section 280G and exceed three (3) times the Executive's "base amount" as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) by less than ten percent (10%) of three (3) times the Executive's base amount, and (b) would, but for this Section 4.1, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, then the Executive's payments and benefits under this Agreement shall be reduced and payable only as to the maximum amount which would result in no portion of such Total Payment being subject to excise tax under Code Section 4999.
 
(b)
  
If a reduction of the Total Payment is necessary under this section, the Executive shall be entitled to select which payments and/or benefits will be reduced and the manner and method of any such reduction. Within ten (10) days after the amount of any required reduction in payments and benefits is finally determined under Section 4.3, the Executive shall notify the Company in writing regarding which payments and benefits are to be reduced. If no notification is given by the Executive, the Company will determine which payments and/or benefits to reduce. If the Company is required to determine which payments and/or benefits to reduce, it shall make such determination as soon as practicable, but no later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the amount of any required reduction in payments and benefits is finally determined under Section 4.3. If, as a result of any reduction required by this section, amounts previously paid or benefits previously provided to the Executive exceed the amount to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive will promptly return the excess amount to the Company.
 
4.2.
  
Gross Up Payments for Excise Tax
. If the Total Payment constitutes a "parachute payment" as defined in Code Section 280G and exceeds three (3) times the Executive's "base amount" as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) by at least ten percent (10%) of three (3) times the Executive's base amount, the Company shall provide to Executive, in cash, an additional payment in an amount to cover the full excise tax due under Code Section 4999 (including any interest and/or penalties), plus the Executive's city, state and federal income and employment taxes on this additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment"). Any amount payable under this Section 4.2 shall be paid as soon as possible following the date of the Executive's Qualifying Termination, but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days after such date.
 
4.3.
  
Accounting Firm
. All determinations required to be made under this Section 4, including whether reductions are necessary or whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of any such reduction or Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be used in determining such reduction or payment, shall be made by the accounting firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and to Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of a notice from the Company or Executive that there has been a Qualifying Termination or another event that could result in parachute payments under Code Section 280G, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. The Company shall not select as the Accounting Firm for this purpose any accountant or auditor for the individual, entity, or group effecting the Change in Control transaction (other than the Company) or any accountant or auditor that is precluded from providing the services required by this Section 4. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.
 
4.4.
  
Subsequent Recalculation
. If Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under Section 4.2 and the Internal Revenue Service subsequently increases the excise tax owed by the Executive, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the full amount necessary to make the Executive whole on an after-tax basis (less any amounts received by the Executive that the Executive would not have received had the computations initially been computed as subsequently adjusted), taking into consideration the amount of any underpaid excise tax, and any related interest and/or penalties owed to the Internal Revenue Service.
 
SECTION 5
  
 
 
 
5.1.
  
Successors
. The Company shall require any successor (whether pursuant to a Change in Control transaction, direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform them if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall constitute a material breach of the Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to terminate the Executive's employment with Good Reason immediately prior to or at any time after such succession. Any successor to the Company shall be deemed to be the Company for all purposes of this Agreement.
 
5.2.
  
Assignment by Executive
. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's executor and/or administrators, heirs, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive should die while any amount would be payable to Executive hereunder had the Executive continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's estate. Executive's rights hereunder shall not otherwise be assignable.
 
SECTION 6

The Company's business, as that term is used herein, includes, but is not limited to, the Company's and any of its subsidiaries' records, processes, methods, data, reports, information, documents, equipment, training manuals, customer lists and business secrets. Executive further agrees that, during the twenty-four (24) month period following a Qualifying Termination, Executive shall not initiate contact with employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for employment outside the Company or one of its subsidiaries, including those employees who were employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries up to and including the date of the Qualifying Termination; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Executive from responding to contacts initiated by such employees.

SECTION 7
  
 
 
 
7.1.
  
Contractual Rights to Benefits
. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing herein contained shall require or be deemed to require the Company to segregate, earmark, or otherwise set aside any funds or other assets, in trust or otherwise, to provide for any payments to be made or required hereunder; provided, however, that the Company may segregate, earmark, or otherwise set aside any funds or other assets, in trust or otherwise as it deems appropriate.
 
7.2.

Except as provided in Section 3.1(a) with respect to Accrued Benefits and the Prorated Annual Bonus, and except as otherwise provided in Section 7.8, the provisions of this Agreement, and any payment provided for herein, shall not supercede or in any way limit the rights, benefits, duties or obligations which the Executive may have now or in the future under any benefit, incentive or other plan or arrangement of the Company or a subsidiary or any other agreement with the Company or a subsidiary.
 
7.3.
  
Legal Fees and Expenses

7.4.

. Notice of any dispute or controversy arising under this Agreement shall be provided in writing to the other party.
