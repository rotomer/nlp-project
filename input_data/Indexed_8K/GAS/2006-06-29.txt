(i)
  
against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in the Time of Sale Information or in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(ii)
  
against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company and the Guarantor; and
 
(iii)
  
against any and all reasonable expense as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representative), incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above;

(c)
  
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representative, and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company or the Guarantor. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 7 or Section 8 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
 
20
 
 
(d)
  
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
 
If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
 
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantor and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor or by the Underwriters and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
 
21
 
 
The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company or the Guarantor, each officer of the Company or the Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or the Guarantor. The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
 
 
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company, the Guarantor or any of their subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters.

(b)
  
Liabilities
 
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 5 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 7, 8 and 9 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
 
 
If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the Defaulted Securities), the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
 
(a)
  
if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
 
(b)
  
if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term Underwriter includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 11.

Exhibit 4.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
This Security is a global security within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of a depositary (as defined in the Indenture) or a nominee thereof. This global security is exchangeable for securities registered in the name of a person other than the depositary or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture and, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for securities in definitive form, this global security may not be transferred except as a whole by the depositary to a nominee of the depositary, or by a nominee of the depositary to the depositary or another nominee of the depositary, or by the depositary or any such nominee to a successor depositary or a nominee of such successor depositary.
Unless this security is presented by an authorized representative of the Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (DTC), to AGL Capital Corporation (the Company) or its agent for registration of transfer exchange, or payment, and any security issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), any transfer, pledge, or other use hereof for value or otherwise by or to any person is wrongful inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
 
 
No. R-1
Principal Amount: $175,000,000.00
CUSIP No. 001192AF0
Maturity Date: July 15, 2016
AGL Capital Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Nevada (herein called the Company, which terms includes any successor corporation under the Indenture referred to hereinafter), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., as the nominee of The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the principal sum of One Hundred Seventy-Five Million and 00/100 Dollars and to pay interest thereon from June 30, 2006 semi-annually on each Interest Payment Date of January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2007 at 6.375% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or provided for. Interest so payable shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable, and paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be January 1 and July 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities for this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
Payment of the principal of and premium, if any, on this Security at Stated Maturity shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds (except that payment on certificated notes shall be paid by check except in certain circumstances) upon presentation hereof at the offices of The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. or at such other office or agency as may be designated for such purpose by the Company from time to time. Payment of interest on this Security shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds (except that payment on certificated notes shall be paid by check except in certain circumstances) to the Person entitled thereto as indicated in the Security Register. Payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Security, as aforesaid, shall be made in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the Securities), issued and issuable in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of February 20, 2001 (such Indenture as originally executed and delivered and as supplemented or modified, together with any constituent instruments establishing the terms of particular Securities, being herein called the Indenture), between the Company, AGL Resources Inc. and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (herein called the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture, all indentures supplemental thereto or Officers Certificates pursuant to Section 301 of such Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The acceptance of this Security shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement by the Holder hereof to all of the terms and provisions of the Indenture.
If any Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity shall not be a Business Day, payment of the amounts due on this Security on such date may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, as if each such payment were made on the date such payment were due and no interest shall accrue on such amounts for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, to such Business Day.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of this Security of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Trustee to enter into one or more supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, the Indenture with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding under the Indenture, considered as one class; provided, however, that if there shall be Securities of more than one series Outstanding under the Indenture and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Securities of one or more, but less than all, of such series, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that if the Securities of any series shall have been issued in more than one Tranche and if the proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Securities of one or more, but less than all, of such Tranches, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all Tranches so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, in the coin or currency, and in the manner, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the offices of the Trustee or such other office or agency as may be designated by the Company from time to time, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Company may redeem the Securities, in whole or in part, at its option, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed, or as determined by a Quotation Agent (as defined in the Prospectus Supplement dated as of June 30, 2006, to the Prospectus dated as of November 9, 2004, together the Prospectus), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined in the Prospectus) plus 20 basis points.
The Company shall give notice to DTC of any redemption it proposes to make at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, before the redemption date. If the Company redeems only some of the Securities, it is the practice of DTC to determine by lot the amount of the Securities to be redeemed of each of its participating institutions. Notice by DTC to these participants and by participants to street name holders of indirect interests in the Securities shall be made according to arrangements among them and may be subject to statutory or regulatory requirements.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions of the Securities called for redemption.
The Securities of this series are issuable only as registered Securities, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000, and any amount in excess thereof that is an integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series, of any authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same, and of like tenor upon surrender of the Security or Securities to be exchanged at the offices of the Trustee or such other office or agency as may be designated by the Company from time to time.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings given in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated.
The Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
As provided in the Indenture, no recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Securities, or any part thereof, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, or of the indebtedness represented thereby, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement under the Indenture, against, and no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, or be incurred by, any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation (either directly or through the Company or a predecessor or successor corporation), whether by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that the Indenture and all the Securities are solely corporate obligations and that any such personal liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the execution of the Indenture and the issuance of the Securities.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Security is unsecured and is unconditionally guaranteed by AGL Resources Inc.

This
GUARANTEE
of AGL Resources Inc., a Georgia corporation (the Guarantor), is dated as of June 30, 2006.
The Guarantor, for value received, hereby unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a 6.375% Senior Note due 2016 (a Note) of AGL Capital Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the Company), authenticated and delivered by the Trustee pursuant to the terms of an Indenture by and among the Company, the Trustee and the Guarantor dated as of February 20, 2001 (the Indenture), and to the Trustee on behalf of each such Holder, the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, on each such Note, each as provided for pursuant to the terms of such Note when and as the same shall become due and payable, in accordance with the terms of such Note and of the Indenture under which it was issued. In case of the failure of the Company to make any such payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made when and as the same shall become due and payable by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, as if such payment were made by the Company.
The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of such Note or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by the Holder of such Note or by the Trustee with respect to any provisions thereof or of the Indenture, the obtaining of any judgment against the Company or any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. The Guarantor hereby waives the benefits of division and discussion, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to such Note or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Note and in the Guarantees. The Guarantees are guarantees of payment and not of collection. If the Trustee or the Holder of any Note is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or the Guarantor, or any custodian, receiver, liquidator, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official acting in relation to the Company or the Guarantor, any amount paid to the Trustee or such Holder in respect of a Note, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holders of a Note in respect of any amounts paid by the Guarantor on account of such Note pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee or the Indenture; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising out of, or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, on the Note shall have been paid in full.
Capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings given in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated. This Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York.
This Guarantee is executed as of the day and year first above written.

AGL CAPITAL CORPORATION
AGL RESOURCES INC.
10 Peachtree Place
Atlanta, GA 30309
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to AGL Resources Inc., a Georgia corporation (the Guarantor), and as special New York counsel to AGL Capital Corporation, a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Guarantor (the Company, and together with the Guarantor, the Registrants),
in connection with the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission), pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), of a prospectus supplement dated June 27, 2006 (the Prospectus Supplement) to the prospectus of the Registrants dated November 9, 2004 (the Base Prospectus, and together with the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus) included as part of the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-119921) filed by the Guarantor, the Company and AGL Capital Trust III, a Delaware statutory trust, with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act on October 22, 2004 and declared effective by the Commission on November 9, 2004 (the Registration Statement). The Prospectus relates to the public offering by the Company of (a) $175,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2016 (the Notes) to be issued under an Indenture dated as of February 20, 2001 (the Indenture) between the Registrants and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., a New York banking corporation, as trustee (the Trustee), and (b) the related guarantee of the Notes by the Guarantor (the Guarantee, and together with the Notes, the Securities).
The Securities will be sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated June 27, 2006 (the Underwriting Agreement) between the Registrants and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as representative of the several underwriters named therein (the Underwriters). As used herein, the term Notes includes any additional Notes of the same series that the Company subsequently may issue pursuant to the Indenture. This opinion is being
furnishing in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.
In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (a) the Registration Statement; (b) the Base Prospectus; (c) the Prospectus Supplement; (d) the final term sheet filed by the Company with the Commission on June 27, 2006 as a free writing prospectus pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act; (e) the documents filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as of the date thereof; (f) the Indenture;
 
(g) the Articles of Incorporation of the Registrants; (h) the Bylaws of the Registrants; (i) certain resolutions of the Boards of Directors of the Registrants and committees thereof; (j) the Form T-1 Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement; (k) the form of the global certificate evidencing the Notes; (l) the Guarantee, and (m) the Underwriting Agreement, relying specifically as to matters of fact on the representations and warranties made by the Guarantor and the Company in the Underwriting Agreement. We also have examined, and relied as to matters of fact upon, originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such other records, agreements, documents and instruments, including certificates or comparable documents of officers of the Registrants and the Trustee and of public officials, and have made such further investigations, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinion hereinafter set forth.
In making all of the foregoing examinations, we have
assumed the genuineness of all signatures and the capacity and legal competency of all
individuals, the authenticity and completeness of all documents submitted to us as originals, the
conformity to the original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
Except to the extent expressly set forth herein, we have made no independent investigations with regard to matters of fact, and, accordingly, we do not express any opinion as to matters that might have been disclosed by independent verification.
Our opinion set forth below is limited to the laws of the State of New York that are in effect on the date of this letter and that, in our professional judgment, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement. We do not express any opinion herein concerning any other laws. As to certain legal matters relevant to our opinion that are governed by the laws of the State of Nevada, we have relied solely on the opinion of Woodburn and Wedge, Nevada counsel to the Company, and we have made no independent examination of the laws of that state.
This opinion letter is provided for use solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement and may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise relied upon for any other purpose without our express written consent. The only opinion rendered by us consists of those matters set forth in the fifth paragraph hereof, and no opinion may be implied or inferred beyond the opinion expressly stated. Our opinion expressed herein is as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to advise you of any changes in applicable law or any other matters that may come to our attention after the date hereof that may affect our opinion expressed herein.
Based upon the foregoing, it is our opinion that, upon due execution of the Notes by the Company and of the Guarantee by the Guarantor, due authentication of the Notes by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture, issuance and delivery of the Notes against payment therefor as provided in the Underwriting Agreement and delivery of the Guarantee as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes and the Guarantee will be validly issued and will constitute legally binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, in accordance with their terms, except to the extent that (a) enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, and (b) the remedy of specific performance and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to certain defenses and to the discretion of the court before which proceedings may be brought (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
We consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the heading Legal Matters in the Prospectus constituting a part thereof. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
