Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory
Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On August 6, 2007, the AGL Resources Inc. (the Company) Policy Committee (the Policy Committee), which consists of the Companys eight executive officers, adopted the 2007 AGL Resources Inc. Annual Incentive Plan (the AIP).  The AIP, which is administered by the Policy Committee, is a cash incentive program that is intended to provide employees of the Company and its subsidiaries with a meaningful opportunity to earn cash awards by working together to achieve the Companys earnings per share targets, business unit goals and individual employee performance goals.  Most full-time employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, including executive officers, are eligible to participate in the AIP.
 
The Compensation and Management Development Committee (C&MD Committee) of the Companys board of directors is charged with establishing and certifying the corporate performance earnings per share goals that must be achieved in order for associated awards to become payable under the AIP. Pursuant to the terms of the AIP, the Company is required to meet or surpass the established corporate earnings per share performance threshold in order for any incentive awards attributable to corporate or business unit performance to be made.  If the corporate performance threshold is not attained, awards attributable solely to individual performance achievement may still be made, but only upon approval of the C&MD Committee.
 
Under the AIP, a target annual incentive compensation opportunity is provided for each participant based on the participants employment classification (target opportunity), expressed as a percentage of the participants Annual Rate (as defined in the AIP), which, in the case of exempt employees, is equivalent to earned annual base salary.  In determining an eligible participants actual incentive award under the AIP, various weights are assigned to corporate performance, business unit performance (where applicable) and individual performance.  Participants eligible for annual incentive awards generally are eligible to receive awards in amounts up to 200% of their target opportunity under the AIP.   Payment of cash awards under the AIP, if any, are intended to be made by the Company to employees in accordance with the terms of the AIP during the first quarter following the performance measurement period.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, under the terms of the AIP, the Company may amend or terminate the AIP at any time.
The foregoing summary of the AIP is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the AIP, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

.
How does the AIP work?
Awards are paid based upon performance against these preset goals as determined at the end of the Performance Measurement Period.  Additionally, payments are based upon each individuals Annual Rate, Target Award percentage and Total Performance Score as discussed later in this document.
Details are provided below for the Corporate, Business Unit and Individual levels of performance.
A.           
Corporate Performance Goals
Corporate performance is measured against the EPS goal approved by the Board of Directors for the Performance Measurement Period and certified by them at the end of the Performance Measurement Period. For purposes of the AIP, the certified EPS will be will be used as the Corporate Performance Score in calculating payouts under the plan adjusted to reflect the effect of economic value created by the Companys wholesale business unit, but not yet reflected in GAAP earnings reported for the year.  The EPS goal represents an aggressive goal intended to provide an incentive for participants to extend extraordinary efforts to match the expectations of our investors and customers.  At the end of the Performance Measurement Period (December 31, 2007), the Corporate Performance Score is expressed as a percentage and can range from 0% to 200%.

2007 Annual Incentive Plan      
The following chart shows the approved corporate performance goals for the AIP and corresponding Corporate Performance Scores for the Performance Measurement Period (January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007).
* For the purposes of the 2007 AIP, net income and the resulting EPS will be adjusted to reflect the effect of economic value created by the Companys wholesale business unit, but not yet reflected in GAAP earnings reported for the year.
**The Company must meet or surpass $2.65 EPS(the corporate financial performance threshold), for the year ending December 31, 2007  for any corporate or business unit payment to be made.  Corporate payouts between 0% and 50% will be interpolated for EPS results between $2.65 and $2.70.  Payout for IPO performance when EPS is below $2.65 will require Compensation Committee approval.
 
For EPS results falling between the levels noted above, the Corporate Performance Score will be interpolated on a straight-line basis. However, the Corporate Performance Score cannot exceed 200%.
In determining the Corporate Performance Score, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Companys Board of Directors has the discretion to remove the effects of all or a portion of significant one-time items (whether positive or negative) from reported EPS.
Business Unit Performance Goals
Like the Company EPS goal, Business Unit goals are aggressive and intended to provide an incentive for participants to focus their efforts and perform at stretch levels as a team.  Business Units represent smaller divisions of AGL Resources that participants impact more directly through their day-to-day performance.
All AGL Resources operations and business locations have been assigned to a Business Unit for performance measurement under the AIP.  Business Units are divided into Operations and Services.  For the purpose of the 2007 AIP, Operations Business Units consist of:
For the purpose of the 2007 AIP, Services Business Units will be comprised of Corporate Operating Services (COPs) and Distribution Operating Services (DOPs).  Services Business Units will consist of the following:
5
2007 Annual Incentive Plan
 
 
Eligible employees in each of these Business Units will have part of their AIP performance measured by the success of their respective Business Unit.  The Business Unit Performance Goals consist of specific goals with respect to financial performance and other defined performance goals. 
Business Unit goals will be weighted according to the table below
 
Note that whereas Distribution Ops and Pivotal are measured solely upon their own performance, the Services Business Units will be measured upon a combination of the performance of Distribution Ops and Pivotal as well as performance of their own Business Units goals.
Business Unit Performance Goals for 2007 have been established for each Business Unit and distributed to the Management Committee members for communication.  A separate document, the 2007 AIP Business Unit Performance Goals Exhibit, is on file with each respective business head and the Policy Committee members.
 
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period (December 31, 2007), each Business Units Performance Score is calculated and expressed as a percentage that can range from 0% to 200%.  Targets will equal 100% performance.  The Policy Committee will determine the exact performance score at the end of the performance period.
 
In determining the Business Unit Performance Score, the Policy Committee has the discretion to adjust for the effects of all or a portion of significant one-time items (whether positive or negative) affecting the score based on its review of the actual performance of the Business Unit compared to the Business Unit goals as set forth on the 2007 AIP Business Unit Performance Goals Exhibit.
 
Individual Performance
As noted earlier, one of the key objectives of the AIP is to provide recognition of individual contributions to the Companys business success.  A related objective is to provide meaningful differentiation of awards. When a participant achieves superior levels of performance, the award they receive is appropriately greater than the awards received by participants with lower performance ratings.
There are two measures of individual performance.  Individual Performance Objectives (IPOs) measure individual performance against pre-set objectives - the what is achieved and Success Factors measure competencies demonstrated to achieve that performance - the how it is achieved.   Performance ratings for these two measures will be combined to determine an Individual Performance Score, which can range from 0% to 200%.  This score along with the Corporate and Business Unit Performance Scores will be used to determine Total AIP Performance Scores.  An example will be provided later in this document.

2007 Annual Incentive Plan           
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period, IPO and Success Factor performance will be assessed separately using the ratings below.
The two ratings (for IPO and Success Factor performance) will be combined to calculate an Individual Performance Score.
The expected distribution across the Company for the Individual Performance Score ratings is as follows:
Rating integrity within each functional area and Business Unit is the responsibility of each manager.  Rating integrity across functions and Business Units will be the responsibility of the Management Committee.
The Individual Performance Score will be a composite of the IPO and the Success Factor ratings.  Once the ratings for each have been determined, the Individual Performance Score will be derived from the matrix below.
 
The table weights IPO scores at 50% of the total and the Success Factor score at 50% of the total.  This score is used with the Corporate and Business Unit Performance Scores based upon each participants  tier to determine individual AIP awards.
Participants may be scored according to the range within the corresponding cell.  The range may be used to increase or decrease the final score based upon actual performance.  The Policy Committee will be provided with a budget for IPS dollars based upon the central or budget scores within each cell (as indicated in red) to ensure the aggregate scores remain within budget.  This budget will be determined by applying the 2006 IPS ratings to the 2007 targeted Individual Performance earnings.
Participants who receive a Fails to Meet (FM) rating on either the Success Factor rating or the IPO rating will not be eligible for an incentive award regardless of Corporate and Business Unit performance.

Award Weighting Factors
The Performance Measures for Corporate, Business Unit and Individual Performance are weighted so that some Performance Measures affect the Total AIP Performance Score more than others.  Weighting factors are expressed as percentages.  The total weight of all of the Performance Measures always equals 100%.
The following table shows tiers of participation and the corresponding weight of Corporate, Business Unit and Individual Performance.
 
* The Policy Committee Officers participate in the Executive Performance Incentive Program as approved by AGL Resources shareholders.  It mirrors the corporate EPS portion of the AIP, but is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and is subject to the review of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors.
**Subject to the express terms of the relevant CBA.

Annual Rate
For exempt employees, Annual Rate is the earned base pay during the Performance Measurement Period as an eligible participant.
For nonexempt employees, Annual Rate is the earned base pay plus total overtime, shift differential pay and other designated pay premiums earned as an eligible participant during the Performance Measurement Period.
Therefore, Annual Rate will exclude periods when on unpaid leave or otherwise inactive or ineligible.
At the end of the Performance Measurement Period (December 31, 2007), the AIP award is calculated based on Annual Rate, Target Award, and Total AIP Performance Score.
In the two examples below, an AIP award is calculated using different sets of assumptions for Mary and John.
Example A - MARY
 Determine performance scores for each element  Corporate, Business Unit and Individual
Step 1
Corporate result: EPS = $2.80
From the table, EPS at $2.80 = Corporate Performance Score of 100%
* For the purposes of the 2007 AIP, net income and the resulting EPS will be adjusted to reflect the effect of economic value created by the Companys wholesale business unit, but not yet reflected in GAAP earnings reported for the year.
**The Company must meet or surpass $2.65 EPS(the corporate financial performance threshold), for the year ending December 31, 2007  for any corporate or business unit payment to be made.  Corporate payouts between 0% and 50% will be interpolated for EPS results between $2.65 and $2.70.  Payout for IPO performance when EPS is below $2.65 will require Compensation Committee approval.

The Corporate Performance Score of 100% will be entered into the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
The Business Unit Performance Score of 95% will be entered into the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
Using the matrix provided, Marys Success Factor rating (SM) and IPO rating (ME) combine to produce an Individual Performance Score of 125%.  However, her manager received approval to increase Marys score to 135%.
 
 
The Individual Performance Score of 135% will be entered in the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
 Annual Rate
Step 2
Annual rate will be the annualized earnings earned during the performance period.  In Marys case, this will amount to her annual salary of $75,000 for one month (1/12 x $75,000 = $6,250), and her annual salary of $80,000 for the remaining eleven months (11/12 x $80,000 = $73,333).  Her final annual rate will be $79,583
The Annual Rate of $79,583 will be entered in the award calculation formula in Step 4.
 Calculation of Total AIP Performance Score
Step 3
- Award Calculation
Step 4
Multiply Marys Annual Rate ($79,583) times her target award percentage (12%) and her Total AIP Performance Score (116%).
AIP Award = $79,583 x 12% x 116% =

Example B - JOHN
Step 1
 Determine performance scores for each element  Corporate and
 
Individual
Corporate result: EPS = $2.75
From the table, EPS at $2.75 = Corporate Performance Score of 75%
* For the purposes of the 2007 AIP, net income and the resulting EPS will be adjusted to reflect the effect of economic value created by the Companys wholesale business unit, but not yet reflected in GAAP earnings reported for the year.
**The Company must meet or surpass $2.65 EPS(the corporate financial performance threshold), for the year ending December 31, 2007  for any corporate or business unit payment to be made.  Corporate payouts between 0% and 50% will be interpolated for EPS results between $2.65 and $2.70.  Payout for IPO performance when EPS is below $2.65 will require Compensation Committee approval.
 
The Performance Score of 75% will be entered into the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
The Business Unit performed at 105% of their target.  So the Business Unit Performance Score of 105% will be entered in the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
Johns Success Factor rating (ME) and IPO rating (SE) combine to produce an Individual Performance Score of 175% in the matrix example.  In Johns case, his manager received approval to increase his payout to 185% which will be entered in the Total AIP Performance Score calculation in Step 3.
 
11
2007 Annual Incentive Plan
 
 
 Annual Rate
Step 2
Johns annual rate will be the aggregate of earnings including base pay, overtime, shift differential, and any other designated pay premiums earned during the performance period.  For illustration purposes, Johns annual rate is approximated below:
Annual salary of $38,000 for nine months (excluding one month on inactive status) = $25,333
Overtime earnings during 2006 = $2,750 while in the grade F position
Annual Rate for the first 9 months = $25,333 + $2,750 = $28,083
Annual salary of $41,000 for three months = $10,250
The annual rate of $38,333 ($28,083 + $10,250) will be entered into the award calculation in Step 4 with his respective Target Award.
 Calculation of Total AIP Performance Score
Step 3
The Corporate EPS result of $2.79 means AIP payments can be made.
- Award Calculation
Step 4
Multiply Johns Annual Rate ($38,333) times his Target Award percentages (5% and 6%) times the proration factor and his Total AIP Performance Score (150%).
AIP Award = ($38,333 x 5% x 40/52) + (38,333 x 6% x 12/52) x 150% = ($1,474.35 + $530.76) x 150% =
$
3,007.67
Q.        
What is the timing for payment of AIP awards?
Payment of awards, if any, will occur as soon as administratively practicable during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, but not later than March 15, 2008.
12
2007 Annual Incentive Plan
 
 
Eligible participants who change incentive targets during the Performance Measurement Period will receive a prorated incentive based on the week in which the target change becomes effective.  For instance, if a participant is at a grade level with a target award of 5% for 14 weeks and then is promoted to a grade with a target of 6% for the remainder of the year, the 5% target will be prorated by 14/52 and the 6% target will be prorated by 38/52 in the award calculation.
Changes in Business Unit during the Performance Measurement Period will not be tracked.  Only year-end Business Unit performance will be used to determine the Business Unit Performance Score used in calculating awards.  Partial year performance will not be measured.
Employees are not eligible to participate in multiple annual cash incentive plans simultaneously.  Participants in plans other than AIP who transfer into the AIP during the Performance Measurement Period will receive a prorated payment, as earned under the AIP, based on the effective date of the transfer. Payments, if any, under the other incentive plan will be pursuant to the terms of the Plan.  Managers of transferring employees should complete performance review forms at the time of transfer and provide a copy to the employees new manager.
 Employees who retire from active status on or before the date that any awards are paid ( the date that award payments are distributed), under the terms of the AGL Resources Retirement Plan or any other retirement plan approved by the Board of Directors for that purpose, will be eligible for payment of an award.  The award, if any, will be prorated based upon the earnings received while working as an active employee during the Performance Measurement Period.
Retirement
i.e.,
 Employees who terminate due to death or who are placed on Long-Term Disability (LTD) under AGL Resources LTD Plan during the Performance Period, are considered eligible for a prorated payment based upon the earnings received while working as an active employee during the Performance Period.  Awards are paid at the end of the Performance Period to either the employee or, in the case of death, the employees estate.
Death or Long-Term Disability
 
 Employees who resign or are discharged on or before the date when awards are paid (., the date that payment amounts are actually distributed),will not be eligible for payment of an award, even if severance, if any, extends past that date, unless otherwise provided by law.
Resignation, Severance or Discharge
