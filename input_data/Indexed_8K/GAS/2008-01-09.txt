On January 8, 2008, AGL Resources Inc. (the Company) entered into an individual change in control agreement with each of John W. Somerhalder II, Andrew W. Evans, Kevin P. Madden and Douglas N. Schantz, all of whom are named executive officers.  Each of the agreements (which are effective as of December 1, 2007and replaces a similar agreement that expired November 30, 2007) provides that the covered executive will be entitled to receive, upon a qualifying termination (as described below) generally following a change in control event set forth in the agreement, a severance benefit equal to two times the sum of his base salary plus the highest annual incentive compensation during the three years prior to the year of the qualifying termination; at the time of the qualifying termination, a prorated annual incentive compensation payment for the year of the qualifying termination, based on the number of days the executive was employed by the Company during that year; a two-year continuation of medical, dental and life insurance benefits; vesting of all long-term incentive compensation; payment of any forgone employer contributions under the Companys Retirement Savings Plus Plan and Non-qualified Savings Plan; an additional payment based upon participation in the Companys Retirement Plan and Excess Benefit Plan; and outplacement assistance. A qualifying termination will occur if, following a change in control, the executives employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or voluntarily terminated for good reason, (as defined in the agreement) provided, that, such termination occurs on or before the second anniversary of the date of the consummation of the change in control. The covered executive may also receive reimbursement of legal fees in connection with the enforcement of his rights under the continuity agreement as well as a payment to offset potential excise taxes, if payments under the agreement are deemed excess parachute payments.

If, as a result of any reduction required by this section, amounts previously paid or benefits previously provided to the Executive exceed the amount to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive will promptly return the excess amount to the Company.

Any amount payable under this Section 4.2 shall be paid as soon as possible following the date of the Executive's Qualifying Termination, but in no event later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.

The Company shall not select as the Accounting Firm for this purpose any accountant or auditor for the individual, entity, or group effecting the Change in Control transaction (other than the Company) or any accountant or auditor that is precluded from providing the services required by this Section 4.  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.

If Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under Section 4.2 and the Internal Revenue Service subsequently increases the excise tax owed by the Executive, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the full amount necessary to make the Executive whole on an after-tax basis (less any amounts received by the Executive that the Executive would not have received had the computations initially been computed as subsequently adjusted), taking into consideration the amount of any underpaid excise tax, and any related interest and/or penalties owed to the Internal Revenue Service.  This reimbursement for the Gross-Up Payment increase shall be made in no event later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.
Subsequent Recalculation
 
5.1.           .  The Company shall require any successor (whether pursuant to a Change in Control transaction, direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform them if no such succession had taken place.  Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall constitute a material breach of the Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to terminate the Executive's employment with Good Reason immediately prior to or at any time after such succession.  Any successor to the Company shall be deemed to be the Company for all purposes of this Agreement.
Successors
 
5.2.           .  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's executor and/or administrators, heirs, devisees, and legatees.  If the Executive should die while any amount would be payable to Executive hereunder had the Executive continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's estate.

Obligation Absolute; No Effect on Other Rights

WHEREAS, the Executive is a key executive of the Company or one of its subsidiaries and has been designated by the Committee as an executive to be offered such a continuity agreement with the Company.
 
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement, and of other good and valuable consideration including, but not limited to, Executive's continuing employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

(b)           the Executive's continued failure to substantially perform the duties and responsibilities of the Executive's position after written notice from the Company setting forth the particulars of such failure and a reasonable opportunity of not less than thirty (30) business days to cure such failure; or
 
(c)           the Executive's plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, or conviction of, a felony.
 
Cause shall be determined by two-thirds of the members of the Board (excluding for this purpose the Executive if a member of the Board) at a meeting at which the Executive may appear and present his or her position.  No act or failure to act on the part of the Executive shall be considered "willful" unless it is done by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company or one of its subsidiaries.  Any act or failure to act that is based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board, or the advice of counsel for the Company or one of its subsidiaries, shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.

(d)           The date that any one person or Group, acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12) month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than fifty percent (50%) of the total gross fair market value of all assets of the Company immediately before such acquisition or acquisitions.  For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Company, or the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.
 
 
It is intended that there will be a Change in Control under this Agreement only to the extent such event or transaction would constitute a "change in control event" as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) and thus the provisions of the definition of Change in Control shall be applied and interpreted consistent with the provisions of such Treasury Regulation, as amended from time to time; recognizing however, that the definition of Change in Control in this Agreement may be more restrictive in certain respects than the definition contained in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5).

(i)  The Company shall provide the Executive with continued life insurance and disability insurance coverage (provided, however, that long-term disability insurance coverage shall not be provided if, following the Executive's termination of employment, the Executive is not eligible to receive coverage under the Company's group long-term disability insurance policy because the Executive is no longer an employee) on the same basis (including premium) as active employees until the earlier of (i) twenty four (24) months after the Executive's Qualifying Termination, or (ii) the commencement of comparable coverage with a subsequent employer.
 
(ii)  In addition, as long as the Executive pays a monthly premium equal to the amount which is the COBRA premium for such coverage, the Company shall provide the Executive and, as applicable, the Executive's eligible dependents with continued medical and dental coverage, on the same basis (excluding premiums) as provided to the Company's active executives and their dependents, as applicable, until the earlier of (i) twenty four (24) months after the Executive's Qualifying Termination, or (ii) the date the Executive is first eligible for comparable coverage with a subsequent employer.  As a separate payment under this Agreement, each month coverage continues under this clause (ii), the Company shall pay to the Executive an amount equal to the excess of the COBRA premium for such coverage over the active employee cost for such medical coverage, each as determined on the date of the Executives Qualifying Termination.
 
(iii)  The medical coverage provided under this section shall not count against any COBRA continuation coverage required by law.

Limitation on Payments and Benefits
 
(a)           If any of the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement and/or under any other agreement with, or plan of, the Company or one of its subsidiaries (the "Total Payment") (a) constitute a "parachute payment" as defined in Code Section 280G and exceed three (3) times the Executive's "base amount" as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) by less than ten percent (10%) of three (3) times the Executive's base amount, and (b) would, but for this Section 4.1, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, then the Executive's payments and benefits under this Agreement shall be reduced and payable only as to the maximum amount which would result in no portion of such Total Payment being subject to excise tax under Code Section 4999.
 
(b)           If a reduction of the Total Payment is necessary under this section, the Executive shall be entitled to select which payments and/or benefits will be reduced and the manner and method of any such reduction.  Within ten (10) days after the amount of any required reduction in payments and benefits is finally determined under Section 4.3, the Executive shall notify the Company in writing regarding which payments and benefits are to be reduced.  If no notification is given by the Executive, the Company will determine which payments and/or benefits to reduce.  If the Company is required to determine which payments and/or benefits to reduce, it shall make such determination as soon as practicable, but no later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the amount of any required reduction in payments and benefits is finally determined under Section 4.3.  If, as a result of any reduction required by this section, amounts previously paid or benefits previously provided to the Executive exceed the amount to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive will promptly return the excess amount to the Company.  In no instance shall the reductions provided in this Section 4.1 cause the payments required by Sections 3.1(a), (b) or (c) be made any later than two and one-half (2) months after the end of the year in which the Executive terminates employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries.
 
4.2.           .  If the Total Payment constitutes a "parachute payment" as defined in Code Section 280G and exceeds three (3) times the Executive's "base amount" as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) by at least ten percent (10%) of three (3) times the Executive's base amount, the Company shall provide to Executive, in cash, an additional payment in an amount to cover the full excise tax due under Code Section 4999 (including any interest and/or penalties), plus the Executive's city, state and federal income and employment taxes on this additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment").  Any amount payable under this Section 4.2 shall be paid as soon as possible following the date of the Executive's Qualifying Termination, but in no event later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.
Gross Up Payments for Excise Tax
 
4.3.           .  All determinations required to be made under this Section 4, including whether reductions are necessary or whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of any such reduction or Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be used in determining such reduction or payment, shall be made by the accounting firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm").  The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and to Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of a notice from the Company or Executive that there has been a Qualifying Termination or another event that could result in parachute payments under Code Section 280G, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  The Company shall not select as the Accounting Firm for this purpose any accountant or auditor for the individual, entity, or group effecting the Change in Control transaction (other than the Company) or any accountant or auditor that is precluded from providing the services required by this Section 4.  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.
Accounting Firm
 
4.4.           .  If Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under Section 4.2 and the Internal Revenue Service subsequently increases the excise tax owed by the Executive, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the full amount necessary to make the Executive whole on an after-tax basis (less any amounts received by the Executive that the Executive would not have received had the computations initially been computed as subsequently adjusted), taking into consideration the amount of any underpaid excise tax, and any related interest and/or penalties owed to the Internal Revenue Service.  This reimbursement for the Gross-Up Payment increase shall be made in no event later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.
Subsequent Recalculation
 
5.1.           .  The Company shall require any successor (whether pursuant to a Change in Control transaction, direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform them if no such succession had taken place.  Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall constitute a material breach of the Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to terminate the Executive's employment with Good Reason immediately prior to or at any time after such succession.  Any successor to the Company shall be deemed to be the Company for all purposes of this Agreement.
Successors
 
5.2.           .  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's executor and/or administrators, heirs, devisees, and legatees.

Executive's rights hereunder shall not otherwise be assignable.
Assignment by Executive

Except as may be compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction or as may otherwise be required by law, Executive shall take no action (including without limitation the making of any oral or written statement) which action damages the reputation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
7.1.           .  Except as expressly stated herein, nothing herein contained shall require or be deemed to require the Company to segregate, earmark, or otherwise set aside any funds or other assets, in trust or otherwise, to provide for any payments to be made or required hereunder; provided, however, that the Company may segregate, earmark, or otherwise set aside any funds or other assets, in trust or otherwise as it deems appropriate.

Except as provided in Section 3.1(a) with respect to Accrued Benefits and the Prorated Annual Bonus, and except as otherwise provided in Section 7.8, the provisions of this Agreement, and any payment provided for herein, shall not supercede or in any way limit the rights, benefits, duties or obligations which the Executive may have now or in the future under any benefit, incentive or other plan or arrangement of the Company or a subsidiary or any other agreement with the Company or a subsidiary.
Obligation Absolute; No Effect on Other Rights
 
7.3.           .  In addition to all other amounts payable to the Executive under this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Executive's legal fees and expenses (including, without limitation, any and all court costs and attorneys' fees and expenses), as incurred by the Executive in connection with or as a result of any claim, action or proceeding brought by the Company or the Executive with respect to or arising out of this Agreement or any provision hereof; provided, however, in the case of an action brought by the Executive, if it is determined by an arbitrator or by a court of competent jurisdiction that such action was frivolous or without merit, any remaining unpaid legal fees or expenses shall not be paid and the Executive shall repay to the Company all amounts previously paid by the Company under this Section 7.3.  No payment or reimbursement under this Section 7.3 shall be requested or made, after the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.
Legal Fees and Expenses
 
7.4.           .  Notice of any dispute or controversy arising under this Agreement shall be provided in writing to the other party.

Such arbitration shall be conducted before a panel of three (3) arbitrators sitting in a location selected by Executive in the metropolitan area nearest to, and in the same county as, the Executive's place of residence, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  Executive's election to arbitrate, as herein provided, and the decision of the arbitrators in that proceeding, shall be binding on the Company and Executive.  The Company may elect to have a dispute or controversy settled by binding arbitration only if such dispute or controversy arises under Section 6 of this Agreement.

WHEREAS, Executive is presently employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries in a key management capacity; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company's Board of Directors desires to assure, and has determined that it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to reinforce and assure, the continued attention and dedication of certain key executives of the Company and its subsidiaries to their duties of employment without personal distraction or conflict of interest as a result of the possibility or occurrence of a change in control of the Company; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized the Company to enter into continuity agreements with those key executives of the Company and its subsidiaries designated by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee"); and
 
WHEREAS, the Executive is a key executive of the Company or one of its subsidiaries and has been designated by the Committee as an executive to be offered such a continuity agreement with the Company.
 
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement, and of other good and valuable consideration including, but not limited to, Executive's continuing employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

(b)           the Executive's continued failure to substantially perform the duties and responsibilities of the Executive's position after written notice from the Company setting forth the particulars of such failure and a reasonable opportunity of not less than thirty (30) business days to cure such failure; or
 
(c)           the Executive's plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, or conviction of, a felony.
 
Cause shall be determined by two-thirds of the members of the Board (excluding for this purpose the Executive if a member of the Board) at a meeting at which the Executive may appear and present his or her position.  No act or failure to act on the part of the Executive shall be considered "willful" unless it is done by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company or one of its subsidiaries.  Any act or failure to act that is based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board, or the advice of counsel for the Company or one of its subsidiaries, shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.
1.6.           "" shall mean the earliest of the following to occur:
Change in Control
 
(a)           The date any one person, or more that one person acting as a group (as determined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)(B), a "Group"), acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or Group, constitutes more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company.  If any one person or Group is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Company, the acquisition of additional control of the Company by the same person or Group is not considered to cause a Change in Control of the Company;

(d)           The date that any one person or Group, acquires (or has acquired during the twelve (12) month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than fifty percent (50%) of the total gross fair market value of all assets of the Company immediately before such acquisition or acquisitions.  For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Company, or the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.
 
It is intended that there will be a Change in Control under this Agreement only to the extent such event or transaction would constitute a "change in control event" as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) and thus the provisions of the definition of Change in Control shall be applied and interpreted consistent with the provisions of such Treasury Regulation, as amended from time to time; recognizing however, that the definition of Change in Control in this Agreement may be more restrictive in certain respects than the definition contained in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5).

Retirement Plan, as amended (the "Retirement Plan"), and (2) the AGL Resources Inc.

Retirement Savings Plus Plan, as amended (the "Savings Plan"), and/or the AGL Resources Inc. Nonqualified Savings Plan, as amended, determined by assuming that,
 
(A)           the Executive's employment had continued through the Severance Period;
 
(B)           the Executive's compensation recognized by each such plan (with respect to the Savings Plan, subject to any Code limitations on covered compensation under qualified plans) would, during the Severance Period, have been equal to (1) the Executive's annual rate of base salary at the time of the Qualifying Termination or, if greater, at the earliest of the date of the Announcement, the date of a Change in Control or the date of the Consummation of a Change in Control Transaction, and (2) the Annual Bonus Amount; and

Upon the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in each applicable plan or award agreement), all grants and awards shall be subject to the provisions of the plan and award agreements under which they were made.  With regard to any outstanding stock options, the Executive shall have a period of one (1) year (subject to the expiration of the original term of the option) following the date of the Qualifying Termination in which to exercise such options; provided that such extension of the period to exercise shall not extend the exercise period beyond the earlier of (i) the latest date upon which the option could have expired by its terms, or (ii) the tenth (10) anniversary of the original date of grant; and further provided that if the plan or option agreement under which such options were granted provides a longer period of exercise for which the Executive would be eligible, then such longer period shall be available to the Executive.

(ii)  In addition, as long as the Executive pays a monthly premium equal to the amount which is the COBRA premium for such coverage, the Company shall provide the Executive and, as applicable, the Executive's eligible dependents with continued medical and dental coverage, on the same basis (excluding premiums) as provided to the Company's active executives and their dependents, as applicable, until the earlier of (i) twenty four (24) months after the Executive's Qualifying Termination, or (ii) the date the Executive is first eligible for comparable coverage with a subsequent employer.

Limitation on Payments and Benefits
 
(a)           If any of the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement and/or under any other agreement with, or plan of, the Company or one of its subsidiaries (the "Total Payment") (a) constitute a "parachute payment" as defined in Code Section 280G and exceed three (3) times the Executive's "base amount" as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) by less than ten percent (10%) of three (3) times the Executive's base amount, and (b) would, but for this Section 4.1, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, then the Executive's payments and benefits under this Agreement shall be reduced and payable only as to the maximum amount which would result in no portion of such Total Payment being subject to excise tax under Code Section 4999.
 
(b)           If a reduction of the Total Payment is necessary under this section, the Executive shall be entitled to select which payments and/or benefits will be reduced and the manner and method of any such reduction.  Within ten (10) days after the amount of any required reduction in payments and benefits is finally determined under Section 4.3, the Executive shall notify the Company in writing regarding which payments and benefits are to be reduced.  If no notification is given by the Executive, the Company will determine which payments and/or benefits to reduce.  If the Company is required to determine which payments and/or benefits to reduce, it shall make such determination as soon as practicable, but no later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the amount of any required reduction in payments and benefits is finally determined under Section 4.3.  If, as a result of any reduction required by this section, amounts previously paid or benefits previously provided to the Executive exceed the amount to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive will promptly return the excess amount to the Company.  In no instance shall the reductions provided in this Section 4.1 cause the payments required by Sections 3.1(a), (b) or (c) be made any later than two and one-half (2) months after the end of the year in which the Executive terminates employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries.
 
4.2.           .  If the Total Payment constitutes a "parachute payment" as defined in Code Section 280G and exceeds three (3) times the Executive's "base amount" as defined under Code Section 280G(b)(3) by at least ten percent (10%) of three (3) times the Executive's base amount, the Company shall provide to Executive, in cash, an additional payment in an amount to cover the full excise tax due under Code Section 4999 (including any interest and/or penalties), plus the Executive's city, state and federal income and employment taxes on this additional payment (the "Gross-Up Payment").  Any amount payable under this Section 4.2 shall be paid as soon as possible following the date of the Executive's Qualifying Termination, but in no event later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.
Gross Up Payments for Excise Tax
 
4.3.           .  All determinations required to be made under this Section 4, including whether reductions are necessary or whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of any such reduction or Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be used in determining such reduction or payment, shall be made by the accounting firm selected by the Company (the "Accounting Firm").  The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and to Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of a notice from the Company or Executive that there has been a Qualifying Termination or another event that could result in parachute payments under Code Section 280G, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  The Company shall not select as the Accounting Firm for this purpose any accountant or auditor for the individual, entity, or group effecting the Change in Control transaction (other than the Company) or any accountant or auditor that is precluded from providing the services required by this Section 4.  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.
Accounting Firm
 
4.4.           .  If Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under Section 4.2 and the Internal Revenue Service subsequently increases the excise tax owed by the Executive, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the full amount necessary to make the Executive whole on an after-tax basis (less any amounts received by the Executive that the Executive would not have received had the computations initially been computed as subsequently adjusted), taking into consideration the amount of any underpaid excise tax, and any related interest and/or penalties owed to the Internal Revenue Service.  This reimbursement for the Gross-Up Payment increase shall be made in no event later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.
Subsequent Recalculation
 
5.1.           .  The Company shall require any successor (whether pursuant to a Change in Control transaction, direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform them if no such succession had taken place.  Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall constitute a material breach of the Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to terminate the Executive's employment with Good Reason immediately prior to or at any time after such succession.  Any successor to the Company shall be deemed to be the Company for all purposes of this Agreement.
Successors
 
5.2.           .  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's executor and/or administrators, heirs, devisees, and legatees.

The Company's business, as that term is used herein, includes, but is not limited to, the Company's and any of its subsidiaries' records, processes, methods, data, reports, information, documents, equipment, training manuals, customer lists and business secrets.  Executive further agrees that, during the twenty-four (24) month period following a Qualifying Termination, Executive shall not initiate contact with employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for employment outside the Company or one of its subsidiaries, including those employees who were employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries up to and including the date of the Qualifying Termination; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Executive from responding to contacts initiated by such employees.  Except as may be compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction or as may otherwise be required by law, Executive shall take no action (including without limitation the making of any oral or written statement) which action damages the reputation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
7.1.           .

Except as provided in Section 3.1(a) with respect to Accrued Benefits and the Prorated Annual Bonus, and except as otherwise provided in Section 7.8, the provisions of this Agreement, and any payment provided for herein, shall not supercede or in any way limit the rights, benefits, duties or obligations which the Executive may have now or in the future under any benefit, incentive or other plan or arrangement of the Company or a subsidiary or any other agreement with the Company or a subsidiary.
Obligation Absolute; No Effect on Other Rights
 
7.3.           .  In addition to all other amounts payable to the Executive under this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Executive's legal fees and expenses (including, without limitation, any and all court costs and attorneys' fees and expenses), as incurred by the Executive in connection with or as a result of any claim, action or proceeding brought by the Company or the Executive with respect to or arising out of this Agreement or any provision hereof; provided, however, in the case of an action brought by the Executive, if it is determined by an arbitrator or by a court of competent jurisdiction that such action was frivolous or without merit, any remaining unpaid legal fees or expenses shall not be paid and the Executive shall repay to the Company all amounts previously paid by the Company under this Section 7.3.  No payment or reimbursement under this Section 7.3 shall be requested or made, after the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement, and of other good and valuable consideration including, but not limited to, Executive's continuing employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
 
 
 
1.1.           "" shall mean the Executive's earned but unpaid base salary, Earned and Unused Vacation Pay, unreimbursed business expenses and all other amounts earned by (but not paid to) or owed to Executive through and including the date of the Qualifying Termination.

(b)           the Executive's continued failure to substantially perform the duties and responsibilities of the Executive's position after written notice from the Company setting forth the particulars of such failure and a reasonable opportunity of not less than thirty (30) business days to cure such failure; or

If the Company is required to determine which payments and/or benefits to reduce, it shall make such determination as soon as practicable, but no later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the amount of any required reduction in payments and benefits is finally determined under Section 4.3.  If, as a result of any reduction required by this section, amounts previously paid or benefits previously provided to the Executive exceed the amount to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive will promptly return the excess amount to the Company.  In no instance shall the reductions provided in this Section 4.1 cause the payments required by Sections 3.1(a), (b) or (c) be made any later than two and one-half (2) months after the end of the year in which the Executive terminates employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries.
 
4.2.           .

Any amount payable under this Section 4.2 shall be paid as soon as possible following the date of the Executive's Qualifying Termination, but in no event later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.

If Executive is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under Section 4.2 and the Internal Revenue Service subsequently increases the excise tax owed by the Executive, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for the full amount necessary to make the Executive whole on an after-tax basis (less any amounts received by the Executive that the Executive would not have received had the computations initially been computed as subsequently adjusted), taking into consideration the amount of any underpaid excise tax, and any related interest and/or penalties owed to the Internal Revenue Service.  This reimbursement for the Gross-Up Payment increase shall be made in no event later than the end of the Executive's taxable year next following the Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.
Subsequent Recalculation

Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall constitute a material breach of the Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to terminate the Executive's employment with Good Reason immediately prior to or at any time after such succession.  Any successor to the Company shall be deemed to be the Company for all purposes of this Agreement.
