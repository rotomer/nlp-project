Jefferson Island Storage & Hub, LLC (Jefferson Island), a subsidiary of AGL Resources Inc., today served discovery requests on the State of Louisiana and intends to seek a trial date in its pending lawsuit over its natural gas storage expansion project at Lake Peigneur.  The storage expansion project would add two salt dome storage caverns under Lake Peigneur to the two caverns currently owned and operated by Jefferson Island.  Jefferson Island originally filed the suit against the State in the 19 Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge in September 2006, after the State informed Jefferson Island that its mineral lease, which authorizes salt extraction to create the two new storage caverns, had terminated.
th
Jefferson Island also asserted additional claims against the State seeking to obtain a declaratory ruling that Jefferson Islands surface lease, under which it operates its existing two storage caverns, authorizes the creation of the two new expansion caverns, separate and apart from the mineral lease challenged by the State.
Jefferson Island is an intrastate natural gas storage facility that serves Louisiana production companies, pipelines, distribution companies, manufacturers, businesses and industries.
