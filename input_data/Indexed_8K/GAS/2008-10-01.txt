Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
See Item 2.03
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On September 30, 2008, AGL Resources Inc. (AGL Resources) and its wholly-owned subsidiary AGL Capital Corporation (AGL Capital) entered into a Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) among AGL Resources as guarantor, AGL Capital as borrower, Wachovia Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole lead bookrunner, the several lenders named in the Credit Agreement, and SunTrust Bank, NA, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, UFJ, Ltd., Calyon New York Branch, and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, as Co-Documentation Agents.
Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, AGL Capital may borrow up to $140 million from time to time on a revolving basis (with an option to increase the credit facility to $150 million, subject to the agreement by lenders who wish to participate in such facility increase), to be used for working capital, certain permitted acquisitions, letters of credit and general corporate purposes including commercial paper backstop and capital expenditures.  The Credit Agreement includes a $10 million subfacility for letters of credit.  AGL Capitals obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by AGL Resources.  The Credit Agreement matures on September 29, 2009.
At AGL Capitals option, interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be based on either the base rate or the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus, in either case, an applicable interest margin.  The base rate is the higher of (i) the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent and (ii) the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.5%.  The applicable interest margin varies from time to time based on AGL Capitals then current credit ratings for the long-term, non-credit enhanced senior unsecured debt of AGL Capital or, if no such ratings then exist for such debt of AGL Capital, the long-term non-credit enhanced senior unsecured debt of AGL Resources.
As of the closing, and based upon AGL Capitals current credit ratings, base rate borrowings, based on the prime rate, would bear interest at 5.00% per annum.  Thirty-Day LIBOR-based borrowings would bear interest at 4.37%.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, covenants and events of default for facilities of this type.  Upon an uncured event of default under the Credit Agreement, all amounts owing under the Credit Agreement, if any, depending on the nature of such event of default will  automatically, or may upon notice by the administrative agent or the requisite lenders thereunder, become immediately due and payable and the lenders may terminate their commitments.
AGL Resources has ongoing relationships with all of the lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement, for which AGL Resources has paid customary fees and expenses.  AGL Resources and its affiliates have also entered into hedging arrangements with certain lenders. Affiliates of certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement have acted as underwriters for issuances of AGL Resources equity securities and AGL Capitals debt securities.
The preceding summary of the material terms of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.  In the event of any discrepancy between the preceding summary and the text of the Credit Agreement, the text of the Credit Agreement shall control.

. Atlanta Gas Light Company (AGLC) is required to investigate possible environmental contamination at manufactured gas plants () and, if necessary, clean up any contamination. AGLC has been associated with ten MGP sites in Georgia and three in Florida. Based on investigations to date, cleanup has either already occurred or is likely at most of these sites.  As of June 30, 2006, the remediation program in Georgia was approximately 100% complete, with the exception of ground water conditions.  As reported in Holdings Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, the projected costs of the remaining remediation at these sites are estimated to be $25 million, with additional future costs for the Florida sites in the range of $7 million to $11 million.

MGP
 
 
:  In New Jersey, Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc. (f/k/a NUI Utilities, Inc.) () . the utility subsidiary of NUI Corporation () owns five properties where former MGPs were operated.  A sixth MGP site, formerly operated by Elizabethtown Gas, a division of PUHI, operating in New Jersey (), is now owned by a church.

ETG
 
 
Five of the six sites in New Jersey are under a Memorandum Agreement (MOA), and the sixth site is subject to an Administration Consent Order (ACO) with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP).  The MOAs and ACO require PUHI to investigate on-site contamination, and if required by the NJDEP, investigate off-site impacts as well.  Various investigation and cleanup investigations have been conducted and are progressing slowly, but cleanups are likely at most sites.  Based upon our review of these sites to date, the likely estimated cost range to address the New Jersey MGP sites is $61 million to $119 million. These cost ranges are estimates.   
 
 
ETGs prudently incurred remediation costs for the New Jersey properties have been authorized by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to be recoverable in rates through ETGs Remediation Adjustment Clause.  As a result, ETG has recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $63 million, inclusive of interest, as a regulatory asset, reflecting both recorded future costs and accrued interest.  PUHI has also recovered a portion of MGP remediation costs incurred in New Jersey from the company's insurance carriers.
 
Outside of New Jersey, NUI Corporation owns, or previously owned, ten properties located in the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland on which MGPs were operated by NUI or by other parties in the past.  Two sites (Athens, Pennsylvania; Reidsville, North Carolina) have been sold to third parties, who have agreed to indemnify NUI against environmental liabilities.
Other States.
Of these ten sites, only one site (Elizabeth City, North Carolina) has had any regulatory activity over the past ten years.  The Elizabeth City site is subject to an Administrative Consent Order with the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NCDENR), dated October 31, 2001, and under such order, the Company has been directly by the NCDENR to enter the formal site investigation stage.
Currently, there is only limited information available to assess the potential environmental liability associated with these non-New Jersey sites, and the liability for these sites will remain an uncertainty until a more vigorous environmental assessment is performed.  Regarding the Elizabeth City site, experience at other similar sites suggests that the costs for remediation of this site will likely range from $10 to $20 million. There is one other site in North Carolina where investigation and remediation is probable, although no regulatory order exists and there is not currently any basis to reasonably estimate the costs of such actions. For the remaining sites, no basis for liability has been asserted. 
 
: Although the actual total cost of future environmental investigation and remediation efforts cannot be reasonably estimated, we have recorded on an undiscounted basis a total reserve of approximately $70 million, which we believe represents the probable minimum amount we may expend over the next 30 years. Of this reserve, approximately $61 million relates to remediation of the New Jersey MGP properties and approximately $9 million relates to remediation of the MGP properties located outside the state of New Jersey.

On January 8, 1998, the Georgia Public Service Commission () issued procedures and set a schedule for hearings regarding alleged pipeline safety violations.  On July 21, 1998, the GPSC approved a settlement between AGLC and the staff of the GPSC that details a 10-year pipeline replacement program () for approximately 2,300 miles of cast iron and bare steel pipe.  October 1, 2004 marked the beginning of the seventh year of the original 10-year PRP.

PRP
 
 
On June 10, 2005, AGLC and the GPSC entered into a Settlement Agreement that, among other things, extends AGLCs PRP by five years to require that all replacements be completed by December 2013, with the timing of such replacements to be subsequently determined through discussions with GPSC staff. Under the Settlement Agreement, rates charged to customers will remain unchanged through April 30, 2010, but AGLC will recognize reduced base rate revenues of $5 million on an annual basis through April 30, 2010. The five-year total reduction in recognized base rate revenues of $25 million will be applied to the amount of costs incurred to replace pipe and subsequently recovered from customers.
