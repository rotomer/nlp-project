With your consent, our opinion is qualified in all respects by the scope of such document examination.
Documents
In connection with the foregoing examination of such Documents, we have assumed (a) the genuineness of the signatures of persons signing all records, certificates, documents and instruments on behalf of parties other than the Guarantor; (b) the authenticity of the original of each record, certificate, Document and instrument submitted to and reviewed by us, and the conformity to the authentic original of all records, certificates, documents and instruments submitted to us as copies; (c) the due existence, status, power and authorization of, and execution and delivery by, the parties signing such Documents other than the Guarantor; (d) that such Documents are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto, other than the Borrower and the Guarantor, enforceable against such parties (other than the Borrower and the Guara ntor) in accordance with their respective terms; (e) that the statements of fact made in such Documents are true, accurate and complete; (f) that the parties to the Loan Documents other than the Borrower and the Guarantor are in full compliance with the terms of the Loan Documents; (g) that any action taken by the parties to the Loan Documents other than the Borrower and the Guarantor in connection with the performance or enforcement of the Loan Documents will be lawful, commercially reasonable and taken in good faith and that the parties to the Loan Documents other than the Borrower and the Guarantor will seek to enforce their rights only in circumstances and in a manner in which it is equitable and commercially reasonable to do so and otherwise in accordance with applicable law; (h) that there has been no mutual mistake of fact and there exists no fraud or duress; (i) that the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents comply with any test of good faith, fairness or conscionability required by law; (j ) that the parties to the Loan Documents other than the Borrower and the Guarantor are entering into the transaction without notice of any defense against the enforcement of any rights created by, or adverse claim to any security interest transferred as part of, the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents; (k) that all natural persons signing a Loan Document have sufficient legal capacity to do so; (l) that routine procedural matters, such as service of process or qualification to do business in the jurisdiction, will be satisfied by the party seeking to enforce a Loan Document; and (m) that neither the Borrower nor the Guarantor will take any discretionary action permitted or facilitated by the Loan Documents that in the future would result in a violation of law or constitute a breach or default under any other agreement or court order to which the Borrower or the Guarantor is a party.  As to questions of fact material to the opinions expressed below, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certificates of the Borrower and the Guarantor or their respective officers or of public officials.
 
 
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject to the further qualifications set forth herein, it is our opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We hereby confirm, to our knowledge, there is no federal, New York or Georgia litigation at law or in equity or any proceeding before any federal, New York or Georgia governmental agency involving the Borrower or the Guarantor, pending or overtly threatened by a written notice (i) with respect to the Loan Documents, or (ii) in which any judgment or order might reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
 
 
 
The phrase to our knowledge when used in the opinions herein expressed with respect to the existence or absence of certain matters is based upon the conscious awareness of facts or other information by the undersigned partner and by other lawyers in this firm who have had active involvement in negotiating the transactions contemplated by this opinion letter and does not include knowledge that might be obtained by review of this firms files.  We have not, except as otherwise set forth herein, undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence of those matters, and no inference as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of those matters should be drawn from our representation of the Loan Parties.
 
We express no opinion herein in any respect as to (i) federal and state securities laws and regulations, (ii) pension and employee benefit laws and regulations, including without limitation the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, (iii) federal and state environmental laws and regulations, (iv) federal and state land use and subdivision laws and regulations (including without limitation any applicable building or zoning, fire, health, safety or public service company laws, ordinances or regulations), (v) the statutes and ordinances, administrative decisions, and the rules and regulations of counties, towns, municipalities and special political subdivisions (whether created or enabled through legislative action at the federal, state or regional level), and judicial decisions to the extent that they deal with any of the foregoing, (vi) federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws and regulations, (vii) federal and state laws and regulations concerning filing and notice requirements (e.g. Hart-Scott-Rodino and Exon-Florio) other than requirements applicable to charter-related documents such as certificates of merger, (viii) compliance with fiduciary duty requirements, (ix) fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws, (x) federal and state laws and regulations concerning the characterization of a transaction as one involving the creation of a lien on real property or a security interest in personal property, the characterization of a contract as one in a form sufficient to create a lien or a security interest, and the creation, attachment, priority or enforcement of a lien on real property or security interest in personal property, (xi) the perfection of a security interest in personal property, (xii) federal and state patent, copyright, intellectual property, trademark and trade name laws, (xiii) fed eral and state labor laws and regulations, (xiv) state tax laws and regulations, (xv) federal tax laws and regulations, (xvi) federal and state health and safety laws and regulations, (xvii) federal and state racketeering laws and regulations, (xviii) federal and state laws, regulations and policies concerning (a) national and local emergency, (b) judicial deference to acts of sovereign states, and (c) criminal and civil forfeiture laws, (xix) except as expressly provided in opinion paragraphs 7 and 8 above, federal and state banking laws and regulations, and (xx) other federal and state statutes of general application to the extent they provide for criminal prosecution.
 
The opinions expressed herein are limited and qualified in all respects by the effects of general principles of equity, whether applied by a court of law or equity, and by the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, receivership, and other laws now or hereafter in force affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally (not just creditors of specific types of debtors) and other laws now or hereafter in force affecting generally only creditors of specific types of debtors.  We express no opinion regarding the availability of equitable remedies under any of the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the enforceability or recognition under the laws of New York of (i) waiver o f the right to a jury trial, (ii) self-help, subrogation, indemnity, severability or the exercise of private power of sale, (iii) confession of judgment, (iv) provisions which purport to establish evidentiary standards, (v) provisions related to waiver of remedies (or the delay or omission of enforcement thereof), disclaimers, liability limitations with respect to third parties, releases or waivers of legal or equitable rights, discharge or waivers of defenses or liquidated damages, (vi) provisions related to choice of governing laws, which may be qualified by judicial decisions, or (vii) any power of attorney or similar appointment under any of the Loan Documents.
 
 
 
 
The opinions expressed herein are further limited and qualified in all respects by the effect of generally applicable rules of law that: (i) limit or affect the enforcement of provisions of a contract that purport to require waiver of the obligations of good faith, fair dealing, reasonableness and diligence, (ii) provide that forum selection clauses may not be binding, (iii) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been selected, (iv) limit the right of a creditor to use force or cause a breach of the peace in the enforcement of rights, (v) relate to the sale or disposition of collateral or the requirements of a commercially reasonable sale, (vi) limit the enforceability of provisions releasing, exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct, (vii) may, where less than all of a contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange, (viii) govern and afford judicial discretion regarding the determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys fees and other costs, (ix) may, in the absence of a waiver or consent, discharge a guarantor to the extent that (a) action by a creditor impairs the value of collateral securing guaranteed debt to the detriment of the guarantor, or (b) guaranteed debt is materially modified, and (x) may permit a party who has materially failed to render or offer performance required by a contract to cure that failure unless (a) permitting a cure would unreasonably hinder making substitute arrangements for performance, or (b) it was important in the circumsta nces to the aggrieved party that performance occur by the date stated in the contract.
 
In connection with the opinions expressed herein, we are assuming that the Loan Documents do not, and are not intended to, confer upon the Administrative Agent any lien or security interest in any leases, contracts or agreements which by their terms require the consent of the other parties thereto prior to any assignment, mortgage or encumbrance thereof or which would preclude any such assignment, mortgage or encumbrance without first obtaining such other partys consent.  We express no opinion regarding the perfection of any security interest granted under the Loan Documents.
 
We express no opinion with respect to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of New York, the laws of the State of Georgia and, solely with respect to opinion paragraphs 7 and 8 above, the federal laws of the United States.
 
This opinion is limited to the specific issues addressed herein and the opinions rendered above are limited in all respects to laws and facts existing on the date and at the time hereof. Our opinions are set forth as of the date of this letter upon the assumptions set forth herein and we disclaim any obligation or responsibility to update or supplement this letter in response to subsequent changes in the law or future events affecting the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. By rendering this opinion, we do not undertake to advise you with respect to any other matter or any change in such laws, facts or in the interpretations thereof which may occur after the date or time hereof.  This opinion is delivered to you in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, and it may not be furnished to or relied upon by any other person or used, circulated or quoted for any other purpose without our express written consent, provided, however, that permitted assignees of any Lenders under the Credit Agreement may rely upon this opinion letter as of this opinion letter were addressed to them on the date hereof.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special Nevada counsel to AGL Capital Corporation, a Nevada corporation (AGL Capital) in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and the extensions of credit to be made thereunder to AGL Capital pursuant to the Credit Agreement.  AGL Capital is a wholly-owned financing subsidiary of the AGL Resources Inc., a Georgia corporation (Guarantor).  The Loans, Reimbursement Obligations, and other Obligations as defined and described in the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by a Guarantee Agreement (the "Guarantee Agreement"), by Guarantor dated as of September 30, 2008 in favor of Administrative Agent for the Lenders.
We are delivering this opinion at the request of the AGL Capital to satisfy the condition imposed by Section 5.1(d) of the Credit Agreement.  Capitalized terms used herein without definition are used as defined in the Credit Agreement.
 
 
 
In the capacity described above, we have examined copies of the following documents only:
(a)           the Credit Agreement;
 
(b)           the Guarantee Agreement;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed that each of the parties to the Credit Agreement has duly and validly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement, and such other documents to be executed in connection with the Credit Agreement to which each such party is a signatory.  We have assumed that each person, other than AGL Capital, executing the Credit Agreement is authorized to do so.  We have assumed each natural person executing the Credit Agreement is legally competent to do so, and that all signatures on the documents are genuine.  We have assumed all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, all documents submitted to us as copies conform to the original documents and all public records reviewed are accurate and complete .
 
 
 
 
Based on the foregoing, it is our opinion that, under Nevada law:
 
 
 
 
 
 
We express no opinion except as the laws of the State of Nevada, excluding any Blue Sky laws.  Our opinions are set forth as of the date of this letter upon the assumptions set forth herein and we disclaim any obligation or responsibility to update or supplement this letter in response to subsequent changes in the law or future events affecting the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement.  The phrase our actual knowledge as set forth at opinions 4 and 5 above means the opinions are based solely on the actual and current factual knowledge of John P. Fowler who participated in the preparation of this opinion and on the Certificate of Officer of the AGL Capital attached to this letter.  The term our actual knowledge& #8221; does not imply that we made any examination of this firms or other persons files or that any inquiry was made of the client, any lawyer or any other person or of any public records except a review of the documents described herein and the Certificate of Officer attached hereto.
 
 
 
 
Without our prior consent, the opinions in this letter may not be relied upon by anyone other than the addressees hereof and any actual or prospective transferees or new lenders pursuant to the provisions of the Credit Agreement, or referred to or quoted in whole or in part in any report or document furnished to any person or entity.
