Following the proposed merger of AGL Resources Inc. (AGL) with Nicor Inc. (the Merger), AGL will assume Nicors 401(k) plans (the Nicor 401(k) Plans).  In connection with the Merger, all Nicor common stock in the Nicor 401(k) Plans will be converted into shares of AGL common stock and cash.  While the trustee of the Nicor 401(k) Plans is taking the steps necessary to process and implement this conversion of shares, the participants in the Nicor 401(k) Plans will be unable to direct or diversify investments in or out of the Nicor/ common stock fund, which constitutes a blackout period for the Nicor 401(k) Plans (the 401(k) Plan blackout period).

The 401(k) Plan blackout period may last for more than three business days, and it is expected that the number of participants in the Nicor 401(k) Plans will constitute more than 50% of the total number of participants in all such plans sponsored by AGL following completion of the proposed merger.  Accordingly, pursuant to Regulation BTR, a corresponding blackout period will be imposed on all of AGLs directors and executive officers with respect to equity securities acquired in connection with their service to AGL.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
This notice is to inform you of significant restrictions on your ability to deal in AGL common stock and derivative securities, such as stock options, during an upcoming special blackout period.  These restrictions are imposed on all directors and executive officers of AGL by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation BTR (Blackout Trading Restriction).  As more fully described below, during this blackout period, you will be prohibited from engaging in transactions involving AGL equity securities (including shares of AGL common stock, stock options and other derivatives) that you acquired in connection with your service as a director or an executive officer. We will notify you of any changes that affect the blackout period.
The rules summarized above are complex, and the civil and criminal penalties that could be imposed upon directors and executive officers who violate them could be severe. Please contact Paul Shlanta at (404) 584-3430 before engaging in any transaction involving AGL securities during the 401(k) Plan blackout period, or if you believe that any such transaction in which you have a pecuniary interest may occur during the 401(k) Plan blackout period.
