Item 1.01.                 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 10, 2011, AGL Resources Inc., a Georgia corporation (), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, AGL Capital Corporation, a Nevada corporation (), entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the ) among AGL Resources, as guarantor, AGL Capital, as borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (), as administrative agent (the ) and issuing lender, SunTrust Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co-syndication agents, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as issuing lender, Bank of America, N.A. and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as co-documentation agents, and the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto.  The Credit Agreement amends and restates in its entirety, the credit agreement dated September 15, 2010 (as amended, the ), among AGL Resources, as guarantor thereunder, AGL Capital, as borrower thereunder, Wells, as administrative agent thereunder and certain other agents and lenders party thereto.  AGL Capitals obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by AGL Resources pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement, dated as of November 10, 2011, made by AGL Resources, as guarantor, in favor of the Administrative Agent for the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the Credit Agreement (the ).
AGL Resources
AGL Capital
Credit Agreement
Wells
Administrative Agent
Existing Credit Agreement
Guarantee Agreement
Among other things, the Credit Agreement amends and restates the Existing Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Existing Credit Agreement and to increase the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement.
Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, AGL Capital may borrow up to $1.3 billion from time to time on a revolving basis, which, subject to certain restrictions, can be used for working capital purposes, capital expenditures, certain permitted acquisitions, stock repurchases, the issuance of letters of credit and other general corporate purposes.  The Credit Agreement includes a $250 million sub-facility for letters of credit, and has an accordion provision whereby AGL Capital can request that the total amount it can borrow be increased to up to $1.8 billion (subject to the acceptance by existing or new lenders of additional commitments).  The Credit Agreement matures on November 10, 2016 (subject to adjustment pursuant to the Credit Agreement).
At AGL Capitals option, interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be based on either the base rate or the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus, in either case, an applicable interest margin.  The base rate is the highest of (i) the prime commercial lending rate of Wells Fargo Bank, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus  of 1%, and (iii) the one-month LIBOR plus 1%.  The applicable interest margin varies from time to time based on AGL Capitals then current credit ratings for the long-term, non-credit enhanced senior unsecured debt securities of AGL Capital (or, if there is no such debt outstanding, AGL Capitals issuer rating then in effect) or, if no such ratings then exist for such debt of AGL Capital, the long-term non-credit enhanced senior unsecured debt securities of AGL Resources.
As of the closing, and based upon AGL Capitals current credit ratings, base rate borrowings, based on the prime rate, would bear interest at 3.50% per annum.  One-month LIBOR-based borrowings would bear interest at 1.50%.
Under the Credit Agreement, AGL Resources must have on a consolidated basis, a total debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.70:1.00, as of the end of any fiscal month or at the end of any fiscal quarter.  The Credit Agreement also contains certain other covenants that, among other things, restrict liens and encumbrances, mergers and consolidations, asset dispositions, dividends and other restricted payments, loans and investments and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary representations, affirmative covenants and events of default for facilities of this type.  Upon an uncured event of default under the Credit Agreement, all amounts owing under the Credit Agreement, if any, depending on the nature of such event of default will  automatically, or may upon notice by the Administrative Agent or the requisite lenders thereunder, become immediately due and payable and the lenders may terminate their commitments.
AGL Resources has had prior business relationships with most of the agents and lenders or their affiliates that are parties to the Credit Agreement, for which AGL Resources has paid customary fees and expenses.  AGL Resources and its affiliates have also entered into hedging arrangements with certain lenders.  Affiliates of certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement have acted as underwriters for issuances of securities of AGL Resources and AGL Capital.
The foregoing summary of the material terms of the Credit Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Credit Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement, which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.  In the event of any discrepancy between the foregoing summary and the text of the agreements, the text of the agreements shall control.

For the avoidance of doubt, if only one of Moodys or S&P has issued a rating with respect to the Borrowers senior unsecured long-term debt securities without third-party credit enhancement, then the Status Level shall be determined based solely on such rating.

the Administrative Agent shall have determined in its reasonable and good faith judgment (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or
 
(ii)
 
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the actual cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period;
 
the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter.  If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans.  Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders in the case of clause (ii) above), no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to Eurodollar Loans.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly withdraw such notice when Eurodollar Loans are again available.

If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans, on demand, from the Borrower.

.  Atlanta Gas Light Company () is required to investigate possible environmental contamination at manufactured gas plants () and, if necessary, clean up any contamination. AGLC has been associated with ten MGP sites in Georgia and three in Florida. Based on investigations to date, cleanup has either already occurred or is likely at most of these sites.  As of June 30, 2010, the remediation program in Georgia was approximately 100% complete, ground water remediation continues.  As reported in Holdings Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2011, the projected costs of the remaining remediation at these sites are estimated to be $39-101 million.

One new former MGP site has been recently identified adjacent to an existing MGP remediation site.
except for a few remaining areas of recently discovered impact, although
Investigation is concluded for one phase of the Orlando, Florida site; however, the Environmental Protection Agency has not approved the clean up plans. For elements of the Georgia and Florida sites where we still cannot provide engineering cost estimates, considerable variability remains in future cost estimates.
 
.  In New Jersey, Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc. (f/k/a NUI Utilities, Inc.) () owns five properties where former MGPs were operated.  A sixth MGP site, formerly operated by Elizabethtown Gas, a division of PUHI, operating in New Jersey (), is now owned by a church.  Various investigation and cleanup investigations have been conducted and are progressing slowly, but cleanups are likely at most sites.  Because As reported in Holdings Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2011, the projected costs of the remaining remediation at these sites are estimated to be $124-175 million.

PUHI is currently conducting remediation activities with oversight from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

.  Outside of New Jersey, subsidiary NUI Corporation owns, or previously owned, ten properties located in the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland on which MGPs were operated by NUI or by other parties in the past.  Two sites (Athens, Pennsylvania; Reidsville, North Carolina) have been sold to third parties, who have agreed to indemnify NUI against environmental liabilities.
Other States
 
Of these ten sites, only one site (Elizabeth City, North Carolina) has had any regulatory activity over the past ten years.  The Elizabeth City site is subject to an Administrative Consent Order with the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (), dated October 31, 2001, and under such order, the Company has entered the formal site investigation stage.
NCDENR
 
Currently, there is only limited information available to assess the potential environmental liability associated with these non-New Jersey sites, and the liability for these sites will remain an uncertainty until a more vigorous environmental assessment is performed.  As reported in Holdings Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30 2011, the projected costs of the remediation at the Elizabeth City site is estimated to be $11-16 million.
