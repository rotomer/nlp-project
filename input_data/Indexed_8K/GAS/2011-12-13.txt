.  Class A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
:  Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any class or series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation (the "Preferred Stock") ranking prior and superior to the Class A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of the Class A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock and of any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Class A Preferred Stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly, dividends payable in cash on the last day of January, April, July, and October in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Class A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) One Dollar ($1.00) or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Class A Preferred Stock.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Class A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(1)  Dividends
:  The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Class A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (1) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock) provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of One Dollar ($1.00) per share on the Class A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable, when, as and if declared, on such subsequent Dividend Payment Date.

Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of Class A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Class A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

(b)  Except as otherwise provided herein, in this Article or in any Articles of Amendment of the Articles of Incorporation creating a class or series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, and except as otherwise provided by law, the holders of shares of Class A Preferred Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Corporation.
(c)  Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Class A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

(iv)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Class A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Class A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(b)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration, any shares of stock of the Corporation, unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (a) of this Section 2.03(5), purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.

(7)  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
:  In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination, share exchange or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are converted into, exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Class A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly converted into, exchanged for or changed into an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is converted or exchanged.

(b)  an amount equal to the highest price/earnings multiple of the Corporation, as customarily computed and reported in the financial community, attained by the Corporation during the five fiscal years immediately preceding the Date of Determination multiplied by the aggregate amount, if any, by which 10% of such higher per share price determined under (a) above exceeds the smallest quarterly common stock dividend per share (annualized) paid in cash since the date on which such Related Person became a Related Person.

(8)  After such Related Person has become a Related Person, such Related Person shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a shareholder of the Corporation) of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages provided by the Corporation, whether in anticipation of or in connection with such Business Combination or otherwise.

If an annual or special shareholders' meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice of the new date, time, or place need not be given if the new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment.  However, if a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed under Section 1.9 herein, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.

The list shall be arranged by voting group (and within each voting group by class or series of shares) and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder.

Whenever a class of shares or series of shares is entitled to vote as a separate voting group on a matter, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group so entitled shall constitute a quorum for purposes of action on any matter requiring such separate voting.  Once a share is represented, either in person or by proxy, for any purpose at a meeting other than solely to object to holding a meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is set for the adjourned meeting.
SECTION 1.8.
Quorum
.
                                  The holders of a majority of the voting shares represented at a meeting, or the Chairman of the Board or the President, whether or not a quorum is present, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  If after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting.
SECTION 1.9.
Adjournment of Meetings
.
                                  When a quorum exists, action on a matter (other than the election of Directors) by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation, a bylaw authorized by the Articles of Incorporation or express provision of law requires a greater number of affirmative votes.  Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present.  Shareholders do not have the right to cumulate their votes unless the Articles of Incorporation so provide.
SECTION 1.10.

A shareholder may vote his or her shares in person or by proxy.  A shareholder or his or her agent or attorney in fact may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment form or by an electronic transmission that is suitable for the retention, retrieval and reproduction of information by the recipient.  An electronic transmission must contain or be accompanied by information from which it can be determined that the shareholder, the shareholder's agent or the shareholder's attorney in fact authorized the electronic transmission.  An appointment of proxy is effective when received by the Corporate Secretary of the Company or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes and is valid for eleven (11) months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment.  An appointment of proxy is revocable by the shareholder unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest.  Any copy, facsimile transmission or other reliable reproduction of the appointment form or electronic transmission may be substituted or used in lieu of the original appointment form or electronic transmission for any and all purposes for which the original appointment form or electronic transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile transmission or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original appointment form or electronic transmission.

                                  The Board of Directors shall consist of at least five (5) members and not more than sixteen (16) members, the exact number of Directors to be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company.  No decrease in the number or minimum number of Directors, through amendment of the Articles of Incorporation or of these Bylaws or otherwise, shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent Director.  All directors elected at the annual meeting of shareholders shall be elected for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders. Each director who is elected a director, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which he or she was elected, and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, removal or disqualification from office. During the intervals between annual meetings of shareholders, any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors caused by resignation, removal, death or other incapacity, and any newly created Directorships resulting from an increase in the number of Directors, shall be filled by a majority vote of the Directors then in office, whether or not a quorum.  Directors may be elected by shareholders only at an annual meeting of shareholders.  Each Director chosen to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.

SECTION 2.3.
Qualifications of Directors
.
                                .  In the case of an election for Directors where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of Directors to be elected, if a nominee for Director does not receive the vote of at least the Majority of Votes Cast, the Director will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors following certification of the shareholder vote.  For purposes of this Bylaw provision, a Majority of Votes Cast means that, at a meeting for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, the number of shares voted for a Directors election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that Directors election.  Votes cast include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that Directors election.
SECTION 2.3.1.
Vote Required in Uncontested Elections
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken.  The Board of Directors will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant including, without limitation, the stated reasons why shareholders withheld votes for election of such Director, the length of service and qualifications of the Director whose resignation has been tendered, the Directors contributions to the Company and the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines.  The Director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation.  If such Directors resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors such Director shall continue to serve until his or her successor is duly elected or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.  If a majority of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not receive a Majority of Votes Cast, then the independent Directors who did not fail to receive a Majority of Votes Cast, shall appoint a committee amongst themselves to consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept them.  If the only Directors who did not fail to receive a Majority of Votes Cast, constitute three or fewer Directors, all Directors may participate in the action regarding whether to accept the resignation offers.

If a Directors resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors, then any resulting vacancy may be filled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.4 of these Bylaws or the Board of Directors may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2 of these Bylaws.
This Bylaw provision will be summarized or included in each proxy statement relating to an election of Directors of the Company.
This Section 2.3.1 shall not apply in the case of an election for Directors where the number of nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected.
                                .  If any Director ceases to hold the position in such Director's principal employment profession, trade or calling that such Director held at the beginning of the current term for which such Director was elected a Director, such person shall not be eligible for re-election to the Board of Directors after the expiration of such current term unless the Board of Directors decides that such person should be eligible for re-election.

                                  The rights to indemnification and advance of expenses granted in the Articles of Incorporation and in these Bylaws are not exclusive, and do not limit the Company's power to pay or reimburse expenses to which a Director may be entitled, whether by agreement, vote of shareholders or Disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office, and do not limit the Company's power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a Director in connection with his appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when he is not a party.

Unless otherwise required or permitted by law, such notice shall be deemed to be effective at the earliest of when received, or when delivered, properly addressed, to the addressee's last known principal place of business or residence; or, except as provided in the immediate next sentence, five days after the same shall be deposited in the United States mail if mailed with first-class postage prepaid and correctly addressed; or on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, and the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the addressee.  Written notice to the Company's shareholders, if in comprehensible form, is effective when mailed, if mailed with first-class postage prepaid and correctly addressed to the shareholder's address shown in the Company's current record of shareholders; provided, however, that if the Company has more than 500 shareholders of record entitled to vote at a meeting, it may utilize a class of mail other than first class if the notice of meeting is mailed, with adequate postage prepaid, not less than 30 days before the date of the meeting.  Notice to any Director or shareholder may also be oral if oral notice is reasonable under the circumstances.  Oral notice is effective when communicated if communicated in a comprehensible manner.

Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting and of all objections to the place or time of the meeting or the manner in which it has been called or convened, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of stating, at the beginning of the meeting, any such objection and, in the case of a Director, does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.  Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the shareholders, Directors or a committee of Directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice; provided, however, that any waiver of notice of a meeting of shareholders required with respect to an amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, a plan of merger or share exchange, a plan of consolidation, a sale of assets or any other action which would entitle the shareholder to dissent pursuant to Section 14-2-1302 of the Code and obtain payment for his shares shall be effective only upon compliance with Section 14-2-706(c) of the Code or successor provisions.

When authorizing the issue of a new certificate, the Board of Directors may require such proof of loss as it may deem appropriate as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, including a requirement that the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or the owner's legal representative, advertise the same in such manner as the Board shall require and/or that the owner give the Company a bond in such sum as the Board may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Company with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Exhibit 99.2
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Nicor Inc.
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nicor Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, common equity, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule at Item 15(a)(2).  We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
 
 
 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT (concluded)
REGISTERED
 PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.  Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.  Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.  However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.  Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company.
Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal ControlIntegrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting.  Management has concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.  Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the companys internal control over financial reporting.
There has been no change in the companys internal controls over financial reporting during the companys most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Certain terms used herein are defined in the glossary on pages ii and iii.
In December 2010, Nicor entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with AGL Resources, a copy of which was filed with the SEC.  In accordance with the Merger Agreement, each share of Nicor stock, other than shares to be cancelled and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive consideration consisting of (i) $21.20 in cash and (ii) 0.8382 shares of AGL Resources common stock, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances.
Completion of the proposed merger is conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval by both companies, the SECs clearance of a registration statement registering AGL Resources common stock, expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act and regulatory approval by the ICC.
The Merger Agreement provides certain termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources, and provides for the payment of fees and expenses upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances. Nicor currently anticipates the merger will be completed in the second half of 2011.  Although the company believes that Nicor and AGL Resources will receive the required authorizations, approvals and consents to complete the proposed merger, there can be no assurance as to the timing of these authorizations, approvals and consents or as to the ultimate ability to obtain such authorizations, consents or approvals (or any additional authorizations, approvals or consents which may otherwise become necessary) or that such authorizations, approvals or consents will be obtained on terms and subject to conditions satisfactory to Nicor and AGL Resources.
For additional information concerning the proposed merger, please see Nicors Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 7, 2010 and the Form S-4 registration statement filed with the SEC by AGL Resources on February 4, 2011.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, the company has incurred and expensed $4.6 million of merger-related costs.  No other adjustments have been made to the financial statements as a result of the proposed merger.
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nicor and all majority-owned subsidiaries.  Nicors key subsidiaries are described in Note 14  Business Segment and Geographic Information.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Consolidation.
  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates that affect reported amounts.  Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material.  Accounting estimates requiring significant management judgment involve accrued unbilled revenues, derivative instruments, regulatory assets and liabilities, pension and other postretirement benefits, potential asset impairments, asset retirement obligations, loss contingencies including environmental contingencies, credit risk and income taxes.
Use of estimates.
The companys management evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the date the financial statements were issued.
Subsequent events.  
 
 
 
  Cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments of domestic subsidiaries with an initial maturity of three months or less.  The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents.
  Nicor Gas is regulated by the ICC, which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in Illinois.  As a rate-regulated company, Nicor Gas is required to recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and, accordingly, has recorded regulatory assets and liabilities.  Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through rate riders or base rates, upon approval by the ICC.  Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues collected from ratepayers through a rate rider or base rates, or probable future expenditures.  If Nicor Gas operations become no longer subject to rate regulation, a write-off of net regulatory liabilities would be required.
Regulatory assets and liabilities.
The company had regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31 as follows (in millions):
All items listed above are classified in Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the exception of the noncurrent portion of the Regulatory asset retirement liability, which is stated separately.
The ICC does not presently allow Nicor Gas the opportunity to earn a return on its regulatory postretirement asset.  The regulatory postretirement asset is expected to be recovered from ratepayers over a period of approximately 9 to 12 years.  The regulatory assets related to debt are not included in rate base, but are recovered over the term of the debt through the rate of return authorized by the ICC.  Nicor Gas is allowed to recover and is required to pay, using short-term interest rates, the carrying costs related to temporary under or overcollections of natural gas costs, certain environmental costs and energy efficiency costs charged to its customers.  However, there is no interest associated with the under or overcollections of bad debt expense.
The companys investments in marketable securities are categorized at the date of acquisition as trading, held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale.  Trading securities, which include money market funds, are carried at fair value and are classified as current assets unless held to satisfy a long-term
Investments.  
obligation.  The company classifies money market funds held by its non-U.S. subsidiaries as short-term investments and all others are classified as cash equivalents.  Debt securities are categorized as held-to-maturity when the company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.  Held-to-maturity securities are included in either short-term or long-term investments based upon their contractual maturity date.  The company carries held-to-maturity securities at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in common equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  Available-for-sale securities are classified as noncurrent assets unless the intent is to sell the security within 12 months.  The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities.
Investments in equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the equity method are carried at cost.
 
 
 
  The company invests in partnerships and limited liability companies that are accounted for under the equity method.  Related investment balances classified as long-term investments at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $93.8 million and $99.6 million, respectively, and include $76.0 million and $84.8 million, respectively, related to Triton.
Equity method investments.
  Goodwill is the excess cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.  Tropical Shipping had goodwill of $22.5 million and $20.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The increase in goodwill from 2009 to 2010 is due primarily to the acquisition of the assets of V.I. Cargo Services, Inc., a provider of less-than-container load and full container load consolidation services from the United States to the island of St. Croix (in the U.S. Virgin Islands).  Nicor Services had goodwill of $4.0 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.  Intangible assets other than goodwill with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and totaled $5.1 million and $2.6 million, net of accumulated amortization, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  These intangible assets consisted primarily of customer and agency relationships at Tropical Shipping.  At December 31, 2010, intangible assets also included rights that were obtained by Central Valley related to the storage facility development.  Goodwill and other intangible assets are classified in noncurrent other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Goodwill and other intangible assets.
  The company records legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets in the period in which the obligation is incurred, if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation.  When an asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability, a corresponding amount is recorded as an asset retirement cost (an additional cost of the long-lived asset).  Subsequently, the asset retirement obligation is accreted to the expected settlement amount and the asset retirement cost is depreciated over the life of the asset on a straight-line basis.
Asset retirement obligations.
Subject to rate regulation, Nicor Gas continues to accrue all future asset retirement costs through depreciation over the lives of its assets even when a legal retirement obligation does not exist or insufficient information exists to determine the fair value of the obligation.  Amounts charged to depreciation by Nicor Gas for future retirement costs, in excess of the normal depreciation and accretion described above, are classified as a regulatory asset retirement liability.
Derivative instruments.
 
Cash flows from derivative instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, in the same categories as the underlying transactions.
Cash flow hedge accounting may be elected only for highly effective hedges, based upon an assessment, performed at least quarterly, of the historical and probable future correlation of cash flows from the derivative instrument to changes in the expected future cash flows of the hedged item.  To the extent cash flow hedge accounting is applied, the effective portion of any changes in the fair value of the derivative
instruments is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  Ineffectiveness, if any, is immediately recognized in operating income.  The amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to earnings when the forecasted transaction is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, even if the derivative instrument is sold, extinguished or terminated prior to the transaction occurring.  If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to operating income.
 
 
 
.  Derivative instruments, such as futures contracts, options and swap agreements, are utilized primarily in the purchase of natural gas for customers.  These derivative instruments are reflected at fair value and are not designated as hedges.  Realized gains or losses on such instruments are included in the cost of gas delivered and are passed directly through to customers, subject to ICC review, and therefore have no direct impact on earnings.  Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.
Nicor Gas
Nicor Gas enters into swap agreements to reduce the earnings volatility of certain forecasted operating costs arising from fluctuations in natural gas prices, such as the purchase of natural gas for use in company operations.  These derivative instruments are carried at fair value.  To the extent hedge accounting is not elected, changes in such fair values are immediately recorded in the current period as operating and maintenance expense.
.  Derivative instruments, such as futures contracts, options, forward contracts, swap agreements and other energy-related contracts are held by Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, Nicor Enerchange, for trading purposes.  Certain of these derivative instruments are used to economically hedge price risk associated with inventories of natural gas, fixed-price purchase and sale agreements and other future natural gas commitments.  Nicor Enerchange records such derivative instruments at fair value and generally cannot elect hedge accounting.  As a result, changes in derivative fair values may have a material impact on Nicors financial statements.
Nicor Enerchange
Other derivative instruments are used by Nicor Enerchange to hedge price risks related to the activities of affiliates.  Derivatives are held related to certain utility-bill management products sold to retail customers.  These derivative instruments are carried at fair value and cash flow hedge accounting may or may not be elected.  Other derivative instruments are held for the purpose of hedging the commodity price risk associated with the forecasted purchase of base gas that will be injected as part of the development of the natural gas storage facility by Central Valley.  Such derivative instruments are carried at fair value and cash flow hedge accounting has been elected on a consolidated basis.  The base gas is a component of the storage facilitys construction costs.  Therefore, amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these derivative instruments will not be reclassified to earnings until the storage facility is retired and the base gas is sold.
 Forward-starting interest rate swaps are utilized to hedge the interest payments associated with long-term debt.  These derivative instruments are carried at fair value and cash flow hedge accounting is elected.  The effective portion of any changes in the fair value of the derivatives is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Upon settlement, the deferred amount is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt.
Nicor.
  Nicors major subsidiaries have diversified customer bases and the company believes that it maintains prudent credit policies which mitigate customer receivable, supplier performance and derivative counterparty credit riskThe company is exposed to credit risk in the event a customer or supplier defaults on a contract to pay for or deliver product at agreed-upon terms and conditions, or a counterparty to a derivative instrument defaults on a settlement or otherwise fails to perform under contractual terms.  To manage this risk, the company has established procedures to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, to seek guarantees or collateral back-up in the form of cash or letters of credit, to acquire credit insurance in certain instances, and to limit its exposure to any one counterparty.  Nicor also, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to
Credit risk and concentrations.
.  
mitigate counterparty credit risk.  Fair value measurements consider credit risk.  For assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, credit losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.
 
 
 
On February 2, 2010, the ICC approved a bad debt rider that was filed for in 2009 by Nicor Gas.  The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense included in its rates for the respective year.
  Gas distribution revenues are recognized when natural gas is delivered to customers.  In accordance with ICC regulations and subject to its review, the cost of gas delivered is charged to customers without markup, although the timing of cost recovery can vary.  Temporary under and overcollections of gas costs are deferred or accrued as a regulatory asset or liability with a corresponding decrease or increase to cost of gas, respectively.
Revenue recognition.
Nicor Gas accrues revenues for estimated deliveries to customers from the date of their last bill until the balance sheet date.  Receivables include accrued unbilled revenues of $144.8 million and $141.0 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related primarily to gas distribution operations.
Nicor Gas classifies revenue taxes billed to customers as operating revenues and related taxes incurred as operating expenses.  Revenue taxes included in operating expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $145.9 million, $148.1 million and $171.1 million, respectively.
In the shipping business, revenues and related delivery costs are recognized at the time vessels depart from port.  While alternative methods of recognizing shipping revenue and related costs exist, the difference between those methods and the companys policy does not have a material impact on operating results.
Nicor Enerchange presents revenue from natural gas sales, cost of sales, and related derivative instruments, which are entered into for trading purposes, on a net basis.  For Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy, revenue is recognized on their 12-month utility-bill management contracts as the lesser of cumulative earned or cumulative billed amounts.  Nicor Services recognizes revenue for warranty and repair contracts on a straight-line basis over the contract term.  Revenue for maintenance services is recognized at the time such services are performed.
  Nicor records expense for repair and maintenance costs as incurred.  The shipping business uses the direct expensing method for planned major maintenance related to dry-docking and major repairs of its owned vessels.
Repair and maintenance expense.
  The company accrues estimated legal defense costs associated with loss contingencies in the period in which it determines that such costs are probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable.
Legal defense costs.
  Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.  The gas distribution business composite depreciation rate is 4.1 percent, which includes all estimated future retirement costs.  Upon the retirement of these assets, no gain or loss is recognized.  In the shipping business, the estimated useful lives of vessels range from 20 to 25 years.
Depreciation.
Deferred income taxes are provided at the current statutory income tax rate for temporary differences between the tax basis (adjusted for related unrecognized tax benefits, if any) of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements.  In the gas distribution business, investment tax credits and regulatory income tax liabilities for deferred taxes in excess of the current statutory rate are amortized to income as the temporary difference reverses.
Income taxes.  
 
 
 
A deferred income tax liability is not recorded on undistributed foreign earnings that are expected in managements judgment to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.  Management considers, among other factors, actual cash investments offshore as well as projected cash requirements in making this determination.  Changes in managements investment or repatriation plans or circumstances could result in a different deferred income tax liability.
The company records unrecognized tax benefits based on a recognition threshold and valuation method to recognize and measure an income tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return.  The evaluation is based on a two-step approach.  The first step requires the company to evaluate whether the tax position would more likely than not, based upon its technical merits, be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority.  The second step requires the tax position to be measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.  The company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and interest income.  Penalties, if any, are recorded in operating expense.
The companys investments in debt and equity securities at December 31 are as follows (in millions):
Investments in debt and equity securities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31 as follows (in millions):
Investments categorized as trading (including money market funds) totaled $85.0 million and $122.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Corporate bonds and certain other investments are categorized as held-to-maturity.  The contractual maturities of the held-to-maturity investments at December 31, 2010 are as follows (in millions):
 
        Years to maturity
Nicors investments also include certain restricted investments, including certificates of deposit and bank accounts, maintained to fulfill statutory or contractual requirements.  These investments totaled $2.0 million and $3.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  In addition, the company holds a $2.4 million investment in a port facility development venture carried at cost.
Gains or losses included in earnings resulting from the sale of investments were not significant.
 
 
 
Nicor records AROs associated with services, mains and other components of the distribution system and the buildings in its gas distribution business and with certain equipment in its shipping business.  Nicor has not recognized an ARO associated with gathering lines and storage wells in its gas distribution business because there is insufficient company or industry retirement history to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending ARO for the years ended December 31 (in millions):
Substantially all of the ARO is classified as a noncurrent liability.
Gas in storage at December 31 included natural gas inventory of the following subsidiaries (in millions):
Nicor Gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis.  Nicor Enerchanges inventory is carried at the lower of weighted-average cost or market.
Based on the average cost of gas purchased in December 2010 and 2009, the estimated replacement cost of Nicor Gas inventory at December 31, 2010 and 2009 exceeded the LIFO cost by $226.8 million and $288.5 million, respectively.
During 2009, Nicor Gas liquidated 8.8 Bcf of its LIFO-based inventory at an average cost per Mcf of $7.83.  For gas purchased in 2009, the companys average cost per Mcf was $3.89 lower than the average LIFO liquidation rate.  Applying LIFO cost in valuing the liquidation, as opposed to using the average gas purchase cost, had the effect of increasing the cost of gas in 2009 by $34.3 million.
There was no liquidation of LIFO layers during 2010 or 2008.
Since the cost of gas, including inventory costs, is charged to customers without markup, subject to ICC review, the LIFO liquidation in 2009 had no impact on net income.
Nicor Enerchange recorded charges of $7.4 million, $2.8 million and $8.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, resulting from lower of cost or market valuations.
 
 
 
The following table presents the long-term debt of Nicor Gas at December 31, which is classified as long-term obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):
In February 2011, Nicor Gas issued $75 million First Mortgage Bonds at 2.86 percent, due in 2016 through a private placement and utilized the proceeds to retire the $75 million 6.625 percent First Mortgage Bond series which matured in February 2011.
In February 2009, the $50 million 5.37 percent First Mortgage Bond series matured and was retired.  In July 2009, Nicor Gas issued $50 million First Mortgage Bonds at 4.70 percent, due in 2019 through a private placement.
In determining that the bonds issued in 2011 and 2009 qualified for exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Nicor Gas relied on the facts that the bonds were offered only to a limited number of large institutional investors and each institutional investor that purchased the bonds represented that it was purchasing the bonds for its own account and not with a view to distribute them. 
Substantially all gas distribution properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing Nicor Gas First Mortgage Bonds.
In April 2010, Nicor Gas established a $400 million, 364-day revolving credit facility, expiring April 2011 to replace the $550 million, 364-day revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in May 2010 and Nicor and Nicor Gas established a $600 million, three-year revolving credit facility, expiring April 2013 to replace the $600 million, five-year revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in September 2010.  These facilities were established with major domestic and foreign banks and serve as backup for the issuance of commercial paper.  The company had $425 million and $494 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
In 2010, Nicor entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional totaling $90 million.  The swaps hedge the risk associated with the interest payments attributable to the probable issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt in 2012 intended to finance the development of a natural gas storage facility.  Under the terms of the swaps, Nicor agrees to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based on LIBOR.
The company believes it is in compliance with all debt covenants.
 
 
 
The company incurred total interest expense of $38.2 million, $38.8 million and $40.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Interest expense is reported net of amounts capitalized.  Interest expense capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was immaterial.
Nicor Gas may not extend cash advances to an affiliate if Nicor Gas has any outstanding short-term borrowings.  Nicor Gas practice also provides that the balance of cash deposits or advances from Nicor Gas to an affiliate at any time shall not exceed the unused balance of funds actually available to that affiliate under its existing bank credit agreements or its commercial paper facilities with unaffiliated third parties.  Similarly, the balance of cash advances to Nicor Gas from an affiliate may not exceed the unused balance of funds actually available to Nicor Gas under its existing credit agreements or commercial paper facilities with unaffiliated third parties.  Nicor Gas positive cash deposits, if any, may be applied by Nicor to offset negative balances of other Nicor subsidiaries and vice versa.
The fair value of assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis are categorized in the table below (in millions) into three broad levels (with Level 1 considered the most reliable) based upon the valuation inputs.
When available and appropriate, the company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1.  For derivatives, Level 1 values include only those derivative instruments traded on the NYMEX.  The company enters into over-the-counter instruments with values that are similar to, and correlate with, quoted prices for exchange-traded instruments in active markets; the fair values of these over-the-counter items consider credit risk and are classified within Level 2.  In certain instances, the company may be required to determine a fair value using significant unobservable inputs such as indicative broker prices; the resulting valuation is classified as Level 3.
A description of the companys objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, and related accounting policies, is included in Note 2  Accounting Policies  Derivative instruments and Credit risk and concentrations.
 
 
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the Level 3 beginning and ending net derivative asset (liability) balances for the periods ended December 31 (in millions):
Net realized/unrealized gains (losses) included in net income are attributable to Nicor Enerchange and are classified as operating revenues.
Transfers into and out of Level 3 reflect the liquidity at the relevant natural gas trading locations and dates which affects the significance of unobservable inputs used in the valuation.  In 2010, in accordance with new accounting guidance, the company elected to determine both transfers into and out of Level 3 using values at the end of the interim period in which the transfer occurred.  In 2009, transfers into Level 3 were determined using beginning of period values and transfers out of Level 3 were determined using end of period values.
Nicor maintains margin accounts related to financial derivative transactions.  The companys policy is not to offset the fair value of assets and liabilities recognized for derivative instruments or any related margin account.  The following table represents the balance sheet classification of margin accounts related to derivative instruments at December 31 (in millions):
 
In addition, the recorded amount of restricted short and long-term investments and short-term borrowings approximates fair value.  Long-term debt outstanding is recorded at the principal balance outstanding, net of unamortized discounts.  The principal balance of Nicor Gas First Mortgage Bonds outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $500 million.  Based on quoted prices or market interest rates, the fair value of the companys First Mortgage Bonds was approximately $554 million and $543 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
 
 
A description of the companys objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, and related accounting policies, is included in Note 2  Accounting Policies  Derivative instruments and Credit risk and concentrations.  All derivatives recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are measured at fair value, as described in Note 7  Fair Value Measurements.
  Derivative assets and liabilities at December 31 are classified as shown in the table below (in millions):
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Nicor Gas held outstanding derivative contracts of approximately 49 Bcf and 64 Bcf, respectively, to hedge natural gas purchases for customer use, with hedges spanning approximately three years for each of the respective periods.  Commodity price-risk arising from Nicor Enerchanges activities and Nicor Gas natural gas purchases for company use is mitigated with derivative instruments that total to a net short position of 3.9 Bcf and 1.3 Bcf as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The above volumes exclude contracts such as variable-priced contracts and basis swaps, which are accounted for as derivatives but whose fair values are not directly impacted by changes in commodity prices.
Volumes.
As of December 31, 2010, Nicor held forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional totaling $90 million. The swaps hedge the risk associated with the interest payments attributable to the probable issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt in 2012.
-   Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Cash flow hedges used by the companys other energy ventures, to hedge utility-bill management products, are eventually recognized within operating revenues.  Cash flow hedges used by Nicor Gas, to hedge purchases of natural gas for company use, are

eventually recorded within operating and maintenance expense.  Cash flow hedges used by Nicor, to hedge the interest payments attributable to long-term fixed-rate debt, will eventually be recorded within interest expense.
 
 
 
Cash flow hedges affected accumulated other comprehensive income (effective portion) as shown in the following table for the year ended December 31 (in millions):
The pretax loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income (effective portion) is shown in the following table for the year ended December 31 (in millions):
Any amounts recognized in operating income, related to ineffectiveness or due to a forecasted transaction that is no longer expected to occur, were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the time horizon of cash flow hedges of natural gas purchases for Nicor Gas company use and for utility-bill management products sold by Nicors other energy ventures span as long as two years.  For these hedges, the total pretax loss deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $2.0 million ($1.2 million after taxes) and $0.9 million ($0.5 million after taxes), respectively.  At the respective reporting dates, substantially all of these amounts were expected to be reclassified to earnings within the next 12 months.
The amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income for the forward-starting interest rate swaps entered into in 2010 will be amortized to interest expense upon the issuance of long-term fixed rate debt.  The total pretax loss deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2010 was $2.2 million ($1.3 million after taxes).
  The earnings of the company are subject to volatility for those derivatives not designated as hedges.  Non-designated derivatives used by the companys other energy ventures, to hedge energy trading activities and utility-bill management products, are recorded in operating revenues.  Non-designated derivatives used by Nicor Gas, to hedge purchases of natural gas for company use, are recorded within operating and maintenance expense.  Pretax net losses recognized in income are summarized in the table below for the year ended December 31 (in millions):
Consolidated Statements of Income - derivatives not designated as hedges.
Nicor Gas derivatives used to hedge the purchase of natural gas for its customers are also not designated as hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on these derivatives are not recognized in pretax earnings, but are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities until the related revenue is recognized.  Net losses deferred for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $112.0 million and $166.1 million, respectively.
 
 
 
  Provisions within certain derivative agreements require the company to post collateral if the companys net liability position exceeds a specified threshold.  Also, certain derivative agreements contain credit-risk-related contingent features, whereby the company would be required to provide additional collateral or pay the amount due to the counterparty when a credit event occurs, such as if the companys credit rating was to be lowered.  As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 for agreements with such features, derivative contracts with liability fair values totaled approximately $12 million and $20 million, respectively, for which the company had posted no collateral to its counterparties.  If it was assumed that the company had to post the maximum contractually specified collateral or settle the liability, the company would have been required to pay approximately $11 million and $19 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Credit-risk-related contingent features.
The components of income tax expense are presented below (in millions):
The temporary differences which gave rise to the net deferred tax liability at December 31 were as follows (in millions):
 
For purposes of computing deferred income tax assets and liabilities, temporary differences associated with regulatory assets and liabilities have been netted against related offsetting temporary differences.
 
 
 
Differences between the federal statutory rate and the effective combined federal and state income tax rate are shown below:
 
The higher effective income tax rate in 2010 compared to 2009 is due primarily to lower untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the unfavorable impact of the tax law change with respect to Medicare Part D subsidies (included in Other in the table above), partially offset by favorable tax reserve adjustments.  The higher effective income tax rate in 2009 compared to 2008 reflects higher pretax income in 2009 (which causes a higher effective income tax rate since permanent differences and tax credits are a smaller share of pretax income), as well as a decrease in untaxed foreign shipping earnings and the absence of the 2008 tax reserve adjustments.
The company's major tax jurisdictions include the United States and Illinois, with tax returns examined by the IRS and IDR, respectively.  At December 31, 2010, the years that remain subject to examination include years beginning after 2006 for the IRS and the IDR.  For tax positions within years that remain subject to examination, management has recognized the largest amount of tax benefit that it believes is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authority.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were $1.9 million, $4.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized, would affect the companys annual effective tax rate.
If settlements vary from these estimated amounts recognized for unrecognized tax benefits, the company does not anticipate any adjustment would result in a material change to its financial position.  However, the company believes that it is reasonably possible that a change to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits could occur within 12 months, potentially decreasing its unrecognized tax benefit by approximately $3 million.
 
 
 
The company recognized net interest expense (income) on tax matters of approximately $(1) million, $1 million and $(3) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The company had approximately $2
million of interest receivable at December 31, 2010 compared with $5 million of interest receivable as of December 31, 2009.  The decrease in interest receivable in 2010 when compared to the prior year is due primarily to the receipt of interest in the second quarter of 2010 related to a federal income tax settlement.  Amounts recognized in operating expense related to penalties were insignificant.
In March 2010, the Health Care Act was signed into law resulting in comprehensive health care reform.  The Health Care Act contains a provision that eliminates the tax deduction related to Medicare Part D subsidies received after 2012.  Federal subsidies are provided to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans, such as Nicor Gas, that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under Medicare Part D.  Such subsidies have reduced the companys actuarially determined projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit costs.  Due to the change in taxation, in the first quarter of 2010 Nicor Gas reduced deferred tax assets by $17.5 million, reversed an existing regulatory income tax liability of $10.0 million, established a regulatory income tax asset of $7.0 million and recognized a $0.5 million charge to income tax expense.  Beginning in 2010, the change in taxation will also reduce earnings by an estimated $1.7 million annually for periods subsequent to the enactment date.
In 2006, the company reorganized certain shipping and related operations.  The reorganization allows the company to take advantage of certain provisions of the Jobs Act that provide the opportunity for tax savings subsequent to the date of the reorganization.  Generally, to the extent foreign shipping earnings are not repatriated to the United States, such earnings are not expected to be subject to current taxation.  In addition, to the extent such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, no deferred income tax expense would be recorded by the company.  For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, income tax expense has not been provided on approximately $5 million, $19 million and $23 million, respectively, of foreign company shipping earnings.
At December 31, 2010, Nicor has approximately $12 million of deferred income tax liabilities related to approximately $34 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries.  Nicor has not recorded deferred income taxes of approximately $59 million on approximately $170 million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings.
The balance of unamortized investment tax credits at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $24.3 million and $25.2 million, respectively.
Nicor Gas maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired prior to 1998.  Pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest average salary for management employees and job level for collectively bargained employees (referred to as pension bands).  The benefit obligation related to collectively bargained benefits considers the companys past practice of regular benefit increases.  Nicor Gas also provides health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees under a plan that includes a limit on the companys share of cost for employees hired after 1982.
 
 
 
The following table summarizes the changes in the funded status of the plans and the related assets (liabilities) recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31 (in millions):
The companys postretirement benefit costs have historically been considered in rate proceedings in the period they are accrued.  As a regulated utility, Nicor Gas expects continued rate recovery of the eligible costs of its defined benefit postretirement plans and, accordingly, associated changes in the plans funded status have been deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until recognized in net income, instead of being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  However, to the extent Nicor Gas employees perform services for non-regulated affiliates and to the extent such employees are eligible to participate in these plans, the affiliates are charged for the cost of these benefits and the changes in the funded status relating to these employees are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
 
 
 
Postretirement benefit costs (credits) recorded within net regulatory assets and accumulated other comprehensive income, and changes thereto, were as follows (in millions):
The balances as of December 31 relate primarily to unrecognized net actuarial losses.
The associated amounts in net regulatory assets and accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2010 that are expected to be amortized to net benefit cost in 2011 are as follows (in millions):
The accumulated benefit obligation for pension benefits, a measure which excludes the effect of salary and wage increases, was $279.8 million and $269.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
 
 
About one-fourth of the net benefit cost or credit related to these plans has been capitalized as a cost of constructing gas distribution facilities and the remainder is included in gas distribution operating and maintenance expense, net of amounts charged to affiliates.  Net benefit cost (credit) included the following components (in millions):
Assumptions used to determine benefit obligations included the following:
The discount rates for each plan were determined by performing a cash flow matching study using the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve.  The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve is constructed from a Treasury yield curve and adjusted by adding a corporate bond spread.  The corporate bond spread is developed from a large pool of high quality corporate bonds and mitigates the risks associated with selecting individual corporate bonds whose values may not be representative of the broader market.
Assumptions used to determine net benefit cost for the years ended December 31 included the following:
Nicor Gas establishes its expected long-term return on asset assumption by considering historical and projected returns for each investment asset category, asset allocations and the effects of active plan management.  Projected returns are calculated with the assistance of independent firms via probability-based models.  The company has elected to apply this assumption to the fair value of plan assets, rather than to a rolling-average fair value, in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of net benefit cost.
Other assumptions used to determine the health care benefit obligation were as follows:
 
 
 
Other assumptions used to determine the health care benefit cost for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.  A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (in millions):
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 continues to provide a prescription drug benefit as well as a potential federal subsidy to sponsors of certain retiree health care benefit plans whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the Medicare Part D benefit.  Nicor Gas has determined that the prescription drug benefits of its plan are actuarially equivalent and accordingly has reflected the effects of the subsidy in its determination of the benefit obligation and annual net benefit cost.
The Health Care Act contains provisions that may impact Nicor Gas obligation for retiree health care benefits.  The company does not currently believe these provisions will materially increase its postretirement benefit obligation, but will continue to evaluate the impact of future regulations and interpretations.
The companys investment objective relating to pension plan assets is to provide a total investment return which will allow the pension plan to meet its remaining benefit obligations.  The companys investment strategy is to diversify its investments among asset classes in order to reduce risk.  Investment performance is measured against a targeted rate of return which reflects the asset allocation of the plan assets and an appropriate published index return for each asset class.  The company will rebalance the investment portfolio periodically if the actual asset allocation is significantly out of tolerance from the target allocation.
The following table sets forth the companys current asset allocation target and actual percentage of plan assets by major asset category as of December 31:
Equity securities are comprised of collective trusts which invest in domestic and international equity investments.  Domestic equity securities are diversified across the small, mid and large cap asset classes.  International equity securities are diversified across countries and capitalization size in order to maintain a broad market representation of non-U.S. markets.
 
 
 
Fixed income securities are diversified across a broad range of investment grade corporate bonds and other fixed income securities.  Other fixed income securities are primarily comprised of government issued bonds and cash and cash equivalents.  The fixed income portfolio is targeted to maintain an average credit quality rating of at least single-A and a weighted duration that approximates the duration of the expected benefit obligations.
The table below categorizes the fair value of pension plan assets (in millions) based upon the valuation inputs described in Note 7  Fair Value Measurements.  There were no fair values determined using unobservable inputs (Level 3) at December 31, 2010 and 2009.
The company does not expect to contribute to its pension plan in 2011 but does expect to contribute about $14.3 million (before Medicare subsidies) to its other postretirement benefit plan in 2011.  The following table sets forth the gross benefit payments from the plans expected over the next 10 years (in millions):
Nicor also has a separate unfunded supplemental retirement plan and provides unfunded postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to employees of discontinued businesses.  These plans are noncontributory with defined benefits.  Net plan expenses were $0.8 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The projected benefit obligation associated with these plans was $5.5 million and $5.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
 
 
The company also sponsors defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees.  These plans provide for employer matching contributions.  The total cost of these plans was $8.2 million, $7.8 million and $7.6 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Nicor has a long-term incentive compensation plan that permits the granting of restricted stock units and  performance units to key executives and managerial employees, as well as a stock deferral plan, an employee stock purchase plan and directors stock-based compensation plans.
At December 31, 2010, there was $3.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested share-based compensation arrangements.  That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.  The company recognized compensation cost and related tax effects for all share-based compensation arrangements for the years ended December 31 as follows (in millions):
Cash flows related to stock options for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in millions):
The difference between the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the par value of the stock is recorded within Paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
  Restricted stock units represent shares of common stock that generally vest based on continued employment at the end of a four-year period.  Vesting can be accelerated due to certain events such as retirement eligibility, change in control, death or disability.  The fair value of restricted stock units is determined using the companys closing stock price on the grant date.  Compensation cost, measured using the grant date fair value adjusted for a historical forfeiture rate, is recognized over the requisite service period.
Restricted stock units.
A summary of the status of the companys restricted stock units and changes during the year ended December 31, 2010 is as follows:
 
 
 
  Performance units represent cash payments which are paid out based on a measure of relative total shareholder return.  Performance units are earned at the end of a three-year performance period depending on Nicors three-year total shareholder return relative to the performance of other
Performance units.
companies in a predetermined utility industry peer group.  Units vest over approximately three years and can be accelerated due to certain events such as retirement, change in control, death or disability.  The liability for the performance units is adjusted to fair value each quarter-end, and compensation cost is ultimately measured as the settlement date fair value (or cash payment).  Interim fair values are estimated by discounting probability-weighted expected cash flows.  The company paid $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $0.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, to settle performance unit obligations.
 
Among the companysother stock-based compensation plans are liability awards that are re-measured to fair value at the end of each period.  Such re-measurements can cause fluctuations in the amount of recognized compensation expense.  The companys other stock-based compensation plans had an immaterial impact on net income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
Other.  
 
Nicor had 160,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, of which 2,972,852 shares and 3,600,378 shares were reserved for share-based awards and other purposes at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
  Changes in common shares outstanding are below (in millions):
Changes in common shares.
Shares issued during 2010 and 2008 were due primarily to stock option exercises.  There were no repurchases of common stock in 2010, 2009 and 2008 under the common stock repurchase program announced in 2001.
  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Nicor is restricted from paying a dividend in excess of $0.465 per share in any quarter.  Other than the Merger Agreement, Nicor has no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.  Nicor Gas is restricted by regulation in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates.  Dividends are allowed only to the extent of Nicor Gas retained earnings balance.
Dividend restrictions.
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss is comprised of the following at December 31 (in millions):

Voting.
Nicor had 1,600,000 cumulative, $50 par value, preferred shares and 20,000,000 cumulative, no par value, preference shares authorized at December 31, 2010.  In 2010 and 2009, Nicor redeemed 1,431 shares and 10,150 shares, respectively, of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $51.06 and $46.43 per share, respectively, plus accrued unpaid dividends.  As a result, there were no shares of the 4.48 percent Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2010.
Preferred stock.  
In January 2011, Nicor redeemed 247 shares of the 5.00 percent Convertible Preferred Stock, $50 par value, at an average redemption price of $50.13 per share.  Nicor had no shares of preferred stock outstanding following such redemption.
Nicor is a holding company that operates in three separately managed reportable business segments: gas distribution, shipping and wholesale marketing.  The gas distribution segment, Nicors principal business, serves 2.2 million customers in a service territory that encompasses most of the northern third of Illinois, excluding the city of Chicago.  The shipping segment transports containerized freight between Florida, the eastern coast of Canada, the Bahamas and the Caribbean region.  The shipping segment also includes amounts related to cargo insurance coverage sold to its customers and other third parties.  The wholesale marketing segment engages in wholesale marketing of natural gas supply services primarily in the Midwest, administers the Chicago Hub for Nicor Gas, serves commercial and industrial customers in the northern Illinois market area, and manages Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energys product risks, including the purchases of natural gas supplies.
Nicors other businesses operate primarily in northern Illinois and include businesses that market retail energy-related products and services to residential and small business customers through Nicor Services, Nicor Solutions and Nicor Advanced Energy.  They also include a 50-percent-owned natural gas pipeline (Horizon Pipeline) with Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, natural gas storage facility developments (Central Valley and Sawgrass Storage), and a previously owned engineering and consulting firm (EN Engineering), which was sold on March 31, 2009.  Financial information about these other business segments is combined under the heading Other on the table that follows.  Intersegment revenues on the table are presented prior to elimination.
Gas distribution revenues are comprised principally of natural gas sales bundled with delivery, delivery-only (transportation) services and revenue taxes, as follows (in millions):
The shipping segments vessels are under foreign registry, and its containers are considered instruments of international trade.  Although the majority of its long-lived assets are foreign owned and its revenues are derived from foreign operations, the functional currency is generally the U.S. dollar.
 
 
 
Nicor management evaluates segment performance based on operating income.  Intercompany billing for goods and services exchanged between segments is based generally upon direct and indirect costs incurred, but in some instances is based upon the prevailing tariff or market-based price of the provider.
Intersegment revenues include gas distribution revenues related to customers entering into utility-bill management contracts with Nicor Solutions and wholesale marketing revenues from the sale of natural gas to Nicor Advanced Energy.  Under the utility-bill management contracts, Nicor Solutions bills a fixed amount to a customer, regardless of changes in natural gas prices or weather, and in exchange pays the customers utility bills from Nicor Gas.  Nicor Advanced Energy provides natural gas and related services on an unregulated basis to residential and small commercial customers and purchases most of its natural gas supplies from Nicor Enerchange.  Intersegment revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Operating income in the Corporate and eliminations column includes the following items:
Financial data by reportable segment is as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
Equity investment income, net included the following (in millions):
On March 31, 2009, the company sold its 50-percent interest in EN Engineering.  The companys share of the sale price was $16.0 million, with an additional $1.5 million which is contingent on EN Engineerings 2010 performance and is due in 2011.  After closing costs and other adjustments, Nicor received cash of $13.0 million and recorded a gain on the sale of $10.1 million.
In 2010, 2009 and 2008, Nicor received dividends from equity investees of $18.5 million, $10.0 million and $16.0 million, respectively.
Horizon Pipeline charged Nicor Gas $10.4 million, $10.3 million and $10.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 for natural gas transportation under rates that have been accepted by the FERC.
Nicor sold its ownership in EN Engineering on March 31, 2009.  Prior to the sale, EN Engineering charged Nicor Gas $1.7 million and $7.2 million for engineering and corrosion services rendered for 2009 and 2008, respectively.  A majority of the work performed by EN Engineering was capital in nature, and is classified as property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In addition, certain related parties may acquire regulated utility services at rates approved by the ICC.
At December 31, 2010, Nicor had purchase commitments with payments due as follows (in millions):
Unconditional purchase obligations consist of a natural gas transportation agreement and property, plant and equipment purchases.  Operating leases are primarily for vessels, containers and equipment in the shipping business, office space and equipment in the gas distribution business and office space for the companys other energy ventures.
 
 
 
Tropical Shipping has certain equipment operating leases which include escalation clauses for adjusting rent to reflect changes in price indices, various renewal options and options to purchase leased equipment.  Rental expense under operating leases was $25.7 million, $31.4 million and $41.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources and provides that if Nicor terminates the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Nicor may be required to pay a termination fee of $67 million.
On March 25, 2009, the ICC issued an order approving an increase in base revenues of approximately $69 million, a rate of return on rate base of 7.58 percent and a rate of return on equity of 10.17 percent.  The order also approved an energy efficiency rider.  Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the March 25, 2009 order into effect on April 3, 2009.
Rate proceeding.  
On April 24, 2009, Nicor Gas filed a request for rehearing with the ICC concerning the capital structure contained in the ICCs rate order contending the companys return on rate base should be higher.  On October 7, 2009, the ICC issued its decision on rehearing in which it increased the annual base revenues approved for Nicor Gas in the March 25, 2009 order by approximately $11 million, increasing the rate of return on rate base to 8.09 percent.  Nicor Gas placed the rates approved in the rehearing decision into effect on a prospective basis on October 15, 2009.  Therefore, the total annual base revenue increase authorized in the rate case originally filed by the company in April 2008 is approximately $80 million.
  In September 2009, Nicor Gas filed for approval of a bad debt rider with the ICC under an Illinois state law which took effect in July 2009.  On February 2, 2010, the ICC issued an order approving the companys proposed bad debt rider.  This rider provides for recovery from customers of the amount over the benchmark for bad debt expense established in the companys rate cases.  It also provides for refunds to customers if bad debt expense is below such benchmarks.
Bad debt rider.
As a result of the February 2010 order, Nicor Gas recorded in income a net recovery related to 2008 and 2009 of $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, all of which has been collected.  The benchmark, against which 2010 actual bad debt experience is compared, is approximately $63 million.  The companys actual 2010 bad debt experience was $35.7 million, resulting in a refund to customers of $27.3 million which will be refunded over a 12-month period beginning June 2011.
Nicor and certain subsidiaries enter into various financial and performance guarantees and indemnities providing assurance to third parties.
TEL has an obligation to restore to zero any deficit in its equity account for income tax purposes in the unlikely event that Triton is liquidated and a deficit balance remains.  This obligation continues for the life of the Triton partnerships and any payment is effectively limited to the assets of TEL, which were approximately $2 million at December 31, 2010.  Nicor believes the likelihood of any such payment by TEL is remote.  No liability has been recorded for this obligation.
Financial guarantees.  
Nicor Services markets product warranty contracts that provide for the repair of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, natural gas lines and other appliances within homes.  Revenues from these product warranty contracts are recognized ratably over the coverage period, and related repair costs are charged to expense as incurred.  Repair expenses of $10.6 million, $7.9 million and $7.1 million were incurred in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Performance guarantees.
 
 
 
  In certain instances, Nicor has undertaken to indemnify current property owners and others against costs associated with the effects and/or remediation of contaminated sites for which the company may be responsible under applicable federal or state environmental laws, generally with no limitation as to the amount.  These indemnifications relate primarily to ongoing coal tar cleanup, as discussed in Note 20  Contingencies  Manufactured Gas Plant Sites.  Nicor believes that the likelihood of payment under its other environmental indemnifications is remote.  No liability has been recorded for such indemnifications.
Indemnities.
Nicor has also indemnified, to the fullest extent permitted under the laws of the State of Illinois and any other applicable laws, its present and former directors, officers and employees against expenses they may incur in connection with litigation they are a party to by reason of their association with the company.  There is generally no limitation as to the amount.  During 2007, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against three former officers of Nicor relating to the PBR plan.  Defense costs that are being incurred by these former officers in connection with the SEC action currently are being tendered to, and paid by, the companys insurer.  In July 2010, one of these former officers settled the SECs action against him and was indemnified by Nicor.  While the company does not expect to incur significant costs relating to the indemnification of present and former directors, officers and employees after taking into account available insurance, it is not possible to estimate the maximum future potential payments.
The following contingencies of Nicor are in various stages of investigation or disposition.  Although in some cases the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized, it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, will require the company to take charges against, or will result in reductions in, future earnings.  It is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, could be material to earnings in a particular period but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on Nicors liquidity or financial condition.
Nicor Gas PBR plan for natural gas costs went into effect in 2000 and was terminated by the company effective January 1, 2003.  Under the PBR plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market-sensitive benchmark.  Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers.  The PBR plan is currently under ICC review.  There are allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan, and the ICC and others are reviewing these allegations.  On June 27, 2002, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) filed a motion to reopen the record in the ICCs proceedings to review the PBR plan (the ICC Proceedings).  As a result of the motion to reopen, Nicor Gas, the staff of the ICC and CUB entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery.  The Illinois Attorney Generals Office (IAGO) has also intervened in this matter.  In addition, the IAGO issued Civil Investigation Demands (CIDs) to CUB and the ICC staff.  The CIDs ordered that CUB and the ICC staff produce all documents relating to any claims that Nicor Gas may have presented, or caused to be presented, false information related to its PBR plan.  The company has committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the PBR plan.
PBR Plan.  
In response to these allegations, on July 18, 2002, the Nicor Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent, non-management directors to conduct an inquiry into issues surrounding natural gas purchases, sales, transportation, storage and such other matters as may come to the attention of the special committee in the course of its investigation.  The special committee presented the report of its counsel (Report) to Nicors Board of Directors on October 28, 2002.
In response, the Nicor Board of Directors directed the companys management to, among other things, make appropriate adjustments to account for, and fully address, the adverse consequences to ratepayers of the items noted in the Report, and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls.  The adjustments were made in prior years financial statements resulting in a $24.8 million liability.  Included in such $24.8 million liability is a $4.1 million loss contingency.  A $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability, which is discussed below, was made in 2004 increasing the recorded liability to $26.6 million.  Nicor Gas estimates that there is $26.9 million due to the company from the 2002 PBR plan year, which has not been recognized in the financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the PBR plan.  In addition, interest due to the company on certain components of these amounts has not been recognized in the financial statements due to the same uncertainties.  By the end of 2003, the company completed steps to correct the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in the detailed study of the adequacy of internal controls.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the agreement of all parties, including the company, the ICC re-opened the 1999 and 2000 purchased gas adjustment filings for review of certain transactions related to the PBR plan and consolidated the reviews of the 1999-2002 purchased gas adjustment filings with the PBR plan review.
On February 5, 2003, CUB filed a motion for $27 million in sanctions against the company in the ICC Proceedings.  In that motion, CUB alleged that Nicor Gas responses to certain CUB data requests were false.  Also on February 5, 2003, CUB stated in a press release that, in addition to $27 million in sanctions, it would seek additional refunds to consumers.  On March 5, 2003, the ICC staff filed a response brief in support of CUBs motion for sanctions.  On May 1, 2003, the ALJs assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling denying CUBs motion for sanctions.  CUB has filed an appeal of the motion for sanctions with the ICC, and the ICC has indicated that it will not rule on the appeal until the final disposition of the ICC Proceedings.  It is not possible to determine how the ICC will resolve the claims of CUB or other parties to the ICC Proceedings.
In 2004, the company became aware of additional information relating to the activities of individuals affecting the PBR plan for the period from 1999 through 2002, including information consisting of third party documents and recordings of telephone conversations from Entergy-Koch Trading, LP (EKT), a natural gas, storage and transportation trader and consultant with whom Nicor did business under the PBR plan.  Review of additional information completed in 2004 resulted in the $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability referenced above.
The evidentiary hearings on this matter were stayed in 2004 in order to permit the parties to undertake additional third party discovery from EKT.  In December 2006, the additional third party discovery from EKT was obtained and the ALJs issued a scheduling order that provided for Nicor Gas to submit direct testimony by April 13, 2007.  In its direct testimony, Nicor Gas seeks a reimbursement of approximately $6 million, which includes interest due to the company, as noted above, of $1.6 million, as of March 31, 2007.  In September 2009, the staff of the ICC, IAGO and CUB submitted direct testimony to the ICC requesting refunds of $109 million, $255 million and $286 million, respectively.  No date has been set for evidentiary hearings on this matter.
Nicor is unable to predict the outcome of the ICCs review or the companys potential exposure thereunder.  Because the PBR plan and historical gas costs are still under ICC review, the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts reflected in the companys financial statements as of December 31, 2010.
.  Nicor, its board of directors, AGL Resources and one or both of AGL Resources acquisition subsidiaries and, in one instance, Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have been named as defendants in five putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors proposed merger with AGL Resources. The first shareholder action was filed on December 7, 2010 in the Eighteenth Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division ().  The other four actions were filed between December 10, 2010 and December 17, 2010 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (, filed December 10, 2010; , filed December 13, 2010; , filed December 17, 2010; and , filed December 17, 2010).
Litigation relating to proposed merger
Joseph Pirolli v. Nicor Inc., et al.
Maxine Phillips v. Nicor Inc., et al.
Plumbers Local #65 Pension Fund v. Nicor Inc., et al.
Gus Monahu v. Nicor Inc., et al.
Roberto R. Vela v. Russ M. Strobel, et al.
The shareholder actions variously allege, among other things, that the Nicor Board breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate purchase price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders); (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement; and (iii) failing to disclose material information regarding the proposed merger to Nicor shareholders.  The complaints also allege that AGL Resources, Nicor and the acquisition subsidiaries aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The shareholder actions seek, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger and, in certain instances, damages.
 
 
 
 
On January 10, 2011, the four actions filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division were consolidated.  Nicor believes the claims asserted in each lawsuit to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.  The final disposition of these shareholder litigation-related matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition.
  Nicor Gas has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, costs related to its historical use of mercury in various kinds of company equipment.
Mercury.
As of December 31, 2010, Nicor Gas had remaining an estimated liability of $0.6 million related to inspection, cleanup and legal defense costs.  This represents managements best estimate of future costs based on an evaluation of currently available information.  Actual costs may vary from this estimate.  Nicor Gas remains a defendant in several private lawsuits that were filed on August 29, 2000, all in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, seeking a variety of unquantified damages (including bodily injury and property damages) allegedly caused by mercury spillage resulting from the removal of mercury-containing regulators.  Potential liabilities relating to these claims have been assumed by a contractors insurer subject to certain limitations.
The final disposition of these mercury-related matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition.
  Manufactured gas plants were used in the 1800s and early to mid 1900s to produce manufactured gas from coal, creating a coal tar byproduct.  Current environmental laws may require the cleanup of coal tar at certain former manufactured gas plant sites.
Manufactured Gas Plant Sites.
Nicor Gas has identified properties for which it may have some responsibility.  Most of these properties are not presently owned by the company.  Nicor Gas and Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) are parties to an agreement to cooperate in cleaning up residue at many of these properties.  The agreement allocates to Nicor Gas 51.73 percent of cleanup costs for 24 sites, no portion of the cleanup costs for 14 other sites and 50 percent of general remediation program costs that do not relate exclusively to particular sites.  Information regarding preliminary site reviews has been presented to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency for certain properties.  More detailed investigations and remedial activities are complete, in progress or planned at many of these sites.  The results of the detailed site-by-site investigations will determine the extent additional remediation is necessary and provide a basis for estimating additional future costs.  As of December 31, 2010, the company had recorded a liability in connection with these matters of $28.7 million.  In accordance with ICC authorization, the company has been recovering, and expects to continue to recover, these costs from its customers, subject to annual prudence reviews.
 
 
 
In April 2002, Nicor Gas was named as a defendant, together with ComEd, in a lawsuit brought by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (the MWRDGC) under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act seeking recovery of past and future remediation costs and a declaration of the level of appropriate cleanup for a former manufactured gas plant site in Skokie, Illinois now owned by the MWRDGC.  In January 2003, the suit was amended to include a claim under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Management cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or the companys potential exposure thereto, if any, and has not recorded a liability associated with this contingency.
Since costs and recoveries relating to the cleanup of manufactured gas plant sites are passed directly through to customers in accordance with ICC regulations, subject to an annual ICC prudence review, the final disposition of manufactured gas plant matters is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations.
 
  Many municipalities in Nicor Gas service territory have enacted ordinances that impose taxes on gas sales to customers within municipal boundaries.  Most of these municipal taxes are imposed on Nicor Gas based on revenues generated by Nicor Gas within the municipality.  Other municipal taxes are imposed on natural gas consumers within the municipality but are collected from consumers and remitted to the municipality by Nicor Gas.  A number of municipalities have instituted audits of Nicor Gas tax remittances.  In May 2007, five of those municipalities filed an action against Nicor Gas in state court in DuPage County, Illinois relating to these tax audits.  Following a dismissal of this action without prejudice by the trial court, the municipalities filed an amended complaint.  The amended complaint seeks, among other things, compensation for alleged unpaid taxes.  Nicor Gas is contesting the claims in the amended complaint.  In December 2007, 25 additional municipalities, all represented by the same audit firm involved in the lawsuit, issued assessments to Nicor Gas claiming that it failed to provide information requested by the audit firm and owed the municipalities back taxes.  Nicor Gas believes the assessments are improper and has challenged them.  While the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters or to reasonably estimate its potential exposure related thereto, if any, and has not recorded a liability associated with this contingency, the final disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition.
Municipal Tax Matters.
In addition to the matters set forth above, the company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to general claims, taxes, environmental, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters.  Although unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these other contingencies, management believes that these amounts are appropriately reflected in the financial statements, including the recording of appropriate liabilities when reasonably estimable.

Nicor Inc.
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
In December 2010, Nicor entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with AGL Resources, which Nicor expects will be complete in the fourth quarter of 2011.  In accordance with the Merger Agreement, each share of Nicor common stock outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), other than shares to be cancelled and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive consideration consisting of (i) $21.20 in cash and (ii) 0.8382 shares of AGL Resources common stock, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances.
Completion of the proposed merger is conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval by both companies and the receipt of various regulatory approvals.  AGL Resources filed a registration statement with the SEC to register the AGL Resources common stock to be issued in the merger, and the SEC permitted that registration to become effective on April 29, 2011.  AGL Resources and Nicor also filed their pre-merger notifications under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and were granted early termination of the waiting period on April 18, 2011.  The approvals from Nicor shareholders and AGL Resources shareholders required in connection with the merger were received on June 14, 2011.
In January 2011, Nicor, Nicor Gas and AGL Resources filed a joint application with the ICC for approval of the proposed merger.  The approval by the ICC is a condition to completion of the merger.  The ICC has eleven months to act upon the application, with their statutory deadline for action being December 16, 2011.  The application did not request a rate increase and included a commitment to maintain the number of full-time equivalent employees involved in the operation of Nicor Gas at a level comparable to current staffing for a period of three years following merger completion.  The Staff of the ICC and several intervenors who are participating in the proceeding submitted testimony and legal briefs, recommending that the ICC deny the joint application or that it impose various requirements on the joint applicants as conditions of approval.  On September 29, 2011, the ALJ assigned by the ICC to preside over the proceeding issued a proposed order recommending approval of the proposed merger.  The ALJ also recommended imposing the condition that Nicor Gas no longer be permitted to provide sales solicitation for Nicor Services warranty products.  On October 13, 2011, briefs were filed to comment on the proposed order.  Testimony and legal briefs of the parties and the ALJs proposed order are available on the ICCs website.  In ruling on the merger application, the ICC may accept, modify or reject the proposed order recommended by the ALJ.
The merger may also be subject to review by the governmental authorities of various other federal, state or local jurisdictions under the antitrust and utility regulation or other applicable laws of those jurisdictions.  For example, AGL Resources provided a voluntary notice of the merger to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), which included a description of the transaction, described the benefits of the transaction and explained why AGL Resources does not believe that the approval of the NJBPU is required to complete the merger.  AGL Resources provided a similar notice to the Maryland Public Service Commission, which then issued a letter stating that it had reviewed the notification of proposed merger filed by AGL Resources and after considering the matter, noted the transaction.  It is possible that one or more state commissions will open proceedings to determine whether they have jurisdiction over the merger.  In the event that any reviewing authorities are determined to have jurisdiction over the merger transaction, there can be no assurance that the reviewing authorities will permit the applicable statutory waiting periods to expire or that the reviewing authorities will terminate the applicable statutory waiting periods at all, or otherwise approve the merger without restrictions or conditions (which are difficult to predict or quantify) that would have a material adverse effect on the combined company if the merger were completed.
 
 
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Nicor and AGL Resources, and further provides for the payment of fees and expenses upon termination under specified circumstances.  For additional information relating to the proposed merger, please see the joint proxy statement / prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S-4 that was filed with the SEC by AGL Resources on April 29, 2011.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the company has incurred and expensed approximately $0.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of merger transaction costs.  These amounts do not include the cost of company personnel participating in efforts to develop integration plans for the combined entity which are included in operating expenses of the respective companies.  No other adjustments have been made to the financial statements as a result of the proposed merger.
The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Nicor have been prepared by the company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations.  The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the companys 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The information furnished reflects, in the opinion of the company, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.  Results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year due to seasonal and other factors.
The companys management evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the date the financial statements were issued.
  Nicor Gas inventory is carried at cost on a LIFO basis.  Inventory decrements occurring during interim periods that are expected to be restored prior to year-end are charged to cost of gas at the estimated annual replacement cost, and the difference between this cost and the actual LIFO layer cost is recorded on the balance sheet as a temporary LIFO inventory liquidation.  Interim inventory decrements not expected to be restored prior to year-end are charged to cost of gas at the actual LIFO cost of the layers liquidated.  At September 30, 2011 and 2010, there was no inventory decrement.
Gas in storage.
Nicor Enerchanges inventory is carried at the lower of weighted-average cost or market (market is represented by the cash price per the close of business on the last trading day of the period).  Nicor Enerchange recorded charges resulting from lower of cost or market valuations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 of $5.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively, and $2.4 million and $7.4 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2010.
  Nicor Gas is regulated by the ICC, which establishes the rules and regulations governing utility rates and services in Illinois.  As a rate-regulated company, Nicor Gas is required to recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and, accordingly, has recorded regulatory assets and liabilities.  Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through rate riders or base rates, upon approval by the ICC.  Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues collected from ratepayers through a rate rider or base rates, or probable future expenditures.  If Nicor Gas operations become no longer subject to rate regulation, a write-off of net regulatory liabilities would be required.
Regulatory assets and liabilities.
 
 
 
The company had regulatory assets and liabilities as follows (in millions):
All items listed above are classified in Other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the exception of the noncurrent portion of the Regulatory asset retirement liability, which is stated separately.
The ICC does not presently allow Nicor Gas the opportunity to earn a return on its regulatory postretirement asset.  This regulatory postretirement asset is expected to be recovered from ratepayers over a period of approximately 9 to 12 years.  The regulatory assets related to debt are not included in rate base, but are recovered over the term of the debt through the rate of return authorized by the ICC.  Nicor Gas is allowed to recover and is required to pay, using short-term interest rates, the carrying costs related to temporary under or overcollections of natural gas costs, certain environmental costs and energy efficiency program costs charged to its customers.  However, there is no interest associated with the under or overcollections of bad debt expense.
Nicor Gas accrues revenues for estimated deliveries to customers from the date of their last bill until the balance sheet date.  Receivables include accrued unbilled revenues of $34.7 million, $144.8 million and $29.7 million at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, respectively, related primarily to gas distribution operations.
Revenue recognition.
Nicor Gas classifies revenue taxes billed to customers as operating revenues and related taxes incurred as operating expenses.  Revenue taxes included in operating expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 were $14.0 million and $118.7 million, respectively, and $13.8 million and $110.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2010.
 
 
 
Derivative instruments.
 
Cash flows from derivative instruments are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and gains and losses are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, in the same categories as the underlying transactions.
Cash flow hedge accounting may be elected only for highly effective hedges, based upon an assessment, performed at least quarterly, of the historical and probable future correlation of cash flows from the derivative instrument to changes in the expected future cash flows of the hedged item.  To the extent cash flow hedge accounting is applied, the effective portion of any changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  Ineffectiveness, if any, is immediately recognized in operating income.  The amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to earnings when the forecasted transaction is recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, even if the derivative instrument is sold, extinguished or terminated prior to the transaction occurring.  If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to operating income.
.  Derivative instruments, such as futures contracts, options and swap agreements, are utilized primarily in the purchase of natural gas for customers.  These derivative instruments are reflected at fair value and are not designated as hedges.  Realized gains or losses on such instruments are included in the cost of gas delivered and are passed directly through to customers, subject to ICC review, and therefore have no direct impact on earnings.  Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.
Nicor Gas
Nicor Gas enters into swap agreements to reduce the earnings volatility of certain forecasted operating costs arising from fluctuations in natural gas prices, such as the purchase of natural gas for use in company operations.  These derivative instruments are carried at fair value.  To the extent hedge accounting is not elected, changes in such fair values are immediately recorded in the current period as operating and maintenance expense.
.  Derivative instruments, such as futures contracts, options, forward contracts, swap agreements and other energy-related contracts are held by Nicors wholesale natural gas marketing business, Nicor Enerchange, for trading purposes.  Certain of these derivative instruments are used to economically hedge price risk associated with inventories of natural gas, fixed-price purchase and sale agreements and other future natural gas commitments.  Nicor Enerchange records such derivative instruments at fair value and generally does not elect hedge accounting.  As a result, changes in derivative fair values may have a material impact on Nicors financial statements.
Nicor Enerchange
Other derivative instruments are used by Nicor Enerchange to hedge price risks related to the activities of affiliates.  Derivatives are held related to certain utility-bill management products sold to retail customers.  These derivative instruments are carried at fair value and cash flow hedge accounting may or may not be elected.  Other derivative instruments are held for the purpose of hedging the commodity price risk associated with the forecasted purchase of base gas that will be injected as part of the development of the natural gas storage facility by Central Valley.  Such derivative instruments are carried at fair value and cash flow hedge accounting has been elected on a consolidated basis.  The base gas is a component of the storage facilitys construction costs.  Therefore, amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these derivative instruments will not be reclassified to earnings until the storage facility is retired and the base gas is sold.
 Forward-starting interest rate swaps are utilized to hedge the interest payments associated with long-term debt.  These derivative instruments are carried at fair value and cash flow hedge accounting is elected.  The effective portion of any changes in the fair value of the derivatives is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Upon settlement, the deferred amount is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt.
Nicor.
 
 
 
  Nicors major subsidiaries have diversified customer bases and the company believes that it maintains prudent credit policies which mitigate customer receivable, supplier performance and derivative counterparty credit riskThe company is exposed to credit risk in the event a customer or supplier defaults on a contract to pay for or deliver product at agreed-upon terms and conditions, or a counterparty to a derivative instrument defaults on a settlement or otherwise fails to perform under contractual terms.  To manage this risk, the company has established procedures to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, to seek guarantees or collateral back-up in the form of cash or letters of credit, to acquire credit insurance in certain instances, and to limit its exposure to any one counterparty.  Nicor also, in some instances, enters into netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty credit risk.  Fair value measurements consider credit risk.  For assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, credit losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.
Credit risk and concentrations.
.  
On February 2, 2010, the ICC approved a bad debt rider that was filed in 2009 by Nicor Gas.  The bad debt rider provides for the recovery from (or refund to) customers of the difference between Nicor Gas actual bad debt experience on an annual basis and the benchmark bad debt expense included in its rates for the respective year.
The companys investments in debt and equity securities are as follows (in millions):
Investments in debt and equity securities are classified on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (in millions):
Investments categorized as trading (including money market funds) totaled $61.3 million, $85.0 million and $130.8 million at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, respectively.  Corporate bonds and certain other investments are categorized as held-to-maturity.  The contractual maturities of the held-to-maturity investments at September 30, 2011 are as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
Nicors investments also include certain restricted investments, including certificates of deposit and bank accounts, maintained to fulfill statutory or contractual requirements.  These investments totaled $2.4 million, $2.0 million and $2.1 million at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, respectively.  In addition, the company holds a $2.4 million investment in a port facility development venture carried at cost.
There were no significant gains or losses included in earnings resulting from the sale of investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.
In February 2011, Nicor Gas issued $75 million First Mortgage Bonds at 2.86 percent, due in 2016 through a private placement and utilized the proceeds to retire the $75 million 6.625 percent First Mortgage Bond series which matured in February 2011.  In determining that these bonds qualified for exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, Nicor Gas relied on the facts that the bonds were offered only to a limited number of large institutional investors and each institutional investor that purchased the bonds represented that it was purchasing the bonds for its own account and not with a view to distribute them. 
In April 2011, Nicor Gas established a $400 million, 364-day revolving credit facility, expiring April 2012 to replace the $400 million, 364-day revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in April 2011.  In April 2010, Nicor and Nicor Gas established a $600 million, three-year revolving credit facility, expiring April 2013 to replace the $600 million, five-year revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in September 2010.  These facilities were established with major domestic and foreign banks and serve as backup for the issuance of commercial paper.  The company had $312.6 million, $425.0 million and $373.3 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, respectively.
Nicor held forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional totaling $90 million at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010.  The swaps hedge the risk associated with the interest payments attributable to the probable issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt in 2012 intended to finance the development of a natural gas storage facility.  Under the terms of the swaps, Nicor agrees to pay a fixed swap rate and receive a floating rate based on LIBOR.
The company believes it is in compliance with all debt covenants.
 
 
 
The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2011 increased to 61.0 percent from 39.9 percent in the prior year.  The effective income tax rate for both quarters is higher than the expected annual effective income tax rate as it reflects the impact of a reduction in projected annual untaxed foreign shipping earnings identified in the respective quarters.  The year-to-date adjustment to income taxes recognized in the quarter resulting from these changes has a larger impact in quarters with lower income.  The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 increased to 35.4 percent from 33.7 percent in the prior year.  The higher effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 is due primarily to lower forecasted annual untaxed foreign shipping earnings and an increase to the Illinois state income tax rate, partially offset by an adjustment to reduce certain state income tax liabilities in the first quarter of 2011 and lower forecasted annual pretax income.  Effective January 1, 2011, the State of Illinois raised the corporate income tax rate from 7.3 percent to 9.5 percent.
In 2006, the company reorganized certain shipping and related operations.  The reorganization allows the company to take advantage of certain provisions of the Jobs Act that provide the opportunity for tax savings subsequent to the date of the reorganization.  Generally, to the extent foreign shipping earnings are not repatriated to the United States, such earnings are not expected to be subject to current taxation.  In addition, to the extent such earnings are determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, no deferred income tax expense would be recorded by the company.  For the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, an income tax benefit (expense) has not been recognized (provided) on approximately $6 million and $(1) million, respectively, of foreign company shipping losses (earnings).  For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, an income tax benefit has not been recognized on approximately $14 million of foreign company shipping losses.  There were no significant untaxed foreign company shipping earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2010.  As of September 30, 2011, Nicor has not recorded deferred income taxes of approximately $54 million on approximately $156 million of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings.
The company's major tax jurisdictions include the United States and Illinois, with tax returns examined by the IRS and IDR, respectively.  At September 30, 2011, the years that remain subject to examination include years beginning after 2007 for the IRS and after 2006 for the IDR.  The company had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2011.  The decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits from $2.9 million at December 31, 2010 was due to a reduction in state tax reserves.  The company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that a significant change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could occur within 12 months.
The balance of unamortized investment tax credits at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010 was $22.9 million, $24.3 million and $23.7 million, respectively.
 
 
 
The fair value of assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis are categorized in the table below (in millions) into three broad levels (with Level 1 considered the most reliable) based upon the valuation inputs.
When available and appropriate, the company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1.  For derivatives, Level 1 values include only those derivative instruments traded on the NYMEX.  The company enters into over-the-counter instruments with values that are similar to, and correlate with, quoted prices for exchange-traded instruments in active markets; the fair values of these over-the-counter items consider credit risk and are classified within Level 2.  In certain instances, the company may be required to determine a fair value using significant unobservable inputs such as indicative broker prices; the resulting valuation is classified as Level 3.
 
 
 
A description of the companys objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, and related accounting policies, is included in Note 3  Accounting Policies  Derivative instruments and Credit risk and concentrations.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the Level 3 beginning and ending net derivative asset (liability) balances (in millions):
Net realized/unrealized gains (losses) included in net income are attributable to Nicor Enerchange and are classified as operating revenues.
Transfers into and out of Level 3 reflect the liquidity at the relevant natural gas trading locations and dates which affects the significance of unobservable inputs used in the valuation.  Transfers into and out of Level 3 are determined using values at the end of the interim period in which the transfer occurred.
Nicor maintains margin accounts related to financial derivative transactions.  The companys policy is not to offset the fair value of assets and liabilities recognized for derivative instruments or any related margin account.  The following table represents the balance sheet classification of margin accounts related to derivative instruments (in millions):
In addition, the recorded amount of restricted short and long-term investments and short-term borrowings approximates fair value.  Long-term debt outstanding, including current maturities, is recorded at the principal balance outstanding, net of unamortized discounts.  The principal balance of Nicor Gas First Mortgage Bonds outstanding at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010 was $500 million.  Based on quoted prices or market interest rates, the fair value of the companys First Mortgage Bonds outstanding was approximately $621 million, $554 million and $575 million at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, respectively.
 
 
 
A description of the companys objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, and related accounting policies, is included in Note 3  Accounting Policies  Derivative instruments and Credit risk and concentrations.  All derivatives recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are measured at fair value, as described in Note 7  Fair Value Measurements.
  Derivative assets and liabilities are classified as shown in the table below (in millions):
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
  As of September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, Nicor Gas held outstanding derivative contracts of approximately 30 Bcf, 49 Bcf and 48 Bcf, respectively, to hedge natural gas purchases for customer use, with hedges spanning as long as three years.  Commodity price-risk exposure arising from Nicor Enerchanges activities and Nicor Gas natural gas purchases for company use is mitigated with derivative instruments that total to a net short position of 4.5 Bcf, 3.9 Bcf and 3.0 Bcf as of September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, respectively.  The above volumes exclude contracts such as variable-priced contracts and basis swaps, which are accounted for as derivatives but whose fair values are not directly impacted by changes in commodity prices.
Volumes.
Nicor held forward-starting interest rate swaps with a notional totaling $90 million at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010.  The swaps hedge the risk associated with the interest payments attributable to the probable issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt in 2012.
 
 
 
   Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction is recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  Cash flow hedges used by the companys other energy ventures, to hedge utility-bill management products, are eventually recognized within operating revenues.  Cash flow hedges used by Nicor Gas, to hedge purchases of natural gas for company use, are eventually recorded within operating and maintenance expense.  Cash flow hedges used by Nicor, to hedge the interest payments attributable to long-term fixed-rate debt, will eventually be recorded within interest expense.
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income
cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedges affected accumulated other comprehensive income (effective portion) as shown in the following table (in millions):
The pretax loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income (effective portion) is shown in the following table (in millions):
Any amounts recognized in operating income, related to ineffectiveness or due to a forecasted transaction that is no longer expected to occur, were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.
As of September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, the time horizon of cash flow hedges of natural gas purchases for Nicor Gas company use and for utility-bill management products sold by Nicors other energy ventures span as long as two years.  For these hedges, the total pretax loss deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010 was $2.2 million ($1.3 million after taxes), $2.0 million ($1.2 million after taxes) and $4.2 million ($2.5 million after taxes), respectively.  At the respective reporting dates, substantially all of these amounts were expected to be reclassified to earnings within the next 12 months.
The amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income for the forward-starting interest rate swaps will be amortized to interest expense upon the issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt.  The total pretax loss deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to the interest rate swaps at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010 was $13.7 million ($8.1 million after taxes), $2.2 million ($1.3 million after taxes) and $7.5 million ($4.5 million after taxes), respectively.
 
 
 
  The earnings of the company are subject to volatility for those derivatives not designated as hedges.  Non-designated derivatives used by the companys other energy ventures, to hedge energy trading activities and utility-bill management products, are recorded in operating revenues.  Non-designated derivatives used by Nicor Gas, to hedge purchases of natural gas for company use, are recorded within operating and maintenance expense.  Pretax net gains (losses) recognized in income are summarized in the table below (in millions):
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income  derivatives not designated as hedges.
Nicor Gas derivatives used to hedge the purchase of natural gas for its customers are also not designated as hedging instruments.  Gains or losses on these derivatives are not recognized in pretax earnings, but are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities until the related revenue is recognized.  Net losses deferred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 were $29.0 million and $32.6 million, respectively, and $47.5 million and $121.6 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2010.
  Provisions within certain derivative agreements require the company to post collateral if the companys net liability position exceeds a specified threshold.  Also, certain derivative agreements contain credit-risk-related contingent features, whereby the company would be required to provide additional collateral or pay the amount due to the counterparty when a credit event occurs, such as if the companys credit rating was to be lowered.  As of September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010 for agreements with such features, derivative contracts with liability fair values totaled approximately $17 million, $12 million and $17 million, respectively, for which the company had posted no collateral to its counterparties.  If it was assumed that the company had to post the maximum contractually specified collateral or settle the liability, the company would have been required to pay approximately $17 million, $11 million and $16 million at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, respectively.
Credit-risk-related contingent features.
Nicor Gas maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired prior to 1998.  Pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest average salary for management employees and job level for collectively bargained employees (referred to as pension bands).  The benefit obligation related to collectively bargained benefits considers the companys past practice of regular benefit increases.  Nicor Gas also provides health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees under a plan that includes a limit on the companys share of cost for employees hired after 1982.
The companys postretirement benefit costs have historically been considered in rate proceedings in the period they are accrued.  As a regulated utility, Nicor Gas expects continued rate recovery of the eligible costs of its defined benefit postretirement plans and, accordingly, associated changes in the plans funded status have been deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until recognized in net income, instead of being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  However, to the extent Nicor Gas employees perform services for non-regulated affiliates and to the extent such employees are eligible to participate in these plans, the affiliates are charged for the cost of these benefits and the changes in the funded status relating to these employees are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
 
 
 
About one-fourth of the net benefit cost related to these plans has been capitalized as a cost of constructing gas distribution facilities and the remainder is included in gas distribution operating and maintenance expense, net of amounts charged to affiliates.  Net benefit cost included the following components (in millions):
 
The Health Care Act contains provisions that may impact Nicor Gas obligation for retiree health care benefits.  The company does not currently believe these provisions will materially increase its postretirement benefit obligation, but will continue to evaluate the impact of future regulations and interpretations.
Equity investment income includes investment income from Triton of $3.8 million and $11.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively, and $1.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2010.  Nicor received cash distributions from equity investees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 of $4.3 million and $12.5 million, respectively, and $6.1 million and $14.0 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2010.
Total comprehensive income (loss) is as follows (in millions):
Other comprehensive loss consists primarily of net gains and losses from derivative financial instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and gains and losses from postretirement benefits.
Financial data by reportable segment is as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
 
 
 
Intersegment revenues include gas distribution revenues related to customers entering into utility-bill management contracts with Nicor Solutions and wholesale marketing revenues from the sale of natural gas to Nicor Advanced Energy.  Under the utility-bill management contracts, Nicor Solutions bills a fixed amount to a customer, regardless of changes in natural gas prices or weather, and in exchange pays the customers utility bills from Nicor Gas.  Nicor Advanced Energy provides natural gas and related services on an unregulated basis to residential and small commercial customers and purchases most of its natural gas supplies from Nicor Enerchange.  Intersegment revenues are eliminated in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Costs (benefits) associated with Nicors other energy ventures utility-bill management contracts attributable to variances from normal weather for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 were $0.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively, and $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2010.  The weather impact of these contracts generally serves to partially offset the gas distribution segments weather risk.  This cost (benefit) is recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries.  Additionally, operating income of corporate and eliminations includes merger transaction costs of approximately $0.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011.
  In September 2009, Nicor Gas filed for approval of a bad debt rider with the ICC under an Illinois state law which took effect in July 2009.  On February 2, 2010, the ICC issued an order approving the companys proposed bad debt rider.  This rider provides for recovery from customers of the amount over the benchmark for bad debt expense established in the companys rate cases.  It also provides for refunds to customers if bad debt expense is below such benchmarks.
Bad debt rider.
As a result of the February 2010 order, Nicor Gas recorded in income a net recovery related to 2008 and 2009 of $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, all of which has been collected.  The benchmark, against which 2011 and 2010 actual bad debt experience is compared, is approximately $63 million.  The companys actual 2010 bad debt experience was $35.7 million, resulting in a refund to customers of $27.3 million which is being refunded over a 12-month period that began June 2011.
  Nicor Gas signed an agreement in the third quarter of 2011 to purchase approximately 25 Bcf of SNG annually for a 10-year term beginning as early as 2015.  The counterparty intends to construct a 60 Bcf per year coal gasification plant in southern Illinois.  The project is expected to be financed by the counterparty with external debt and equity.  In addition, the final price of the SNG may exceed market prices and is dependent upon a variety of factors, including plant construction costs, and is not estimable.  However, this agreement complies with an Illinois statute that authorizes full recovery of the purchase costs; therefore the company expects to recover such costs.  Since the purchase agreement is contingent upon various milestones to be achieved by the counterparty to the agreement, the companys obligation is not certain at this time.  While the purchase agreement is a variable interest in the counterparty, Nicor Gas has concluded, based on a qualitative evaluation, that it is not the primary beneficiary required to consolidate the counterparty.  No amount has been recognized on Nicors balance sheet in connection with the purchase agreement.
SNG plant legislation.
On October 11, 2011, the IPA approved the form of a draft 30-year contract for the purchase of 20 Bcf per year of SNG from a second proposed plant.  The draft contract approved by the IPA has been submitted to the ICC for further approvals by that regulatory body.  The ICC is expected to approve a final form of contract for the second plant in 2012.
 
 
 
Nicor and certain subsidiaries enter into various financial and performance guarantees and indemnities providing assurance to third parties.
TEL has an obligation to restore to zero any deficit in its equity account for income tax purposes in the unlikely event that Triton is liquidated and a deficit balance remains.  This obligation continues for the life of the Triton partnerships and any payment is effectively limited to the assets of TEL, which were zero at September 30, 2011.  Nicor believes the likelihood of any such payment by TEL is remote.  No liability has been recorded for this obligation.
Financial guarantees.  
Directly or through a subsidiary, Nicor Services markets product warranty contracts that provide for the repair of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, natural gas lines and other appliances within homes.  Revenues from these product warranty contracts are recognized ratably over the coverage period, and related repair costs are charged to expense as incurred.  Repair expenses of $3.2 million and $9.1 million were incurred in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively, and $2.7 million and $7.5 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2010.
Performance guarantees.
  In certain instances, Nicor has undertaken to indemnify current property owners and others against costs associated with the effects and/or remediation of contaminated sites for which the company may be responsible under applicable federal or state environmental laws, generally with no limitation as to the amount.  These indemnifications relate primarily to ongoing coal tar cleanup, as discussed in Note 15  Contingencies  Manufactured Gas Plant Sites.  Nicor believes that the likelihood of payment under its other environmental indemnifications is remote.  No liability has been recorded for such indemnifications.
Indemnities.
Nicor has also indemnified, to the fullest extent permitted under the laws of the State of Illinois and any other applicable laws, its present and former directors, officers and employees against expenses they may incur in connection with litigation they are a party to by reason of their association with the company.  There is generally no limitation as to the amount.  During 2007, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against three former officers of Nicor relating to the PBR Plan.  Defense costs that are being incurred by these former officers in connection with the SEC action currently are being tendered to, and paid by, the companys insurer.  In July 2010, one of these former officers settled the SECs action against him and was indemnified by Nicor.  While the company does not expect to incur significant costs relating to the indemnification of present and former directors, officers and employees after taking into account available insurance, it is not possible to estimate the maximum future potential payments.
The following contingencies of Nicor are in various stages of investigation or disposition.  Although in some cases the company is unable to estimate the amount of loss reasonably possible in addition to any amounts already recognized, it is possible that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, will require the company to take charges against, or will result in reductions in, future earnings.  It is the opinion of management that the resolution of these contingencies, either individually or in aggregate, could be material to earnings in a particular period but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on Nicors liquidity or financial condition.
Nicor Gas PBR plan for natural gas costs went into effect in 2000 and was terminated by the company effective January 1, 2003.  Under the PBR plan, Nicor Gas total gas supply costs were compared to a market-sensitive benchmark.  Savings and losses relative to the benchmark were determined annually and shared equally with sales customers.  The PBR plan is currently under ICC review.  There are allegations that the company acted improperly in connection with the PBR plan, and the ICC and others are reviewing these allegations.  On June 27, 2002, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) filed a motion to reopen the record in the ICCs proceedings to review the PBR plan (the ICC Proceedings).  As a result of the motion to reopen, Nicor Gas, the staff of the ICC and CUB entered into a stipulation providing for additional discovery.  The Illinois Attorney Generals Office (IAGO) has also intervened in this matter.  In addition, the IAGO issued Civil Investigation Demands (CIDs) to CUB and the ICC staff.  The CIDs ordered that CUB and the ICC staff produce all documents relating to any claims that Nicor Gas may have presented, or caused to be presented, false information related to its PBR plan.  The company has committed to cooperate fully in the reviews of the PBR plan.
PBR Plan.  
 
 
 
In response to these allegations, on July 18, 2002, the Nicor Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent, non-management directors to conduct an inquiry into issues surrounding natural gas purchases, sales, transportation, storage and such other matters as may come to the attention of the special committee in the course of its investigation.  The special committee presented the report of its counsel (Report) to Nicors Board of Directors on October 28, 2002.
In response, the Nicor Board of Directors directed the companys management to, among other things, make appropriate adjustments to account for, and fully address, the adverse consequences to ratepayers of the items noted in the Report, and conduct a detailed study of the adequacy of internal accounting and regulatory controls.  The adjustments were made in prior years financial statements resulting in a $24.8 million liability.  Included in such $24.8 million liability is a $4.1 million loss contingency.  A $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability, which is discussed below, was made in 2004 increasing the recorded liability to $26.6 million.  Nicor Gas estimates that there is $26.9 million due to the company from the 2002 PBR plan year, which has not been recognized in the financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the PBR plan.  In addition, interest due to the company on certain components of these amounts has not been recognized in the financial statements due to the same uncertainties.  By the end of 2003, the company completed steps to correct the weaknesses and deficiencies identified in the detailed study of the adequacy of internal controls.
Pursuant to the agreement of all parties, including the company, the ICC re-opened the 1999 and 2000 purchased gas adjustment filings for review of certain transactions related to the PBR plan and consolidated the reviews of the 1999-2002 purchased gas adjustment filings with the PBR plan review.
On February 5, 2003, CUB filed a motion for $27 million in sanctions against the company in the ICC Proceedings.  In that motion, CUB alleged that Nicor Gas responses to certain CUB data requests were false.  Also on February 5, 2003, CUB stated in a press release that, in addition to $27 million in sanctions, it would seek additional refunds to consumers.  On March 5, 2003, the ICC staff filed a response brief in support of CUBs motion for sanctions.  On May 1, 2003, the ALJs assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling denying CUBs motion for sanctions.  CUB has filed an appeal of the motion for sanctions with the ICC, and the ICC has indicated that it will not rule on the appeal until the final disposition of the ICC Proceedings.  It is not possible to determine how the ICC will resolve the claims of CUB or other parties to the ICC Proceedings.
In 2004, the company became aware of additional information relating to the activities of individuals affecting the PBR plan for the period from 1999 through 2002, including information consisting of third party documents and recordings of telephone conversations from Entergy-Koch Trading, LP (EKT), a natural gas, storage and transportation trader and consultant with whom Nicor did business under the PBR plan.  Review of additional information completed in 2004 resulted in the $1.8 million adjustment to the previously recorded liability referenced above.
The evidentiary hearings on this matter were stayed in 2004 in order to permit the parties to undertake additional third party discovery from EKT.  In December 2006, the additional third party discovery from EKT was obtained and the ALJs issued a scheduling order that provided for Nicor Gas to submit direct testimony by April 13, 2007.  In its direct testimony, Nicor Gas sought a reimbursement of approximately $6 million, which included interest due to the company, as noted above, of $1.6 million, as of March 31, 2007, and it reaffirmed this position in rebuttal testimony submitted in April 2011.  The staff of the ICC, IAGO and CUB submitted direct testimony to the ICC in April 2009 and rebuttal testimony in October 2011.  In rebuttal testimony, the staff of the ICC, IAOG and CUB requested refunds of $85 million, $255 million and $305 million, respectively.  No date has been set for evidentiary hearings on this matter.
 
 
 
Nicor is unable to predict the outcome of the ICCs review or the companys potential exposure thereunder.  Because the PBR plan and historical gas costs are still under ICC review, the final outcome could be materially different than the amounts reflected in the companys financial statements as of September 30, 2011.
.  Nicor, its board of directors, AGL Resources and one or both of AGL Resources acquisition subsidiaries and, in one instance, Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have been named as defendants in six putative class action lawsuits brought by purported Nicor shareholders challenging Nicors proposed merger with AGL Resources, two of which, including the lawsuit that named Nicors Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer as a defendant, have subsequently been voluntarily dismissed.  The first action, (the Pirolli Action) was filed on December 7, 2010 in the Eighteenth Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (DuPage County Court).  Four other actions were filed between December 10, 2010 and December 17, 2010 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division (Cook County Court): , filed December 10, 2010; , filed December 13, 2010; , filed December 17, 2010; and , filed December 17, 2010.  The sixth action, which is both an individual action and a putative class action, was filed on March 1, 2011 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division and captioned (the Federal Action).
Litigation relating to proposed merger
Joseph Pirolli v. Nicor Inc., et al.

Plumbers Local #65 Pension Fund v. Nicor Inc., et al.
Gus Monahu v. Nicor Inc., et al.
Roberto R. Vela v. Russ M. Strobel, et al.
Maxine Phillips v. Nicor Inc.,et al.
On January 10, 2011, the four actions filed in the Cook County Court were consolidated (the Consolidated Action).  On February 18, 2011, plaintiffs in the Consolidated Action filed an amended complaint (the Consolidated Amended Complaint).  On February 28, 2011, the Phillips Action in the Cook County Court was voluntarily dismissed and, on March 7, 2011, the Pirolli Action in DuPage County Court was voluntarily dismissed.  Accordingly, the remaining cases pending are the Consolidated Action and the Federal Action.
The Consolidated Amended Complaint alleges, among other things, that: (a) the Nicor Board breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate purchase price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders), (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement and failing to solicit other potential bids or alternative transactions and (iii) failing to disclose material information regarding the proposed merger to Nicor shareholders; and (b) AGL Resources, Nicor and the acquisition subsidiaries aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.  The Consolidated Amended Complaint seeks, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger.
The Federal Action asserts both individual and purported class claims for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of the federal securities laws.  Among other things, plaintiffs allege that: (i) Nicor and the Nicor board of directors violated Section 14(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (sometimes referred to as the Exchange Act) and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder by issuing a materially incomplete registration statement in connection with the proposed merger; and (ii) the Nicor board of directors violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by virtue of its control over the content and dissemination of that registration statement.  The Federal Action also claims that: (a) the Nicor board of directors breached its fiduciary duties to Nicor and its shareholders by (i) approving the sale of Nicor to AGL Resources at an inadequate price (and thus failing to maximize value to Nicor shareholders), (ii) conducting an inadequate sale process by agreeing to preclusive deal protection provisions in the Merger Agreement and failing to solicit other potential bids or alternative transactions and (iii) failing to disclose material information regarding the proposed merger; and (b) Nicor and AGL Resources aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.  The Federal Action seeks, among other things, damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the proposed merger.
 
 
 
On May 25
,
2011, solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, Nicor and the other named defendants signed a memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs to settle the Consolidated Action and the Federal Action.  This memorandum of understanding provides, among other things, that the parties will seek to enter into a stipulation of settlement which provides for the release of all asserted claims.  The asserted claims will not be released until such stipulation of settlement is approved by the court.  Additionally, as part of the memorandum of understanding, Nicor and AGL Resources made certain additional disclosures related to the proposed merger.  Finally, in connection with the proposed settlement, plaintiffs intend to seek, and the defendants have agreed to pay, an award of attorneys fees and expenses of $675,000, subject to court approval.
  Nicor Gas remains a defendant in several private lawsuits that were filed on August 29, 2000, all in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, seeking a variety of unquantified damages (including bodily injury and property damages) allegedly caused by mercury spillage resulting from the removal of mercury-containing regulators.  Potential liabilities relating to these claims have been assumed by a contractors insurer, subject to certain limitations.  The final disposition of these mercury-related matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition.
Mercury.
  Manufactured gas plants were used in the 1800s and early to mid 1900s to produce manufactured gas from coal, creating a coal tar byproduct.  Current environmental laws may require the cleanup of coal tar at certain former manufactured gas plant sites.
Manufactured Gas Plant Sites.
Nicor Gas has identified properties for which it may have some responsibility.  Most of these properties are not presently owned by the company.  Nicor Gas and Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) are parties to an agreement to cooperate in cleaning up residue at many of these properties.  The agreement allocates to Nicor Gas 51.73 percent of cleanup costs for 24 sites, no portion of the cleanup costs for 14 other sites and 50 percent of general remediation program costs that do not relate exclusively to particular sites.  Information regarding preliminary site reviews has been presented to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency for certain properties.  More detailed investigations and remedial activities are complete, in progress or planned at many of these sites.  The results of the detailed site-by-site investigations will determine the extent additional remediation is necessary and provide a basis for estimating additional future costs.  
In April 2002, Nicor Gas was named as a defendant, together with ComEd, in a lawsuit brought by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (the MWRDGC) under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act seeking recovery of past and future remediation costs and a declaration of the level of appropriate cleanup for a former manufactured gas plant site in Skokie, Illinois now owned by the MWRDGC.  In January 2003, the suit was amended to include a claim under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  In September 2011, Nicor Gas and ComEd entered into a settlement with the MWRDGC addressing the appropriate level of cleanup for this former manufactured gas plant site and the lawsuit has been dismissed.
As of September 30, 2011, the company had recorded a liability in connection with these matters of $52.7 million.  In accordance with ICC authorization, the company has been recovering, and expects to continue to recover, these costs from its customers.  Since costs and recoveries relating to the cleanup of manufactured gas plant sites are passed directly through to customers, subject to an annual ICC prudence review, the final disposition of manufactured gas plant matters is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations.
 
 
 
  Many municipalities in Nicor Gas service territory have enacted ordinances that impose taxes on gas sales to customers within municipal boundaries.  Most of these municipal taxes are imposed on Nicor Gas based on revenues generated by Nicor Gas within the municipality.  Other municipal taxes are imposed on natural gas consumers within the municipality but are collected from consumers and remitted to the municipality by Nicor Gas.  A number of municipalities have instituted audits of Nicor Gas tax remittances.  In May 2007, five of those municipalities filed an action against Nicor Gas in state court in DuPage County, Illinois relating to these tax audits.  Following a dismissal of this action without prejudice by the trial court, the municipalities filed an amended complaint.  The amended complaint seeks, among other things, compensation for alleged unpaid taxes.  Nicor Gas is contesting the claims in the amended complaint.  In December 2007, 25 additional municipalities, all represented by the same audit firm involved in the lawsuit, issued assessments to Nicor Gas claiming that it failed to provide information requested by the audit firm and owed the municipalities back taxes.  Nicor Gas believes the assessments are improper and has challenged them.  While the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters or to reasonably estimate its potential exposure related thereto, if any, and has not recorded a liability associated with this contingency, the final disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition.
Municipal Tax Matters.
In the first quarter of 2011, three putative class actions were filed against Nicor Services and Nicor Gas, and in one case against Nicor.  In September 2011, the three cases were consolidated into a single class action pending in state court in Cook County, Illinois.  The plaintiffs purport to represent a class of customers of Nicor Gas who purchased appliance warranty and service plans from Nicor Services and/or a class of customers of Nicor Gas who purchased the Gas Line Comfort Guard product from Nicor Services.  In the consolidated action, the plaintiffs variously allege that the marketing, sale and billing of the Nicor Services appliance warranty and service plans and Gas Line Comfort Guard violate the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, constitute common law fraud and result in unjust enrichment of Nicor Gas and Nicor Services.  The plaintiffs seek, on behalf of the classes they purport to represent, actual and punitive damages, interest, costs, attorneys fees and injunctive relief.  While the company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or to reasonably estimate its potential exposure related thereto, if any, and has not recorded a liability associated with this contingency, the final disposition of this matter is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity or financial condition.
Nicor Services Warranty Product Actions.  
In addition to the matters set forth above, the company is involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to general claims, taxes, environmental, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters.  Although unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these other contingencies, management believes that these amounts are appropriately reflected in the financial statements, including the recording of appropriate liabilities when reasonably estimable.

Exhibit 99.4
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Financial Statements (sometimes referred to as pro forma financial statements) have been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of AGL Resources Inc. (AGL Resources) and Nicor Inc. (Nicor).
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Statements of Income (sometimes referred to as pro forma statements of income) for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, and for the year ended December 31, 2010, give effect to the merger as if it were completed on January 1, 2010. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Financial Position (sometimes referred to as pro forma balance sheet) as of September 30, 2011, gives effect to the merger as if it were completed on September 30, 2011.
 
The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the pro forma financial statements to give effect to pro forma events that are: (i) directly attributable to the merger; (ii) factually supportable; and (iii) with respect to the pro forma statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results of AGL Resources and Nicor. As such, the impact from merger-related expenses is not included in the accompanying pro forma statements of income. However, the impact of these expenses is reflected in the pro forma balance sheet as a decrease to retained earnings. Further, the pro forma financial statements do not reflect any cost savings (or associated costs to achieve such savings) from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructuring that could result from the merger.
 
The acquisition of Nicor common stock by AGL Resources in the merger will be accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting and the regulations of the SEC. The final purchase price will be computed using (i) Nicors outstanding shares immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and the market value of AGL Resources common stock issued in connection with the merger based on the volume-weighted average price of AGL Resources common stock the business day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger, (ii) the cost of debt issued based on Nicors outstanding shares immediately preceding the effective time of the merger and the commitment to pay cash of $21.20 per Nicor common share and (iii) the cash payment to settle shares outstanding under Nicors stock compensation plans.
 
Assumptions and estimates underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in connection with the pro forma financial statements. Since the pro forma financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates, the final amounts recorded may differ materially from the information presented. These estimates are subject to change pending further review of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 
The pro forma financial statements have been presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of results of operations and financial position that would have been achieved had the pro forma events taken place on the dates indicated, or the future consolidated results of operations or financial position of the combined company.
 
The following pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with:
 
 
 
 
See accompanying Notes to the Pro Forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Financial Statements, which are an integral part of these statements.
 
 
 
See accompanying Notes to the Pro Forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Financial Statements, which are an integral part of these statements.
 
 
 
See accompanying Notes to the Pro Forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Financial Statements, which are an integral part of these statements.
 
 
 
 
 
The pro forma statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, and for the year ended December 31, 2010, give effect to the merger as if it were completed on January 1, 2010. The pro forma statement of financial position as of September 30, 2011, gives effect to the merger as if it were completed on September 30, 2011.
 
The pro forma financial statements have been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of AGL Resources and Nicor. Assumptions and estimates underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with the pro forma financial statements. Since the pro forma financial statements have been prepared based upon preliminary estimates, the final amounts recorded may differ materially from the information presented. These estimates are subject to change pending further review of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 
The merger is reflected in the pro forma financial statements as being accounted for based on the guidance provided by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 (sometimes referred to as ASC 805), . Under the acquisition method, the preliminary purchase price is calculated as described in Note 2 to the pro forma financial statements. In accordance with ASC 805, the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed, have been measured at fair value. The fair value measurements utilize estimates based on key assumptions of the merger, including prior acquisition experience, benchmarking of similar acquisitions and historical and current market data. The pro forma adjustments included herein may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. The final purchase price allocation may differ materially from the information presented.
Business Combinations
 
Estimated transaction costs have been excluded from the pro forma statements of income as they reflect non-recurring charges directly related to the merger. However, the anticipated transaction costs are reflected in the pro forma balance sheet, as an adjustment to accrued expenses and a reduction to retained earnings. Further, the pro forma financial statements do not reflect any cost savings (or associated costs to achieve such savings) from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructuring that could result from the merger.
For the purpose of measuring the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as reflected in the pro forma financial statements, AGL Resources has applied ASC 820, , which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
 
AGL Resources acquired all of the outstanding shares of Nicors common stock. The preliminary purchase price for the merger is as follows:
 
 
The preliminary purchase price was computed using (i) Nicors shares outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and the market value of AGL Resources common stock issued in connection with the merger based on the volume-weighted average price of AGL Resources common stock on December 8, 2011, (ii) the cost of debt issued based on Nicors shares outstanding immediately preceding the effective time of the merger and the commitment to pay cash of $21.20 per Nicor common share and (iii) the cash payment to settle the additional shares outstanding under Nicors stock compensation plans. The cash payment per additional share was calculated based on the exchange ratio multiplied by the volume-weighted average price of AGL Resources common stock on December 8, 2011, plus $21.20.
 
The pro forma adjustments included in the pro forma financial statements are as follows:
Adjustments to Pro Forma Financial Statements
(a)   Based on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Statements of Financial Position of AGL Resources and Nicor, certain financial line items included in Nicors historical presentation have been reclassified to corresponding line items included in AGL Resources historical presentation. These reclassifications have no material impact on the historical operating income, net income, earnings available to parent, total assets, liabilities or shareholders equity reported by AGL Resources or Nicor.
AGL Resources and Nicor historical presentation
 
Additionally, based on AGL Resources review of Nicors summary of significant accounting policies disclosed in Nicors financial statements and preliminary discussions with Nicor management, the nature and amount of any adjustments to the historical financial statements of Nicor to conform its accounting policies to those of AGL Resources are not expected to be material. Further review of Nicors accounting policies and financial statements may result in revisions to Nicors policies and classifications to conform to AGL Resources, some of which may be material.
 
The allocation of the preliminary purchase price to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed includes pro forma adjustments for the fair value of Nicors assets and liabilities. The final allocation of the purchase price could differ materially from the preliminary allocation used for the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The allocation of the preliminary purchase price is as follows (in millions):
 
 
Adjustments to Pro Forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Statements of Income
 
(b)   Represents a decrease in operation and maintenance expense by removing the non-recurring transaction costs incurred by AGL Resources and Nicor through September 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010.
Operation and maintenance
(c)   Represents the net incremental depreciation expense and incremental amortization of identified intangibles resulting from the pro forma fair value adjustments to Nicors unregulated property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The estimates are preliminary, subject to change and could vary materially from the actual adjustment.
Provision for depreciation and amortization,
net
(d)   Represents an increase in interest expense as the result of AGL Resources debt issuances to make a cash payment of $998 million to fund the requirement to pay $21.20 for each outstanding common share of Nicor and to settle the additional shares outstanding under Nicors stock compensation plans.
Interest expense
 
(e)   Represents the adjustment to the income tax expense to reflect a combined consolidated estimated statutory income tax rate of 37%.
Income taxes
 
(f)   Reflects the elimination of Nicors common stock offset by issuance of approximately 38.1 million shares of AGL Resources common stock. This share issuance does not consider that fractional shares will be paid in cash. The pro forma weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding is calculated by adding AGL Resources weighted-average number of basic shares of common stock outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, and the year ended December 31, 2010, to the number of AGL Resources shares issued as a result of the merger. The pro forma weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding is calculated by adding AGL Resources weighted-average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, and the year ended December 31, 2010, to the number of AGL Resources shares issued as a result of the merger.
Shares outstanding
 
Adjustments to Pro Forma Condensed Combined Consolidated Balance Sheet
 
(g)   Reflects a $6 million increase to record Nicors unregulated property, plant and equipment to the estimated fair value. The estimate is preliminary, subject to change and could vary materially from the actual adjustment.
Property, Plant and Equipment
 
(h)   Reflects the preliminary estimate of the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of Nicors assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary purchase price of the transaction, based on the volume-weighted average price of AGL Resources common stock on the NYSE on December 8, 2011, and the excess purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is calculated as follows (in millions):
Goodwill
 
(i)   Represents the estimated fair value adjustment of $121 million, based on prevailing market prices at September 30, 2011, associated with AGL Resources assuming Nicors debt.
Regulatory assets
(j)   Represents (i) the estimated fair value adjustment of $146 million associated with customer relationships and trade names of Nicor, (ii) the estimated fair value adjustment of $13 million related to investments in equity method joint ventures and (iii) the estimated debt issuance costs of $2 million. The customer relationships and trade names are expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated remaining useful lives, while the debt issuance costs are expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the various debt instruments. The estimated lives of these assets are as follows:
Other assets
(k)   Reflects the accrual for estimated non-recurring transaction costs of $41 million to be incurred after September 30, 2011, partially offset by the current portion of income tax expense of $5 million.
Accrued expenses
             
(l) 
Debt
  In connection with the merger agreement, AGL Resources assumed all of Nicors outstanding debt. The pro forma adjustment to short-term debt reflects the re-issuance of $700 million of commercial paper which was previously repaid as a result of our 2011 debt financings and $23 million of commercial paper borrowings necessary to complete the payment of the cash portion of the purchase consideration, less the $145 million adjustment to reduce AGL Resources cash balance to an amount that would have been  maintained if the merger-related financing was not secured prior to the balance sheet date. The pro forma adjustment to long-term debt reflects the issuance of $975 million of debt by AGL Resources, less approximately $700 million that had been secured as of September 30, 2011 that was used to help finance the merger, and the fair value adjustment of Nicors debt based on prevailing market prices at September 30, 2011 of $121 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2011, AGL Resources completed an issuance of $275 million in senior unsecured notes with various institutional investors in the private placement market.
 
(m)   Represents the estimated deferred tax liability, based on AGL Resources estimated post-merger composite statutory tax rate of 37% multiplied by the fair value adjustments recorded to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, excluding goodwill. This estimated tax rate is different from AGL Resources effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, which includes other tax charges or benefits, and does not take into account any historical or possible future tax events that may impact the combined company.
Accumulated deferred income taxes
(n)   The pro forma balance sheet reflects the elimination of Nicors historical equity balance, recognition of additional 38.1 million AGL Resources common shares issued and adjustment to reduce retained earnings by $24 million (net of tax) for the remaining estimated non-recurring transaction costs. These transaction costs are shown as an adjustment to retained earnings to reflect the impact of accounting guidance applicable to business combinations, which requires that these costs be expensed. Estimated transaction costs have been excluded from the pro forma income statements as they reflect non-recurring charges directly related to the merger.
