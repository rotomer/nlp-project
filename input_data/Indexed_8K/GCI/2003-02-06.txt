Press Release dated February 6, 2003

Exhibit 99.1 Thursday, February 6, 2003 Gannett Co., Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter And 2002 Full-Year Results McLEAN, VA Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2002 fourth quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were $1.29 versus 93 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2001, a 39 percent increase. For the full year 2002, diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, were $4.31, a 38 percent increase over the $3.12 for 2001. Net income increased 40 percent to $347 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 versus $248.4 million in the same quarter of last year. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) rose 14 percent to $624.6 million in 2002's fourth quarter from $547.3 million in the year earlier quarter, reflecting very strong television results and another quarter of improved newspaper performance. Total operating revenues for the company increased 7 percent to $1.73 billion in the quarter from $1.61 billion in the similar interval in 2001. For the full year net income rose 40 percent to $1.16 billion from $831.2 million in 2001. Operating cash flow rose 6 percent to $2.1 billion from $2.0 billion in 2001. Operating revenues increased 2 percent to $6.42 billion for the year. If SFAS No. 142 (which changes the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets) had been in effect for all of 2001, defined as "comparable basis," earnings per diluted share would have increased 13 percent for the quarter from $1.14 in 2001 to $1.29 in 2002. For the full year, earnings per diluted share would have risen 10 percent to $4.31 from $3.92. On a comparable basis, operating income for the fourth quarter would have been up 14 percent from last year's $498.3 million. Net income would have increased 14 percent from $305.5 million to $347 million in the fourth quarter and 11 percent, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, for the full year on a comparable basis. Included in the press release are "comparable basis" schedules detailing fourth quarter and full year results for 2001 as if SFAS No. 142 had been adopted at the beginning of 2001. Average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter totaled 269,799,000 compared with 267,352,000 in 2001's fourth quarter. Average diluted shares outstanding for all of 2002 were 269,286,000 versus 266,833,000 in 2001. Commenting on the company's performance, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO, said: "We are very pleased to report another quarter of strong year-over-year earnings growth led by robust television results and another solid performance by our newspaper operations. Our television properties achieved strong year-over-year gains propelled by record political advertising spending and a continued favorable advertising environment for our highly rated television stations. Our newspaper operations reported their best quarter of revenue and operating cash flow gains all year. Newsprint expense declined 13 percent for the quarter. In the UK, our Newsquest properties achieved their strongest advertising revenue gains all year in the fourth quarter and made a strong contribution to earnings." NEWSPAPERS Total newspaper segment operating cash flow increased 8 percent to $506.3 million in the fourth quarter, versus $468.8 million in the same quarter of 2001. Operating revenues were $1.5 billion for the quarter. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of newspapers in both the fourth quarter of this year and last year, advertising revenues would have risen 4 percent. On the same basis, local advertising revenues were 3 percent higher, classified increased 6 percent and national revenues rose 5 percent. Newspaper ad volume increased 4 percent. Reported newsprint expense declined in the quarter, reflecting substantially lower year-over-year prices but a small uptick in consumption. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues increased 2 percent in the fourth quarter, the first year-over-year gain in advertising revenues since the fourth quarter of 2000. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,438 compared with 1,512 in the same quarter of 2001. For the full year, USA TODAY's advertising revenues declined 6 percent to $314 million and paid pages totaled 4,869, an 11 percent decline. TELEVISION In the fourth quarter of 2002, television operating cash flow jumped 41 percent to $128.7 million from $91.2 million in the year earlier quarter. Television revenues rose 27 percent to $228.8 million reflecting record political advertising and solid growth in other categories. At the end of the year, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In December, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was 11.8 million unique visitors reaching about 9 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//Net Ratings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the United Kingdom where its network of Web sites attracts more than 14.3 million monthly page impressions from more than 1.1 million unique users. For the year, the company generated approximately $91 million of revenues from Internet activities, about a 27 percent increase over last year.
