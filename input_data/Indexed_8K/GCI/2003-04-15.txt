News Release
Tuesday, April 15, 2003
MCLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2003 first quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were 93 cents versus 91 cents for the first quarter of 2002. The company achieved another quarter of positive earnings growth but results were hampered by the effects of the war in Iraq on advertising demand late in the quarter.
Total operating revenues for the company increased 3 percent to $1.55 billion from $1.51 billion in the same quarter last year. Net income rose 3 percent to $249.8 million versus $243.6 million in 2002's first quarter. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) increased to $467.1 million from $457.7 million for the year earlier quarter, reflecting another quarter of improved newspaper segment performance.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter totaled 270,059,000 compared with 268,546,000 in 2002's first quarter.
Commenting on the company's results, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO said: "We are pleased to report another quarter of year-over-year earnings growth led by the performance of our newspaper operations. The quarter started out strong but results, particularly at our television stations and USA TODAY, were depressed by the reluctance of advertisers to spend in an uncertain geopolitical environment. Television results also were affected by the absence of Winter Olympic-related ad spending. In the UK, Newsquest made another solid contribution to cash flow and earnings despite a muted advertising environment.
"While results were held back in the short-term, the extraordinary work our journalists have done during this period has clearly underscored the importance of our industry. The war has been experienced with unprecedented closeness, only because of the courage and tenacity of reporters, photographers and editors. We applaud their efforts," McCorkindale said.
Total newspaper segment operating cash flow, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, rose 5 percent to $408.1 million, versus $389.9 million in the same quarter of 2002. Operating revenues were $1.39 billion for the quarter.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues increased 1 percent in the quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,096 compared with 1,178 in 2002's first quarter. USA TODAY's results in the quarter reflected substantially diminished demand for travel-related advertising as a result of the uncertain geopolitical situation.
In the first quarter, television revenues declined 5 percent to $158.2 million from $167.2 million in the corresponding interval in 2002. Television operating cash flow trailed year ago results and was $70.5 million in the quarter. The absence of Winter Olympic-related advertising on our thirteen NBC-affiliated stations was further exacerbated by reduced demand for advertising due to the outbreak of hostilities.
The company's interest expense was $36.1 million in the quarter, up from $28.8 million in the first quarter of 2002, reflecting higher rates partially offset by lower debt levels. In March 2002 the company refinanced $1.8 billion in commercial paper obligations with the issuance of fixed rate unsecured global notes.
During the first quarter the company completed a non-monetary transaction under which it contributed its newspaper in El Paso to a newly formed partnership, Texas-New Mexico Newspaper Partnership. The company recorded this non-monetary transaction as two simultaneous but separate events; that is, a sale of 34 percent of its interest in the El Paso newspaper for which a non-operating gain was recognized, and the acquisition of a 66 percent interest in the partnership. The non-monetary gain from the partnership transaction is reflected in non-operating income and was partially offset by other non-operating charges, including those for write-down of minority interest investments in internet businesses.
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In February, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was 12 million unique visitors reaching about 10 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the United Kingdom where its network of web sites attracts more than 15.8 million monthly page impressions from more than 1.3 million unique users.
Subsequent to quarter end, Gannett UK, the parent company of Newsquest, completed the acquisition of the publishing business of SMG.
All references in this release and attachments to "operating cash flow" are to a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that use of this measure allows investors and management to analyze and compare the company's performance in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's consolidated statements of income is presented on an attachment.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tuesday, April 15, 2003
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the third period ended March 30, 2003 increased 1 percent. Results in March, particularly in the last half of the month, were hampered by the war in Iraq.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in March were up 2 percent compared with the same period in 2002 on flat ROP volume and an 11 percent advance in preprint distribution.
Pro forma classified revenues increased 5 percent in the March period on a 3 percent increase in ad volume. Employment revenues declined 1 percent from the same period last year. Classified real estate revenues advanced 16 percent, and automotive increased 1 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues increased modestly in the March period on a 5 percent decline in ad volume. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers.
Pro forma national advertising revenues fell 3 percent on a 1 percent decline in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers was down slightly in the period compared with the same interval in 2002. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues declined 10 percent on a 17 percent decrease in paid ad pages to 329 from 396. Travel advertising demand at USA TODAY was particularly hard hit by the onset of hostilities. For the year-to-date, USA TODAY's paid pages numbered 1,096 versus 1,178 last year while ad revenues were 1 percent higher.
Television revenues declined 5 percent in the period. National revenues fell 8 percent and local revenues decreased 3 percent. Television revenues were also unfavorably affected by the war.
Pro forma other revenues, which primarily include Gannett's share of the operating results of the Detroit and Tucson joint operating agencies and the company's commercial printing activities, rose 2 percent.
Ad linage for Newsquest is not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics.
Gannett Co., Inc. is a leading international news and information company that publishes 100 daily newspapers in the USA, including USA TODAY, the nation's largest-selling daily newspaper.
