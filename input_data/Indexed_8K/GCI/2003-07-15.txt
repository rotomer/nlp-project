News Release
Tuesday, July 15, 2003
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2003 second quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were $1.20 versus $1.13 for the second quarter of 2002, a 6 percent increase. Another quarter of positive earnings growth was achieved by the company despite the effects of the war in Iraq early in the quarter and a continued sluggish economy.
Diluted earnings per share for the first six months of 2003 were $2.12 compared with $2.04 for the same interval in 2002.
Total operating revenues for the second quarter increased 6 percent to $1.71 billion from $1.61 billion in the same quarter last year. Net income rose 7 percent to $324.3 million versus $303.9 million in 2002's second quarter. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) increased to $585.4 million from $559.4 million for the second quarter of 2002, a 5 percent increase.
For the first six months of 2003, total revenues increased 4 percent to $3.26 billion. Net income rose 5 percent to $574.1 million from $547.5 million and operating cash flow advanced 3 percent to $1.05 billion.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter totaled 271,281,000 compared with 269,473,000 in 2002's second quarter.
Commenting on the company's results, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO said: "Gannett continues to deliver solid earnings growth despite an uneven and tentative economic environment. Our newspaper operations, particularly the strong performance of the Newsquest team in the UK, bolstered our results in the quarter. The television group posted year-over-year gains in revenue, operating income and cash flow even with reduced political advertising. Lower interest expense and a favorable foreign exchange rate also contributed to earnings growth."
Newspaper results in the quarter include the SMG (Scottish Media Group) publishing business and the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership. Total newspaper operating revenues, which include USA TODAY and our UK properties, increased 6 percent to $1.51 billion in the second quarter, versus $1.42 billion in the same quarter of 2002. Operating cash flow rose 5 percent to $495.3 million. Newsprint expense increased 10 percent, reflecting higher year-over-year prices and increased consumption due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were almost even with last year's second quarter results despite substantially lower demand for travel related advertising. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,220 compared with 1,236 in the same quarter of 2002, a 1 percent decline. For the year-to-date, USA TODAY's advertising revenues were slightly ahead of last year and paid pages numbered 2,316 compared with 2,414 last year, a 4 percent decline. USA TODAY's results in the quarter benefited from strong automotive, technology and entertainment advertising.
In the second quarter, television revenues increased 1 percent to $192.7 million from $191.3 million in the corresponding period in 2002. Television operating income and cash flow each advanced 1 percent and were $95.6 million and $102.2 million, respectively, in the quarter. These positive results were achieved at a time when demand for advertising was affected by the war and diminished political spending.
Interest expense for the second quarter was $36.3 million, down from $41.1 million in the same quarter of 2002. Other non-operating income reflects investment and currency gains which offset other non-operating charges, including those for the write-down of minority interest investments in internet businesses.
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In May, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was 13 million unique visitors reaching about 10 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//Net Ratings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracts more than 15.9 million monthly page impressions from almost 1.7 million unique users.
All references in this release and attachments to "operating cash flow" are to a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that use of this measure allows investors and management to analyze and compare the company's performance in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

News Release
Tuesday, July 15, 2003
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the sixth period ended June 29, 2003 increased 3 percent. For comparison purposes, the continued increase in the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have increased 1 percent.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in June were up 5 percent compared with the same period in 2002 on a 2 percent increase in ROP volume and a 9 percent advance in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have risen 3 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues advanced 7 percent in the June period on a 3 percent increase in ad volume. Employment revenues declined 3 percent from the same period last year. Classified real estate revenues advanced 16 percent, and automotive increased 6 percent. Overall, the company's classified results from Newsquest were substantially stronger than its domestic results.
Pro forma local advertising revenues rose 4 percent in the June period on a 1 percent decline in ad volume. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., newspaper gains were achieved in the telecommunications, financial and home improvement categories while there was softness in department stores, consumer electronics, furniture and grocery ad spending.
Pro forma national advertising revenues increased 2 percent on a 15 percent increase in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers rose 19 percent in the period compared with the same interval in 2002. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 1 percent lower on a 2 percent decrease in paid ad pages to 408 from 418. For the month, automotive, technology and advocacy advertising were strong but soft travel and retail advertising offset these gains. For the year-to-date, USA TODAY's paid pages numbered 2,316 versus 2,414 last year while ad revenues were slightly ahead of last year.
Television revenues declined 4 percent in the period. Local revenues rose 4 percent while national revenues declined 14 percent. For comparison purposes, television revenues increased 16 percent in June of 2002.
In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share for May from Nielsen//Net Ratings. In May, Gannett's domestic Websites had over 13 million unique visitors reaching 10 percent of the Internet audience.
The pro forma advertising and circulation revenue statistics include the results of the SMG (Scottish Media Group) publishing business and Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership as if they had been owned in both years. Ad linage for Newsquest is not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics.
