News Release
Tuesday, October 14, 2003
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2003 third quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were $1.03 versus 99 cents for the third quarter of 2002, a new record.
Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2003 were $3.15 compared with $3.02 for the same interval in 2002, also a new record.
Net income rose 5 percent to $279.0 million versus $265.6 million in 2002's third quarter. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) increased 3 percent to $523.0 million in 2003's third quarter from $507.1 million in the year earlier quarter. Total operating revenues advanced 4 percent to $1.63 billion in the third quarter.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter totaled 272,174,000 compared with 269,306,000 in 2002's third quarter.
For the first nine months of 2003, net income increased 5 percent to $853.2 million from $813.1 million and operating cash flow rose 3 percent to $1.58 billion. Total operating revenues advanced 4 percent to $4.89 billion from $4.70 billion.
Commenting on the company's performance, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO said: "Gannett achieved record earnings in the quarter despite substantially reduced political advertising on our television stations, and an uneven economy. Our newspaper operations posted solid year-over-year gains in advertising revenues and operating cash flow in the third quarter. Overseas, our Newsquest team made another strong contribution to operating results. A decline in interest expense and a favorable currency exchange rate also contributed to earnings growth."
Newspaper results in the quarter include the SMG (Scottish Media Group) publishing business and the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership. Total newspaper operating revenues, which include USA TODAY and our UK businesses, advanced to $1.46 billion in the third quarter versus $1.39 billion in the same interval in 2002, a 5 percent increase. Operating cash flow increased 6 percent to $455.4 million. Newsprint expense increased 12 percent as a result of higher year-over-year prices and increased consumption due to the previously mentioned acquisitions.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 5 percent higher in 2003's third quarter than in the third quarter of 2002. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,023 compared with 1,017 last year. For the year-to-date, USA TODAY's advertising revenues advanced 2 percent while paid pages numbered 3,338 versus 3,431 last year, a 3 percent decline. USA TODAY's improved results in the quarter reflected greater demand for travel, telecommunications, retail and pharmaceutical related advertising.
      In the third quarter, television revenues declined 6 percent to $172.3 million from $184.0 million in the corresponding interval of 2002, reflecting significantly diminished political advertising. Television operating income and cash flow lagged the prior year's quarter and were $72.6 million and $79.3 million, respectively.
Interest expense for the third quarter declined 15 percent to $33.9 million from $39.7 million in the prior year's third quarter. Other non-operating expense primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interest and Internet investments, partially offset by investment income and currency gains.
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In August, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was 14.2 million unique visitors reaching over 10 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//Net Ratings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracts more than 16.5 million monthly page impressions from almost 1.7 million unique users.
All references in this release and attachments to "operating cash flow" are to a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that use of this measure allows investors and management to analyze and compare the company's performance in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

News Release
Tuesday, October 14, 2003
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the ninth period ended September 28, 2003 increased 2 percent.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in September rose 5 percent compared with the same period in 2002 on a 1 percent increase in ROP volume and a 10 percent advance in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have risen 4 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues increased 6 percent in the September period on a 4 percent increase in ad volume. Employment revenues declined 1 percent from the same period last year. Classified real estate revenues increased 9 percent, and automotive rose 2 percent. Overall, the company's classified results from Newsquest were stronger than its domestic results. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have increased 5 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues rose 1 percent in the ninth period on a 4 percent decline in ad volume. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., local ad revenue gains were achieved in the entertainment and financial categories while there was softness in department stores and consumer electronics.
Pro forma national advertising revenues increased 9 percent on a 7 percent increase in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers rose 6 percent in the period compared with the same interval in 2002. USA WEEKEND, our weekly newspaper magazine, and our Newsquest properties experienced lower national ad revenues during the period. While our revenue statistics include their results, USA WEEKEND and Newsquest's ad volume is not included in the linage numbers. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 15 percent higher on a 12 percent increase in paid ad pages to 386 from 346. For the month, at USA TODAY, travel, entertainment, telecommunications and pharmaceutical advertising were strong. For the year-to-date, USA TODAY's paid pages numbered 3,338 versus 3,431 last year while ad revenues were 2 percent higher than last year.
Television revenues declined 8 percent in the period reflecting substantially diminished political advertising. Local revenues rose 1 percent while national revenues fell 20 percent. For comparison purposes, television revenues increased 41 percent in September of 2002.
In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share for August from Nielsen//Net Ratings. In August, Gannett's domestic Websites had over 14 million unique visitors reaching 10.4 percent of the Internet audience.
The pro forma advertising and circulation revenue statistics include the results of the SMG (Newsquest's Scottish Media Group) publishing business and Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership as if they had been owned in both years. Ad linage for Newsquest is not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics.
Gannett Co., Inc. is a leading international news and information company that publishes 100 daily newspapers in the USA, including USA TODAY, the nation's largest-selling daily newspaper. The company also owns almost 500 non-daily publications in the USA and USA WEEKEND, a weekly newspaper magazine.
