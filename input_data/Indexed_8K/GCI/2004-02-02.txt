News Release
Monday, February 2, 2004
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2003 fourth quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were $1.31 versus $1.29 per share for the fourth quarter of 2002, a new record. For the full year 2003, diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, were $4.46, compared with $4.31 for 2002, also a new record.
Total operating revenues for the company increased 6 percent to $1.82 billion in the quarter from $1.73 billion in the similar interval in 2002. Net income increased 3 percent to $358.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 versus $347.0 million in the same quarter of last year. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) rose 2 percent to $637.1 million in the quarter from $624.6 million in the year earlier quarter.
Operating revenues increased 4 percent to $6.7 billion for the year. For the full year, net income rose 4 percent to a record $1.21 billion from $1.16 billion in 2002. Operating cash flow advanced 3 percent to $2.2 billion from $2.1 billion in 2002.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter totaled 274,257,000 compared with 269,799,000 in 2002's fourth quarter. Average diluted shares outstanding for all of 2003 were 271,872,000 versus 269,286,000 in 2002.
Commenting on the company's performance, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO said; "We are very pleased to report another quarter and year of record revenues, earnings and operating cash flow. These strong results were achieved for 2003 despite significantly reduced political and Olympic ad spending that bolstered our television stations in 2002. Our newspaper operations reported their best results of the year in the fourth quarter against a backdrop of continued subdued advertising demand. In the UK, our Newsquest properties also achieved their strongest advertising revenue gains in the fourth quarter and made another strong contribution to earnings for the quarter, and all of 2003. Gannett's newspapers, in fact, have delivered some of the best ad revenue growth numbers in the industry all year long. A favorable currency exchange rate and a decline in interest expense also helped our results."
Newspaper results in the quarter include the SMG Publishing business, The Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership, and Clipper Magazine, Inc. acquired in late October.
Total newspaper segment operating cash flow increased 7 percent to $544.2 million in the fourth quarter, versus $506.3 million in the same quarter of 2002. Operating revenues were $1.63 billion for the quarter. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of newspapers in both the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002, advertising revenues would have risen 6 percent. On the same basis, local advertising revenues were 4 percent higher, classified increased 8 percent and national revenues jumped 11 percent. Newspaper ad volume increased 1 percent. Reported newsprint expense increased in the quarter, reflecting higher year-over-year prices and increased consumption due primarily to the aforementioned acquisitions and growth in our commercial printing activities.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues increased 10 percent in the fourth quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,580 compared with 1,438 in the same quarter of 2002. For the full year, USA TODAY's advertising revenues increased 4 percent and paid pages totaled 4,918, a 1 percent increase.
In the fourth quarter of 2003, television operating cash flow fell 19 percent to $104.4 million from $128.7 million in the year earlier quarter. Television revenues declined 14 percent to $196.7 million reflecting substantially reduced political advertising in the quarter.
Interest expense for the fourth quarter declined 10 percent to $33.0 million from $36.8 million in the same quarter of 2002. Other non-operating expense primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interest and Internet investments in part offset by currency gains and investment income.
At the end of the year, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In December, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was 14.8 million unique visitors reaching about 10 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracts more than 25.7 million monthly page impressions from more than 2.9 million unique users.
Subsequent to the close of the quarter, the Company provided notice to The E.W. Scripps Company, as required under the terms of the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) involving The Cincinnati Enquirer, The Cincinnati Post and The Kentucky Post, that the JOA would not be renewed when it expires on December 31, 2007.
All references in this release to "comparable" financial results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONGannett Co., Inc. and SubsidiariesUnaudited, in thousands of dollars"Operating Cash Flow", a non-GAAP measure, is defined as operatingincome plus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.Management believes that the use of this measure allows investors andmanagement to measure, analyze and compare the cash resourcesgenerated from its business segment operations in a meaningful andconsistent manner. The focus on operating cash flow is appropriategiven the consistent and generally predictable strength of cash flowgeneration by newspaper and television operations, and the shortperiod of time it takes to convert new orders to cash.A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's operatingincome, which the company believes is the most directly comparablefinancial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP onthe company's consolidated statements of income, follows:Thirteen weeks ended December 28, 2003                   Newspaper                            Consolidated                  Publishing   Television   Corporate      Total                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating cash flow        $  544,249   $  104,427   $ (11,620)  $    637,056Less:Depreciation         (45,253)      (6,537)     (3,712)       (55,502)Amortization          (2,133)          -           -          (2,133)                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating Income  $  496,863   $   97,890   $ (15,332)  $    579,421                  ==========   ==========   =========   ============Thirteen weeks ended December 29, 2002                   Newspaper                            Consolidated                  Publishing   Television   Corporate      Total                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating cash flow        $  506,305   $  128,675   $ (10,401)  $    624,579Less:Depreciation         (43,037)      (6,281)     (4,496)       (53,814)Amortization          (1,830)          -           -          (1,830)                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating Income  $  461,438   $  122,394   $ (14,897)  $    568,935                  ==========   ==========   =========   ============Fifty-two weeks ended December 28, 2003                   Newspaper                            Consolidated                  Publishing   Television   Corporate      Total                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating cash flow        $1,902,968   $  356,448   $ (46,866)  $  2,212,550Less:Depreciation        (181,534)     (26,394)    (15,333)      (223,261)Amortization          (8,271)          -           -          (8,271)                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating Income  $1,713,163   $  330,054   $ (62,199)  $  1,981,018                  ==========   ==========   =========   ============Fifty-two weeks ended December 29, 2002                   Newspaper                            Consolidated                  Publishing   Television   Corporate      Total                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating cash flow        $1,797,333   $  396,561   $ (45,141)  $  2,148,753Less:Depreciation        (174,342)     (25,429)    (15,346)      (215,117)Amortization          (7,327)          -           -          (7,327)                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating Income  $1,615,664   $  371,132   $ (60,487)  $  1,926,309                  ==========   ==========   =========   ============

News Release
Monday, February 2, 2004
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the twelfth period ended December 28, 2003 were 5 percent above the same period last year. For comparison purposes, the continued increase in the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have increased 4 percent.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in December rose 7 percent compared with the same period in 2002 on a 1 percent increase in ROP volume and an 8 percent advance in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have risen 5 percent. For the full-year, pro forma newspaper advertising revenues were up 5 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues increased 9 percent in the December period on a 3 percent increase in ad volume. Employment revenues increased 8 percent from the same period last year, including an almost 4 percent increase at our local domestic newspapers. On a constant currency basis, employment revenue would have increased 4 percent. Classified real estate revenues increased 14 percent and automotive fell 2 percent. Overall, the company's classified results from Newsquest were stronger than its domestic results. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have increased 7 percent. For all of 2003, pro forma classified revenues increased 5 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues rose 4 percent in the twelfth period on a 3 percent decline in ad volume. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., local ROP ad revenue gains were achieved in the financial, home improvement and telecommunications categories while there was continued softness in department stores and consumer electronics. For the full year, pro forma local ad revenues increased 3 percent.
Pro forma national advertising revenues increased 12 percent on a 10 percent increase in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers rose 11 percent in the period compared with the same interval in 2002. For all of 2003, pro forma national advertising rose 6 percent.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues for the twelfth period were 6 percent higher and paid ad pages increased to 526 from 484. For the twelfth period, at USA TODAY, travel, retail and telecommunications were strong and more than offset lower entertainment and technology spending. For the year, USA TODAY's paid pages numbered 4,918 versus 4,869 last year while ad revenues were 4 percent higher than last year.
Television revenues declined 2 percent in the period. National revenues fell 10 percent while local revenues increased 2 percent. For comparison purposes, television revenues rose 13 percent in the same period last year. Based on current pacings, television revenues are currently ahead of last year's first quarter results in the low single digits. Television revenues decreased 7 percent for the full year reflecting the absence of Olympic-related ad revenues and substantially diminished political advertising.
In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share for December from Nielsen//Net Ratings. In December, Gannett's domestic Websites had 14.8 million unique visitors reaching about 10 percent of the Internet audience.
The pro forma advertising and circulation revenue statistics include the results of the SMG (Newsquest's Scottish Media Group) publishing business, Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership and Clipper Magazine as if they had been owned in both years. Ad linage for Newsquest and Clipper are not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics.
