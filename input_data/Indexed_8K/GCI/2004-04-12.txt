News Release
Monday, April 12, 2004
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2004 first quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were $1.00 versus 93 cents for the first quarter of 2003, a new record. The company achieved strong earnings growth as advertising demand accelerated late in the quarter across the company.
Total operating revenues for the company totaled $1.73 billion for the quarter compared to $1.55 billion for the same period last year, an 11.4 percent increase. Net income rose 9.8 percent to $274.4 million versus $249.8 million in 2003's first quarter. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) increased to $507.2 million from $467.1 million for the same quarter a year ago.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter totaled 275,507,000 compared with 270,059,000 in 2003's first quarter. Approximately 1.0 million shares were repurchased since the company announced the reactivation of its share repurchase program on February 9, 2004.
Commenting on the company's results, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO said: "We are pleased to report another quarter of record revenues, earnings and operating cash flow, with each of our operating divisions posting improved results for the quarter. Newspaper segment results reflected stronger advertising revenue growth and the benefit of acquisitions tempered by higher newsprint and benefit costs. Our Newsquest properties in the UK, also reflecting an improving advertising climate and favorable exchange rate, added significantly to our results. The television group achieved improved operating results year-over-year benefiting, in part, from politically-related advertising demand."
Newspaper results in the quarter include the SMG Publishing business, the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership, Clipper Magazine, Inc., and NurseWeek acquired in February 2004.
Total newspaper segment operating cash flow, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, rose 8.5 percent to $442.8 million, versus $408.1 million in the same quarter of 2003. Operating revenues were $1.56 billion for the quarter, an 11.9 percent increase year-over-year. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of properties in the first quarter of both 2004 and 2003, advertising revenues would have increased 9.4 percent. On the same basis, classified advertising grew 12.6 percent, national revenues advanced 10.5 percent and local advertising revenues increased 6.0 percent. Reported newsprint expense increased 13 percent due to higher usage related to acquisitions and higher year-over-year prices.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues increased 10.0 percent in the first quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,099 compared with 1,096 in 2003's first quarter.
In the first quarter, television operating cash flow increased 9.2 percent to $77.0 million from $70.5 million in the corresponding interval in 2003. Television revenues increased 7.1 percent to $169.5 million from $158.2 million in the same quarter in 2003.
The company's interest expense was $31.8 million in the quarter, down from $36.1 million in the first quarter of 2003, reflecting lower debt levels and lower short term interest rates.
During the first quarter, the company exchanged its daily newspaper in Gainesville, Georgia for two daily and three non-daily publications in Tennessee. The company recorded a non-monetary gain from the exchange which is reflected in non-operating income and was partially offset by other non-operating charges for minority interest and Internet investments.
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In February, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was over 19 million unique visitors reaching almost 13 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the United Kingdom.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter the company completed the acquisition of the assets of Captivate Network Inc., a national news and entertainment network that delivers quality programming and advertising on television screens in elevators in premier office towers across North America.
All references in this release and attachments to "operating cash flow" are to a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that use of this measure allows investors and management to analyze and compare the company's performance in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's consolidated statements of income is presented on an attachment.

News Release
Monday, April 12, 2004
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the third period ended March 28, 2004 increased 10.2 percent, benefiting from improved advertising demand, particularly in classified and stronger television advertising revenues. For comparison purposes, the continued increase in the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have increased 7.2 percent.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in March were up 13.5 percent compared with 2003's third period on a 4.4 percent advance in ROP volume and a 4.8 percent increase in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have risen 9.9 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues increased 16.1 percent in the third period on a 5.1 percent increase in ROP ad volume. Employment revenues increased 22.9 percent compared to the third period last year. Classified real estate revenues advanced 12.8 percent and automotive rose 8.8 percent. On a constant currency basis, employment revenues would have increased 15.3 percent, real estate revenues 6.5 percent and automotive 5.4 percent. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have increased 10.2 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues increased 8.6 percent on a 2.2 percent increase in ROP ad volume. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., local ad revenue gains, across all products, were achieved in almost all categories except department stores and consumer electronics. On a constant currency basis, pro forma local advertising would have increased 6.7 percent.
Pro forma national advertising revenues rose 20.0 percent on a 13.7 percent increase in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers advanced 13.9 percent in the period compared with the same period in 2003. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were up 24.9 percent on a 15.8 percent increase in paid ad pages to 381 from 329. USA TODAY's year-to-date paid pages totaled 1,099 compared to 1,096 for the prior year while ad revenues were 10.0 percent higher. For the third period, at USA TODAY, results were better for nearly every advertising category. The travel, retail, telecommunications, financial and advocacy categories were particularly strong.
Pro forma television revenues increased 11.2 percent in the period. Local revenues increased 10.6 percent and national revenues increased 14.6 percent. Based on current pacings, television revenues are ahead of last year's second quarter results in the high single digits.
The pro forma advertising and circulation revenue statistics include the results of NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004), Clipper Magazine (acquired in October 2003), the SMG (Newsquest's Scottish Media Group) publishing business and the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership as if they had been owned in both years. Ad linage for Newsquest, Clipper and NurseWeek are not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics.
Prior to 2004, the company had included online revenues in the classified advertising revenue total but not in the specific classified categories of help wanted, automotive and real estate. Print and online ad revenues are now reported on a combined basis to calculate the percentage changes in these categories. Results for each period of 2003 have been reclassified to reflect this change.
Gannett Co., Inc. is a leading international news and information company that publishes 101 daily newspapers in the USA, including USA TODAY, the nation's largest-selling daily newspaper. The company also owns more than 500 non-daily publications in the USA and USA WEEKEND, a weekly newspaper magazine.

Advertising linage statistics from these newspapers are not       included above, however, circulation volume statistics for these       newspapers are included above.       The above revenue amounts and statistics have been restated to include       all companies presently owned including NurseWeek (acquired in February       2004), Clipper Magazine (acquired in late October 2003), SMG Publishing       (acquired in April 2003) and 100% of the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers       Partnership (established in March 2003). NurseWeek is a multimedia       company with print publications focused on the recruitment, recognition       and education of nurses. Clipper Magazine is a direct-mail advertising       magazine company publishing over 325 individual market editions in 24       states, which are mailed to over 100 million American homes annually.       SMG Publishing consists of three Scottish newspapers: The Herald, Sunday       Herald and Evening Times; eleven specialty consumer and business-to-       business magazine titles; and an online advertising and content       business.       Newsquest (which includes SMG Publishing) is a regional newspaper       publisher in the United Kingdom with more than 300 titles, including       paid and unpaid daily and non-daily products. Circulation volume       statistics for Newsquest's seventeen paid daily newspapers are included       above. Circulation volume statistics for Newsquest's unpaid daily and       non-daily publications are not reflected above. Advertising linage for       Newsquest publications is not reflected above.       Circulation volume and advertising linage statistics for non-daily       products, including NurseWeek and Clipper Magazine are not reflected       above.       Certain online advertising revenues in 2003 have been reclassified to       conform with the 2004 presentation. There was no effect on total       revenues.
