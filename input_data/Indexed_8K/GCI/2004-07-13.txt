News Release
Tuesday, July 13, 2004
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2004 second quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were $1.30 versus $1.20 for the second quarter of 2003, an 8.3 percent increase. The company's record results reflected increased advertising demand for all of its operating divisions.
Diluted earnings per share for the first six months of 2004 were $2.29 compared with $2.12 for the same interval in 2003.
Total operating revenues for the company were $1.87 billion for the second quarter compared to $1.71 billion for the same period last year, a 9.9 percent increase. Net income rose 9.3 percent to $354.4 million versus $324.3 million in 2003's second quarter. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) increased to $638.5 million from $585.4 million for the same quarter a year ago.
For the first six months of 2004, total revenues were $3.60 billion, a 10.6 percent increase. Net income rose 9.5 percent to $628.8 million from $574.1 million and operating cash flow rose 8.9 percent to $1.15 billion.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter totaled 273,541,000 compared with 271,281,000 in 2003's second quarter. Approximately 5.3 million shares were repurchased during the quarter. The company also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $1.0 billion of its common stock. Prior to today's action, a substantial portion of the $500 million authorized for repurchase under the program announced on May 12, 2004 had been used.
Commenting on the company's results, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO said: "We are pleased to again report record operating results in the face of an uneven economic recovery. Our newspaper segment produced industry leading ad revenue growth, benefiting particularly from strong growth in classified employment advertising, and acquisitions. Higher newsprint and certain employee benefit costs, however, continue to impact expenses. Our UK operations again made a strong contribution to earnings as demand for advertising in the UK continues to improve. We also benefited from a favorable exchange rate. The Broadcast segment achieved solid results reflecting, in part, an increase in political advertising demand."
Newspaper segment results in the quarter and year-to-date include the SMG Publishing business, (acquired in April 2003), Clipper Magazine, Inc. (acquired in October 2003), and NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004).
Total newspaper segment operating revenues were $1.66 billion for the quarter, a 9.8 percent increase year-over-year. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of properties in the second quarter of 2004 and 2003, advertising revenues would have increased 9.2 percent. On the same basis, classified advertising rose 12.2 percent, national revenues advanced 10.4 percent and local advertising revenues increased 5.9 percent. Total newspaper segment expenses rose 10.3 percent in the quarter due primarily to acquisitions, higher exchange rates, higher medical and other benefit expenses, and higher newsprint expense. Newsprint expense rose 13.1 percent reflecting higher year-over-year prices, the exchange rate and modestly higher usage. Total newspaper segment operating cash flow, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, rose 8.6 percent to $537.6 million, versus $495.3 million in the same quarter of 2003.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues increased 15.5 percent in the second quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,267 compared with 1,220 in 2003's second quarter, a 3.9 percent increase. For the year-to-date, USA TODAY's advertising revenues increased 12.9 percent and paid pages totaled 2,366 compared to 2,316 for the same period in 2003.
Broadcasting segment results in the quarter include Captivate Network Inc., acquired in April 2004. In the second quarter, broadcasting revenues increased 10.3 percent to $212.5 million from $192.7 million in the same quarter in 2003. Broadcasting operating cash flow increased 11.4 percent to $113.8 million from $102.2 million in the corresponding interval in 2003.
Excluding Captivate, television revenues rose 8.6 percent, operating expenses increased 5.0 percent and operating cash flow was up 11.7 percent for the quarter.
The company's interest expense was $32.0 million in the quarter, down from $36.3 million in the second quarter of 2003, reflecting lower debt levels and lower short term interest rates. Other non-operating expense primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interest and Internet investments.
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 110 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In May, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share totaled 18.2 million unique visitors reaching approximately 11.9 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the United Kingdom where its network Web sites attracted more than 26.6 million monthly page impressions from more than 2.7 million unique users.
All references in this release and attachments to "operating cash flow" are to a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that use of this measure allows investors and management to analyze and compare the company's performance in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's consolidated statements of income is presented on an attachment.

News Release
Tuesday, July 13, 2004
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the sixth period ended June 27, 2004 increased 7.9 percent, as a result of solid advertising demand particularly in classified employment and local advertising. Broadcasting continued to benefit from politically-driven ad spending. For comparison purposes, the continued increase in the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have been up 6.0 percent for the period.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in June rose 9.8 percent compared with 2003's sixth period on a 1.1 percent increase in ROP volume and a 9.4 percent advance in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have increased 7.6 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues increased 11.3 percent in the sixth period on a 1.6 percent increase in ROP ad volume. Employment revenues advanced 21.2 percent, real estate revenues rose 11.6 percent, and automotive fell 3.5 percent compared to last year. On a constant currency basis, employment and real estate revenues advanced 16.0 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively, while automotive would have decreased 5.3 percent. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have risen 7.7 percent for June.
Pro forma local advertising revenues increased 8.6 percent on a 1.0 percent increase in ROP ad volume in June. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., across all products, local ad revenue gains were achieved in the furniture, health, financial, restaurant, office supplies and telecommunications categories while the department store, consumer electronics, grocery and home improvement categories declined compared to the sixth period in 2003. On a constant currency basis, pro forma local advertising would have increased 7.3 percent.
Pro forma national advertising revenues in June advanced 8.9 percent on a 4.9 percent decline in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers fell 4.6 percent in the period. USA WEEKEND, our weekly newspaper magazine and our UK operations experienced higher national ad revenues during the period. While our revenue statistics include their results, USA WEEKEND's and Newsquest's ad volume is not included in the linage numbers. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were up 9.8 percent on a 5.1 percent decrease in paid ad pages to 388 from 408. For the sixth period, at USA TODAY, results for the entertainment, retail and financial categories were particularly strong, while the travel, telecommunications and auto categories decreased.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, increased 8.4 percent in the period. Television revenues were up 8.1 percent with local revenues flat while national revenues advanced 19.4 percent.
For the second quarter of 2004, total pro forma operating revenues were up 7.6 percent and would have increased 5.8 percent on a constant currency basis.
Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the second quarter increased 9.2 percent and 7.0 percent on a constant currency basis.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter increased 12.2 percent and on a constant currency basis would have been up 8.6 percent. Employment revenues rose 23.3 percent, real estate was up 10.5 percent while auto declined 1.4 percent. On a constant currency basis for the quarter, employment and real estate would have advanced 18.1 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, while auto would have declined 3.2 percent.
For the second quarter, pro forma local advertising increased 5.9 percent and would have increased 4.6 percent on a constant currency basis.
Pro forma national advertising increased 10.4 percent for the second quarter. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, national advertising would have increased 9.5 percent.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues increased 8.8 percent and television revenues were up 8.6 percent for the quarter reflecting, in part, higher political advertising. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the third quarter would be ahead of last year's third quarter results in the mid to high teens.
In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share for May from Nielsen//NetRatings. In May, Gannett's domestic Websites had 18.2 million unique visitors reaching 11.9 percent of the Internet audience.
The pro forma advertising and circulation revenue statistics include the results of Captivate (acquired in April 2004), NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004), Clipper Magazine (acquired in October 2003), the SMG (Newsquest's Scottish Media Group) publishing business and the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership as if they had been owned in both years. Ad linage for Newsquest, Clipper and NurseWeek are not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics.
Prior to 2004, the company had included online revenues in the classified advertising revenue total but not in the specific classified categories of help wanted, automotive and real estate. Print and online ad revenues are now reported on a combined basis to calculate the percentage changes in these categories. Results for each period of 2003 have been reclassified to reflect this change.
