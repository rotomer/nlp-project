News Release
Tuesday, October 12, 2004
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2004 third quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were $1.18 versus $1.03 for the third quarter of 2003, a 14.6 percent increase.
Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2004 were $3.47 compared with $3.15 for the same interval in 2003.
Total operating revenues for the company were $1.82 billion for the third quarter compared to $1.63 billion for the same period last year, an 11.3 percent increase. Net income rose 11.2 percent to $310.2 million versus $279.0 million in 2003's third quarter. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) increased to $572.8 million from $523.0 million for the same quarter a year ago.
For the first nine months of 2004, total revenues were $5.42 billion, a 10.8 percent increase over last year. Net income rose 10.1 percent to $939.0 million from $853.2 million and operating cash flow rose 9.1 percent to $1.72 billion.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter totaled 263,804,000 compared with 272,174,000 in 2003's third quarter. Approximately 10.1 million shares were repurchased during the quarter.
Commenting on the company's performance, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO said: "Gannett achieved solid results in the quarter fueled by industry leading revenue growth. Our newspaper operations posted strong year-over-year gains in advertising, most notably in classified employment and real estate. Our results were tempered, however, by the hurricanes in the Southeast that impacted revenue growth and added to expenses at our newspapers and television stations in Florida. In addition, higher newsprint expense and certain employee benefit costs continue to affect results. Overseas, our Newsquest team made another strong contribution to our results which were also helped by a favorable exchange rate. Our broadcasting segment benefited from Summer Olympics-related advertising on our NBC affiliated stations and strong political advertising."
Newspaper segment results in the quarter and year-to-date include the SMG Publishing business, (acquired in April 2003), Clipper Magazine, Inc. (acquired in October 2003), and NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004).
Total newspaper segment operating revenues were $1.61 billion for the quarter, a 10.3 percent increase year-over-year. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of properties in the third quarter of 2004 and 2003, advertising revenues would have increased 9.6 percent. On the same pro forma basis, classified advertising advanced 11.9 percent, national revenues rose 8.7 percent and local advertising revenues were up 7.5 percent. Total newspaper segment expenses rose 12.0 percent in the quarter due primarily to higher exchange rates, medical and other benefit expenses, and newsprint expense. Newsprint expense increased 15.1 percent reflecting higher year-over-year prices, moderately higher usage and the impact of a higher Sterling exchange rate. Also, significant costs associated with the single copy circulation price increase at USA TODAY were included in newspaper segment expenses this quarter. Operating cash flow from our newspaper operations, which include USA TODAY and our UK properties, rose 5.1 percent to $478.7 million, versus $455.4 million in the same quarter of 2003.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues increased 10.2 percent in the third quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,082 compared with 1,023 in 2003's third quarter, a 5.8 percent increase. For the year-to-date, USA TODAY's advertising revenues increased 12.0 percent and paid pages totaled 3,448 compared to 3,338 for the same period in 2003.
Broadcasting segment results in the quarter include Captivate Network Inc., acquired in April 2004. In the third quarter, broadcasting operating cash flow increased 34.4 percent to $106.6 million from $79.3 million in the corresponding interval in 2003. Broadcasting revenues rose 19.7 percent to $206.2 million, reflecting strong Olympic and political advertising in the quarter.
Excluding Captivate, television revenues increased 17.3 percent, operating expenses increased 2.2 percent and operating cash flow was up 35.2 percent for the quarter.
The company's interest expense was $35.8 million in the quarter, up from $33.9 million in the third quarter of 2003, reflecting higher debt levels from share repurchases and higher short term interest rates. Other non-operating expense primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interest and Internet investments.
All references in this release and attachments to "operating cash flow" are to a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that use of this measure allows investors and management to analyze and compare the company's performance in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's consolidated statements of income is presented on an attachment.

The focus on operating cash flow is appropriategiven the consistent and generally predictable strength of cash flowgeneration by newspaper and television operations, and the shortperiod of time it takes to convert new orders to cash.A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's operatingincome, which the company believes is the most directly comparablefinancial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP onthe company's consolidated statements of income, follows:Thirteen weeks ended Sept. 26, 2004                   Newspaper                            Consolidated                  Publishing   Broadcasting Corporate      Total                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating cash flow        $  478,713   $  106,570   $ (12,455)  $    572,828Less:Depreciation         (46,515)      (7,227)     (3,938)       (57,680)Amortization          (2,659)        (313)         -          (2,972)                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating Income  $  429,539   $   99,030   $ (16,393)  $    512,176                  ==========   ==========   =========   ============Thirteen weeks ended Sept. 28, 2003                   Newspaper                            Consolidated                  Publishing   Broadcasting Corporate      Total                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating cash flow        $  455,394   $   79,266   $ (11,612)  $    523,048Less:Depreciation         (47,921)      (6,644)     (3,887)       (58,452)Amortization          (2,134)          -           -          (2,134)                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating Income  $  405,339   $   72,622   $ (15,499)  $    462,462                  ==========   ==========   =========   ============

News Release
Tuesday, October 12, 2004
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the ninth period ended September 26, 2004 increased 7.2 percent, as a result of strength in local and classified advertising. Results for the month were tempered, in part, by the effects of the hurricanes in Florida on our newspaper and television stations there, and the shift of Labor Day into Period 9 this year. For comparison purposes, the continued increase in the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have increased 5.0 percent for the period.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in September grew 9.1 percent compared with 2003's ninth period on a 1.2 percent decrease in ROP volume and a 7.4 percent advance in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have risen 6.5 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues rose 10.4 percent on an almost one percent increase in ROP ad volume in September. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., across all products, local ad revenue gains were achieved in the furniture, consumer electronics, health, telecommunications and home improvement categories while the department store, entertainment, grocery, financial and restaurant categories lagged last year's comparable period. On a constant currency basis, pro forma local advertising would have increased 8.7 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues advanced 9.8 percent in the ninth period on a 2.2 percent decrease in ROP ad volume. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have advanced 5.7 percent for September. Employment revenues increased 15.0 percent, real estate revenues advanced 13.3 percent, and automotive declined 3.4 percent compared to last year. On a constant currency basis, employment and real estate revenues would have increased 9.6 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively, while automotive would have decreased 5.5 percent.
Pro forma national advertising revenues in September increased 3.9 percent on a 2.4 percent decline in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers fell 1.2 percent in the period. USA WEEKEND, our weekly newspaper magazine, and our UK operations experienced significantly higher national ad revenues in the period. While our revenue statistics include their results, USA WEEKEND's and Newsquest's ad volume is not included in the linage numbers. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues decreased 1.9 percent on a 3.6 percent decline in paid ad pages to 372 from 386. For the ninth period, at USA TODAY, strength in the travel, automotive, financial and packaged goods categories was more than offset by weakness in the entertainment, technology, telecommunications, retail and pharmaceutical categories.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, grew 5.8 percent in the period. Television revenues were 5.1 percent higher with national revenues up 11.4 percent and local revenues up 1.4 percent.
For the third quarter of 2004, total pro forma operating revenues were up 9.0 percent and would have increased 6.9 percent on a constant currency basis.
Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the third quarter advanced 9.6 percent and 7.1 percent on a constant currency basis.
For the third quarter, pro forma local advertising rose 7.5 percent and would have increased 6.1 percent on a constant currency basis.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter increased 11.9 percent and on a constant currency basis would have been 7.9 percent higher. Employment revenues increased 20.4 percent, real estate was up 14.1 percent while auto was down 2.1 percent. On a constant currency basis for the quarter, employment and real estate would have advanced 15.0 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively, while auto would have declined 4.2 percent.
Pro forma national advertising was up 8.7 percent for the third quarter. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, national advertising would have advanced 7.7 percent. At USA TODAY advertising revenues increased 10.2 percent in the third quarter reflecting a 5.8 percent increase in paid advertising pages to 1,082 compared to 1,023 in the year-ago period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues increased 18.0 percent and television revenues advanced 17.3 percent for the quarter benefiting, in part, from Olympic and election-related advertising demand. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the fourth quarter would be ahead of last year's fourth quarter results in the low double digits.
In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share for August from Nielsen//NetRatings. In August, Gannett's domestic Websites had over 19 million unique visitors reaching 13.1 percent of the Internet audience.
The pro forma advertising and circulation revenue statistics include the results of Captivate (acquired in April 2004), NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004), Clipper Magazine (acquired in October 2003), the SMG (Newsquest's Scottish Media Group) publishing business and the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership as if they had been owned in both years. Ad linage for Newsquest, Clipper and NurseWeek are not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics.
Prior to 2004, the company had included online revenues in the classified advertising revenue total but not in the specific classified categories of help wanted, automotive and real estate. Print and online ad revenues are now reported on a combined basis to calculate the percentage changes in these categories. Results for each period of 2003 have been reclassified to reflect this change.
