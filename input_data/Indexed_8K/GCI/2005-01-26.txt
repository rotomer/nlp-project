News Release
Wednesday, January 26, 2005
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2004 fourth quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were $1.47 versus $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter of 2003. For the full year 2004, diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, were $4.92, compared with $4.46 for 2003, a new record.
Total operating revenues for the company increased 7.7 percent to $1.96 billion in the quarter from $1.82 billion in the similar interval in 2003. Net income increased 5.6 percent to $378.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 versus $358.0 million in the same quarter of last year. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) rose 5.7 percent to $673.2 million from $637.1 million in the year earlier quarter.
For the full year, operating revenues increased 10.0 percent to $7.4 billion. Net income rose 8.7 percent to a record $1.32 billion from $1.21 billion in 2003 for the year. Operating cash flow advanced 8.1 percent to $2.4 billion from $2.2 billion in 2003.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter totaled 257,673,000 compared with 274,257,000 in 2003's fourth quarter. Average diluted shares outstanding for all of 2004 were 267,590,000 versus 271,872,000 in 2003. Approximately 3.5 million shares were repurchased during the quarter and a total of approximately 20 million for the year.
Commenting on the company's performance, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO said: "Gannett's industry leading revenue performance helped us achieve record operating results for all of 2004, despite an uneven advertising environment. Our results in the fourth quarter reflected strong revenue growth in our broadcasting segment driven by significant levels of politically-related advertising. We also reported solid revenue growth in the newspaper segment due, in part, to higher demand for local and classified advertising. In the UK, Newsquest again posted improved results which also benefited from a favorable exchange rate. However, higher newsprint expense and certain employee benefit costs tempered the company's results. "
Newspaper results in the quarter include Clipper Magazine, Inc. (acquired in October 2003), and NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004). Operating revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter, a 6.4 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2003. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of newspapers in both the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003, advertising revenues would have risen 5.5 percent. On a comparable basis, local advertising revenues were 5.2 percent higher, classified increased 8.7 percent and national ad revenues were unchanged. Newspaper ad volume declined 1.2 percent. Total newspaper segment operating cash flow increased 1.8 percent to $553.8 million in the fourth quarter, versus $544.2 million in the same quarter of 2003. Reported newsprint expense increased 7.5 percent in the quarter, reflecting higher prices but lower usage.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues declined 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,315 compared with 1,580 in the same quarter of 2003. For the full year, USA TODAY's advertising revenues increased 6.6 percent and paid pages totaled 4,763, a 3.2 percent decline.
Broadcasting segment results in the quarter include Captivate Network Inc., acquired in April 2004. Broadcasting revenues totaled $233.4 million for the quarter, an 18.7 percent increase from the fourth quarter in 2003. Broadcasting operating cash flow increased 27.0 percent to $132.6 million from $104.4 million in the year ago quarter.
Excluding Captivate, in the fourth quarter of 2004, television operating cash flow rose 27.3 percent and revenues increased 16.2 percent. The television group's performance reflected strong demand for politically-related advertising in the fall.
Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $41.0 million compared to $33.0 million in the same quarter of 2003, a 24.5 percent increase. The increase is attributable to both higher short-term interest rates, and debt outstanding related to share repurchase activity. Other non-operating expense primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interest and Internet investments in part offset by currency gains and investment income.
At the end of the year, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In December, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was 18.1 million unique visitors reaching about 12 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracts more than 29.7 million monthly page impressions from more than 3.1 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONGannett Co., Inc. and SubsidiariesUnaudited, in thousands of dollars"Operating Cash Flow", a non-GAAP measure, is defined as operatingincome plus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.Management believes that the use of this measure allows investors andmanagement to measure, analyze and compare the cash resourcesgenerated from its business segment operations in a meaningful andconsistent manner. The focus on operating cash flow is appropriategiven the consistent and generally predictable strength of cash flowgeneration by newspaper and television operations, and the shortperiod of time it takes to convert new orders to cash.A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's operatingincome, which the company believes is the most directly comparablefinancial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP onthe company's consolidated statements of income, follows:Thirteen weeks ended Dec. 26, 2004                   Newspaper                            Consolidated                  Publishing   Broadcasting Corporate      Total                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating cash flow        $  553,793   $  132,634   $ (13,226)  $    673,201Less:Depreciation         (45,640)      (7,207)     (3,757)       (56,604)Amortization          (3,161)        (163)         -          (3,324)                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating Income  $  504,992   $  125,264   $ (16,983)  $    613,273                  ==========   ==========   =========   ============Thirteen weeks ended Dec. 28, 2003                   Newspaper                            Consolidated                  Publishing   Broadcasting Corporate      Total                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating cash flow        $  544,249   $  104,427   $ (11,620)  $    637,056Less:Depreciation         (45,253)      (6,537)     (3,712)       (55,502)Amortization          (2,133)          -           -          (2,133)                  ----------   ----------   ---------   ------------Operating Income  $  496,863   $   97,890   $ (15,332)  $    579,421                  ==========   ==========   =========   ============

News Release
Wednesday, January 26, 2005
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the twelfth period ended December 26, 2004 increased 4.7 percent resulting from solid demand for local and classified advertising in the newspaper segment. For comparison purposes, the continued increase in the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have increased 3.2 percent for the period.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in December increased 5.4 percent compared with 2003's twelfth period on a 3.5 percent decline in ROP volume and a 2.9 percent advance in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have increased 3.8 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues rose 5.4 percent on a 3.1 percent decline in ROP ad volume in December. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., across all products, local ad revenue gains were achieved in the department store, grocery, health, financial and telecommunications categories while the furniture, consumer electronics, entertainment, restaurant and home improvement categories lagged last year's comparable period. On a constant currency basis, pro forma local advertising would have been 4.3 percent higher.
Pro forma classified revenues advanced 7.6 percent in the twelfth period on a 3.5 percent decline in ROP ad volume. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have increased 4.7 percent for December. Employment revenues increased 20.9 percent, real estate revenues were up 8.6 percent, and automotive declined 7.8 percent compared to last year's twelfth period. On a constant currency basis, employment and real estate revenues would have increased 16.7 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively, while automotive would have decreased 9.2 percent.
Pro forma national advertising revenues in December rose 1.5 percent on a 7.5 percent decline in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers fell 4.3 percent in the period. USA WEEKEND, our weekly newspaper, experienced higher national ad revenues in the period. While our revenue statistics include USA WEEKEND's results, their ad volume is not included in the linage numbers. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 5.3 percent lower on a 17.5 percent decline in paid ad pages to 434 from 526. For the twelfth period, at USA TODAY, strength in the retail, technology, automotive and entertainment categories was more than offset by weakness in the travel, pharmaceutical and telecommunications categories. On a constant currency basis, national advertising would have increased 0.7 percent for the twelfth period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, rose 1.5 percent in the period. Television revenues were 0.4 percent higher with national revenues up 0.5 percent and local revenues up 0.7 percent.
For the fourth quarter of 2004, total pro forma operating revenues were up 6.2 percent and would have increased 4.9 percent on a constant currency basis.
Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the fourth quarter increased 5.5 percent and would have increased 4.0 percent on a constant currency basis.
For the fourth quarter, pro forma local advertising rose 5.2 percent and would have advanced 4.3 percent on a constant currency basis.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter increased 8.7 percent and on a constant currency basis would have been 6.0 percent higher. Employment revenues were up 18.3 percent, real estate was up 10.4 percent while auto was down 5.2 percent. On a constant currency basis for the quarter, employment and real estate would have increased 14.3 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively, while auto would have declined 6.5 percent.
Pro forma national advertising was flat for the fourth quarter. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, national advertising would have decreased 0.7 percent. At USA TODAY advertising revenues declined 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter reflecting a 16.8 percent decline in paid advertising pages to 1,315 compared to 1,580 in the year-ago period. For the full year, USA TODAY's paid pages numbered 4,763 versus 4,918 last year while ad revenues were 6.6 percent higher than last year.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues rose 17.0 percent and television revenues increased 16.2 percent for the quarter benefiting from strong election-related advertising demand. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the first quarter of 2005 would be below last year's first quarter results in the low to mid single digits. This is due, in part, to the absence of Super Bowl related advertising on our CBS affiliates and political advertising that benefited the first quarter of 2004.
In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share for December from Nielsen//NetRatings. In December, Gannett's domestic Websites had over 18 million unique visitors reaching 12.1 percent of the Internet audience. In the UK, Newsquest's online audience in December totaled 3.1 million unique visitors with 29.7 million page impressions.
The pro forma advertising and circulation revenue statistics include the results of Captivate (acquired in April 2004), NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004), Clipper Magazine (acquired in October 2003), the SMG (Newsquest's Scottish Media Group) publishing business and the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership as if they had been owned in both years. Ad linage for Newsquest, Clipper and NurseWeek are not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics.
Prior to 2004, the company had included online revenues in the classified advertising revenue total but not in the specific classified categories of help wanted, automotive and real estate. Print and online ad revenues are now reported on a combined basis to calculate the percentage changes in these categories. Results for each period of 2003 have been reclassified to reflect this change.
