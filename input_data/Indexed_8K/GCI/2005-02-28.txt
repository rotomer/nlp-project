Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
On February 25, 2005, the Audit Committee of Gannett Co., Inc. (the "Company") dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company. On February 25, 2005, the Company's Audit Committee engaged Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") as its new independent registered public accounting firm.
The reports of PwC on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle.
During the years ended December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, and through February 25, 2005, there were no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused them to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years.
During the years ended December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, and through February 25, 2005, there were no "reportable events" requiring disclosure pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(v) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
The Company has provided PwC with a copy of this Form 8-K prior to its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company requested PwC to furnish it with a letter addressed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of the letter dated February 28, 2005 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
