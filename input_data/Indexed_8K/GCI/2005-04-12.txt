News Release
Tuesday, April 12, 2005
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2005 first quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis increased 5.0 percent to $1.05, a new record. In 2004's first quarter, Gannett earned $1.00 per diluted share on a GAAP basis.
Total operating revenues for the company increased 3.6 percent to $1.79 billion in the quarter from $1.73 billion in the similar interval in 2004. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) rose 2.6 percent to $520.2 million from $507.2 million in the year earlier quarter. Net income was $265.7 million in the first quarter of 2005 versus $274.4 million in the same quarter of last year.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter totaled 254,270,000 compared with 275,507,000 in 2004's first quarter. Approximately 5.3 million shares were repurchased during the quarter.
Commenting on the company's performance, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO said: "We are pleased to announce another quarter of operating revenue, cash flow and earnings per share growth. Our newspaper segment generated solid revenue growth for the full quarter despite much softer advertising demand at the end of March reflecting, in part, the impact of an earlier Easter this year and tougher comparisons as the quarter progressed. USA TODAY posted strong results in both print and online. Our broadcasting segment results were affected by a substantially lower level of political advertising and the absence of the Super Bowl on our six CBS affiliates. Higher newsprint and interest expense and certain employee benefit costs also tempered the company's results."
Newspaper results in the quarter include NurseWeek acquired in February 2004. Total newspaper segment operating cash flow increased 5.4 percent to $466.6 million in the first quarter, versus $442.8 million in the same quarter of 2004. Operating revenues were $1.63 billion for the quarter, a 4.3 percent increase year-over-year. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of newspapers in both the full first quarter of 2005 and 2004, advertising revenues would have increased 4.9 percent. On a comparable basis, local advertising revenues were 6.1 percent higher, and both classified and national ad revenues advanced 4.1 percent. Reported newsprint expense increased 4.3 percent in the quarter reflecting higher prices mitigated by lower usage.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues increased 4.8 percent in the first quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,101 compared with 1,099 in 2004's first quarter.
Broadcasting segment results in the quarter include Captivate Network Inc. acquired in April 2004. Broadcasting revenues totaled $164.6 million for the quarter, a 2.9 percent decline from the first quarter in 2004. Broadcasting operating cash flow declined 13.8 percent to $66.4 million from $77.0 million in the year ago quarter.
Excluding Captivate, in the first quarter of 2005, television operating cash flow declined 12.7 percent and revenues fell 5.1 percent. The television group's performance reflected, in part, the absence of political and Super Bowl advertising.
Interest expense for the first quarter was $44.9 million compared to $31.8 million in the same quarter of 2004. The increase is due to both higher short-term interest rates, and higher debt balances related to share repurchase activity and acquisitions. Other non-operating expense in both 2004 and 2005 primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interest and Internet investments in part offset by investment income. In addition, in the first quarter of 2004, the company recorded a non-monetary gain from a newspaper exchange which was reflected in non-operating income.
During the first quarter, the company announced that it had acquired a 25 percent equity interest in Topix.net, a content aggregation service that continuously monitors breaking news and categorizes daily news content.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company completed the acquisition of the assets of HomeTown Communications Network, Inc., a community publishing company with publications in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky.
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In February, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was 18.7 million unique visitors reaching about 12.7 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracts more than 38.0 million monthly page impressions from more than 3.6 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

News Release
Tuesday, April 12, 2005
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the third period ended March 27, 2005 increased 2.7 percent, benefiting from solid local and classified advertising in its newspaper segment offset by lower revenues from its broadcasting segment. For comparison purposes, the continued increase in the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have increased 1.9 percent for the period.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in March increased 4.2 percent compared with the third period in 2004 on a 2.8 percent decline in ROP volume and a 2.1 percent increase in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have been 3.3 percent higher. Newspaper advertising category results in part reflect the impact of an earlier Easter this year. As in the past, we recommend combining March and April results for comparison purposes.
Pro forma local advertising revenues advanced 6.4 percent on a 1.5 percent decrease in ROP ad volume in March. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., across all products, local ad revenue gains were achieved in the department store, grocery, health and telecommunications categories while the furniture, entertainment and financial categories lagged last year's comparable period. On a constant currency basis, pro forma local advertising would have advanced 5.8 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues rose 2.7 percent in the third period on a 3.3 percent decline in ROP ad volume. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have been up 1.2 percent for March. Employment revenues increased 4.9 percent, real estate revenues were up less than 1.0 percent and automotive revenues declined 4.2 percent compared to last year's third period. Classified results in our domestic newspapers were stronger than in the UK. On a constant currency basis, employment would have increased 3.1 percent, while real estate and automotive revenues would have declined 1.1 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively.
Pro forma national advertising revenues in March were 2.9 percent higher on a 5.9 percent decline in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers was 6.2 percent lower in the period. Newsquest experienced higher national ad revenues in the period. While our revenue statistics include Newsquest's results, their ad volume is not included in the linage numbers.  
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 6.9 percent higher on a 2.1 percent decline in paid ad pages to 373 from 381. For comparison purposes, USA TODAY's ad revenues and paid pages were up 24.9 percent and 15.8 percent, respectively, in March of 2004. For the third period, at USA TODAY, strength in the travel, technology, entertainment, telecommunications and pharmaceutical categories was offset by weakness in the automotive, financial and retail categories. On a constant currency basis, national advertising would have been up 2.5 percent for the third period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, fell 5.7 percent in the period. Television revenues were 6.4 percent lower reflecting significantly lower political advertising. National revenues were down 17.3 percent while local revenues were flat.
For the first quarter of 2005, total pro forma operating revenues were up 3.2 percent and would have increased 2.6 percent on a constant currency basis.
Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the first quarter increased 4.9 percent and would have advanced 4.2 percent on a constant currency basis.
For the first quarter, pro forma local advertising was 6.1 percent higher and would have increased 5.7 percent on a constant currency basis.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter were up 4.1 percent and on a constant currency basis would have been 3.0 percent higher. Employment revenues were 8.8 percent higher; real estate revenues increased 1.3 percent while auto revenues declined 3.7 percent. On a constant currency basis for the quarter, employment and real estate revenues would have been up 7.3 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, while auto revenues would have been down 4.3 percent.
Pro forma national advertising was up 4.1 percent for the first quarter. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, national advertising would have been up 3.8 percent. At USA TODAY advertising revenues increased 4.8 percent in the quarter on a slight increase in paid advertising pages to 1,101 compared to 1,099 in the year-ago period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues for the quarter decreased 4.4 percent and television revenues were 5.1 percent lower reflecting the lack of both political and Super Bowl advertising. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the second quarter of 2005 would be below last year's second quarter in the mid to high single digits. This is due, in part, to the absence of significant political advertising that benefited the second quarter of 2004.
The pro forma revenue statistics include the results of Captivate (acquired in April 2004). Ad linage for Newsquest, Clipper and NurseWeek are not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics.
Gannett Co., Inc. is a leading international news and information company that publishes 102 daily newspapers in the USA, including USA TODAY, the nation's largest-selling daily newspaper. The company also owns more than 800 non-daily publications in the USA and USA WEEKEND, a weekly newspaper magazine.
