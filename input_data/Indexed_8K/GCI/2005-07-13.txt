News Release
Wednesday, July 13, 2005
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2005 second quarter earnings per diluted share, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were $1.37 versus $1.30 for the second quarter of 2004, a 5.4 percent increase.
Diluted earnings per share for the first six months of 2005 were $2.41 compared with $2.29 for the same interval in 2004.
Total operating revenues for the company were $1.94 billion for the second quarter compared to $1.87 billion for the same period last year, a 3.4 percent increase. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was $634.3 million compared with $638.5 million for the same quarter a year ago. Net income was $338.6 million versus $354.4 million in 2004's second quarter.
For the first six months of 2005, total revenues were $3.73 billion, a 3.5 percent increase. Operating cash flow totaled $1.15 billion and net income was $604.4 million for the six months.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter totaled 248,009,000 compared with 273,541,000 in 2004's second quarter. Approximately 5.3 million shares were repurchased during the quarter.
Commenting on the company's results, Douglas H. McCorkindale, Chairman, President and CEO, said: "We are pleased to announce another quarter of operating revenue and earnings per share growth despite the challenges faced by our UK and broadcasting operations. Our U.S. newspapers produced industry leading ad revenue growth, benefiting from growth in local and employment classified advertising. Our operations in the United Kingdom lagged last year's results as advertising demand was impacted by the slowdown in the UK economy. Broadcasting's results were affected by a much lower level of political advertising and softer ad demand, particularly in automotive. Our results also were tempered by higher interest expense and the effect of expenses associated with a major press project at our Detroit newspaper. "
The company announced during the second quarter that Craig Dubow, President and CEO of the Gannett Broadcasting Division will become President and CEO of Gannett Co., Inc. effective July 15th.
Newspaper segment results in the quarter include PointRoll, Inc. acquired in June 2005 and HomeTown Communications acquired in late March 2005.
Total newspaper segment operating revenues were $1.74 billion for the quarter, a 4.7 percent increase year-over-year. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of properties in both the full second quarter of 2005 and 2004, advertising revenues would have increased 3.1 percent. On the same basis, classified advertising rose 4.9 percent; local advertising revenues increased 2.6 percent while national revenues fell slightly. Total newspaper segment operating cash flow, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, rose 2.1 percent to $549.0 million, versus $537.6 million in the same quarter of 2004.
Total newspaper segment expenses rose 6.7 percent in the quarter due to acquisitions and higher newsprint and depreciation and amortization expense. Newsprint expense rose 7.2 percent reflecting higher year-over-year prices mitigated by lower usage. In addition, during the quarter, the company recorded costs associated with a new press project in Detroit.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues declined 1.4 percent in the second quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,191 compared with 1,267 in 2004's second quarter, a 6.0 percent decline. For the year-to-date, USA TODAY's advertising revenues rose 1.5 percent and paid pages totaled 2,292 compared with 2,366 for the same period in 2004.
Broadcasting segment results in the quarter include Captivate Network Inc., acquired in April 2004. In the second quarter, broadcasting revenues declined 6.9 percent to $197.9 million from $212.5 million in the same quarter in 2004. Broadcasting operating cash flow fell 13.3 percent to $98.7 million from $113.8 million in the corresponding interval in 2004.
Excluding Captivate, television revenues declined 7.9 percent, operating expenses were 1.1 percent lower and operating cash flow was down 13.4 percent for the quarter.
Interest expense was $48.4 million in the quarter versus $32.0 million in the second quarter of 2004, reflecting both higher short term rates and higher debt balances related to share repurchase activity and acquisitions. During the quarter, the company issued $500 million of 3-year debt with a coupon of 4.125 percent. Other non-operating expense primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interest and Internet investments, in part offset by investment income.
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 110 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In June, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share totaled 20 million unique visitors reaching approximately 13 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the United Kingdom where its network Web sites attracted more than 40 million monthly page impressions from approximately 2.9 million unique users in June.
All references in this release and attachments to "operating cash flow" are to a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that use of this measure allows investors and management to analyze and compare the company's performance in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's consolidated statements of income is presented on an attachment.

News Release
Wednesday, July 13, 2005
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the sixth period ended June 26, 2005 increased slightly, resulting primarily from higher demand for advertising at the company's local, domestic newspapers offset by declines in its Broadcasting and UK operations' results. Broadcasting revenues decreased 7.7 percent reflecting, in part, significantly lower political ad spending. The exchange rate of Sterling had almost no impact on results this period as the exchange rate was virtually flat year-over-year.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in June advanced 0.8 percent compared with the sixth period in 2004 on a 3.6 percent decline in ROP volume and a 0.2 percent decline in preprint distribution.
Pro forma local advertising revenues were up 0.9 percent on a 5.8 percent decline in ROP ad volume in June. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., across all products, local ad revenue gains were achieved in the consumer electronics, health and telecommunications categories while the furniture, entertainment, financial, restaurants, and home improvement categories lagged last year's comparable period.
Pro forma classified revenues rose 2.6 percent in the sixth period on a 1.9 percent decline in ROP ad volume. Employment revenues rose 3.7 percent, real estate revenues were up 3.3 percent and automotive revenues were 4.7 percent lower compared to last year's sixth period. Classified results in our domestic newspapers were stronger than in the UK. Employment revenues were up 17.3 percent in the U.S.
Pro forma national advertising revenues in June were 4.7 percent lower on a 10.1 percent decline in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers was down 9.8 percent in the period. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 7.6 percent lower on a 6.4 percent decline in paid ad pages to 363 from 388. For the sixth period, at USA TODAY, strength in the automotive, financial and packaged goods categories were more than offset by weakness in the entertainment, travel, retail and telecommunications categories.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, declined 7.7 percent in the period. Television revenues were 8.1 percent lower reflecting significantly lower political advertising. Local revenues increased slightly while national revenues declined 19.5 percent.
For the second quarter of 2005, total pro forma operating revenues increased 2.1 percent and would have increased 1.6 percent on a constant currency basis.
Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the second quarter advanced 3.1 percent and would have been 2.6 percent higher on a constant currency basis.
For the second quarter, pro forma local advertising was up 2.6 percent and would have increased 2.3 percent on a constant currency basis.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter were up 4.9 percent and on a constant currency basis would have been 4.0 percent higher. Employment revenues advanced 7.8 percent; real estate revenues increased 6.5 percent while auto revenues were 5.0 percent lower. On a constant currency basis for the quarter, employment and real estate revenues would have been up 6.8 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively, while auto revenues would have been down 5.5 percent.
Pro forma national advertising was down slightly for the second quarter. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues fell 1.4 percent in the second quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,191 compared with 1,267 in the second quarter of 2004, a 6.0 percent decline.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues for the quarter declined 6.9 percent and television revenues were 7.9 percent lower reflecting lower political advertising. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the third quarter of 2005 would be below last year's third quarter in the high teens. This is due, in part, to the absence of very significant political and Olympic advertising that benefited the third quarter of 2004.
In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share from Nielsen//Net Ratings. In June, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share totaled 20 million unique visitors reaching approximately 13 percent of the Internet audience. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the United Kingdom where its network Web sites attracted more than 40 million monthly page impressions from approximately 2.9 million unique users in June.
The pro forma advertising and circulation revenue statistics include the results for HomeTown Communications (acquired in late March 2005), Captivate (acquired in April 2004) and NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004). The pro forma other revenue statistics include the results for PointRoll, Inc. (acquired in June 2005). Ad linage for Newsquest, Clipper and NurseWeek are not included in the ad volume statistics.
