News Release
Tuesday, October 11, 2005
    McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2005 third quarter earnings from operations per diluted share were $1.14 including income from discontinued operations of 1 cent per diluted share. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis were $1.13 for the third quarter compared to $1.16 in the third quarter of 2004.
    During the quarter, the company completed an exchange of assets with Knight Ridder, Inc. in which Knight Ridder received from Gannett The (Boise) Idaho Statesman, and two newspapers in the state of Washington: The (Olympia) Olympian, and The Bellingham Herald. In return, Gannett received the Tallahassee (FL) Democrat and cash consideration. This exchange was accounted for as a sale of discontinued operations and a purchase of the Tallahassee newspaper. Operating results for the third quarter and year-to-date exclude contributions from the former Gannett properties which have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations totaled $3.6 million in the quarter or 1 cent per diluted share and $14.6 million or 6 cents per diluted share year-to-date. The exchange also resulted in a third quarter after-tax gain of $18.8 million or 8 cents per diluted share which is also included in discontinued operations. Therefore, diluted earnings per share, including both the income and the gain from discontinued operations, were $1.22 for the quarter.
    In addition, the company and MediaNews Group announced the reorganization of the Detroit Newspaper Agency during the quarter. As part of the transaction, Knight Ridder sold its newspaper interests in Detroit to Gannett and MediaNews Group and the two newspaper publishers formed the Detroit Newspaper Partnership, L.P. MediaNews Group acquired The Detroit News from Gannett and Gannett acquired the Detroit Free Press. Beginning August 1, 2005, Detroit's results have been fully consolidated in the financial statements of Gannett along with a minority interest charge for MediaNews Group's interest. Prior to that date, the results from the company's 50 percent interest in Detroit had been reported in other operating revenue.
    Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2005, including the income and the gain from discontinued operations were $3.62 per diluted share. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled $3.49 versus $3.41 for the same interval in 2004.
    Operating revenues rose 4.1 percent to $1.86 billion in the third quarter reflecting the full consolidation of Detroit newspaper operations beginning on August 1, 2005. If Gannett had owned the same complement of properties for the full quarters in 2005 and 2004, revenues from continuing operations would have declined almost 1 percent. Operating expenses for the quarter rose 8.0 percent. This increase was principally the result of the full consolidation of the Detroit newspaper operations. On a pro forma basis, operating expenses rose approximately 1.4 percent. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was $540.9 million in the quarter versus $563.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income was $274.6 million in the quarter compared with $304.8 million in the third quarter of 2004.
    For the first nine months of 2005, operating revenues increased 3.7 percent to $5.54 billion. If Gannett had owned the same complement of properties for the full nine month period in 2005 and 2004, revenues from continuing operations would have increased 1.3 percent. Net income was $868.0 million compared with $923.4 million for the nine month interval in 2004.
    Average diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter totaled 244,013,000 compared with 263,804,000 in 2004's third quarter. Approximately 3.6 million shares were repurchased during the quarter.
    Commenting on the company's results, Craig A. Dubow, President and CEO, said: "In the third quarter of last year, the company benefited from over $50 million of Summer Olympics and politically-related advertising. The absence of these events combined with softer ad demand in the auto category unfavorably impacted our broadcasting segment results. Our domestic newspapers posted solid revenue gains driven by classified advertising demand, particularly employment and real estate. However, our UK operations continue to be challenged by the slowing UK economy resulting in lower ad demand. Higher newsprint expense and higher interest costs also tempered our results in the quarter. Looking ahead, the fourth quarter will also be affected by comparisons to the almost $50 million of politically-related ad demand from last year's fall elections and a continuing soft advertising outlook in the UK."
    Newspaper results in the quarter and year-to-date include Tallahassee (acquired August 29, 2005), 100 percent of the Detroit Newspaper Partnership (established August 2005), PointRoll, Inc. (acquired in June 2005), Hometown Communications (acquired in March 2005) and NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004).
    Total newspaper segment operating revenues were $1.70 billion for the quarter, a 7.1 percent increase year-over-year. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of properties in both the third quarter of 2005 and 2004, advertising revenues would have risen 1.1 percent. On the same basis, classified advertising advanced 1.4 percent; local advertising revenues rose 1.3 percent while national revenues were flat. Total newspaper segment operating cash flow, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, was up 3.2 percent to $484.3 million, versus $469.3 million in the same quarter of 2004.
    Total newspaper segment operating expenses increased 9.0 percent in the quarter due principally to the full consolidation of Detroit operations. Newsprint costs rose 7.7 percent substantially due to the inclusion of 100 percent of the Detroit operations. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of newspaper properties for all of the third quarter of 2005 and 2004, newspaper operating expenses would have risen 1.7 percent.
    At USA TODAY, advertising revenues declined 2.7 percent in the third quarter reflecting the absence of Summer Olympics-related ad demand. Paid advertising pages totaled 981 compared with 1,082 in 2004's third quarter, a 9.3 percent decline. For the year-to-date, USA TODAY's advertising revenues were slightly ahead of last year and paid pages totaled 3,273 compared with 3,448 for the same period in 2004.
    Broadcasting segment results in the quarter and year-to-date include Captivate Network, Inc., (acquired in April 2004). In the third quarter, broadcasting revenues declined 19.3 percent to $166.4 million from $206.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline reflects the absence of over $50 million of Summer Olympics and politically-related advertising demand that benefited results for the third quarter of 2004. Broadcasting operating cash flow was $69.0 million compared to $106.6 million in the corresponding interval in 2004. Broadcasting segment operating expenses fell 1.9 percent for the quarter.
    Excluding Captivate, television revenues declined 20.1 percent and operating expenses were 2.6 percent lower.
    Interest expense was $55.0 million in the quarter versus $35.8 million in the third quarter of 2004, reflecting both higher short term interest rates and higher debt balances related to share repurchase activity and acquisitions. Other non-operating expense primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interest and Internet investments, in part offset by investment income.
    At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In September, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share totaled 21.4 million unique visitors reaching approximately 14 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the United Kingdom where its network Web sites attracted 120 million monthly page impressions from approximately 11 million unique users in the third quarter.

News Release 
Tuesday, October 11, 2005
    McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the ninth period ended September 25, 2005 increased 1.1 percent, resulting from solid advertising demand at its domestic community newspapers and USA TODAY offset by significantly lower political ad spending in its broadcasting segment, and lower ad demand at its UK properties. For comparison purposes, there was a very slight change in the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year in the period.
    Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in September increased 1.9 percent compared with the ninth period in 2004 on declines in ROP volume and preprint distribution of 1.3 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.
    Pro forma local advertising revenues were 1.6 percent higher on a 1.0 percent decline in ROP ad volume in September. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., across all products, local ad revenue gains were achieved in the consumer electronics, health and financial categories while the department stores, furniture, telecommunications and home improvement categories lagged last year's comparable period results.
    Pro forma classified revenues increased slightly in the ninth period on a 2.2 percent decline in ROP ad volume. Employment revenues were up less than 1 percent, real estate revenues rose 3.5 percent while automotive revenues were 9.8 percent lower compared to last year's ninth period. Overall, the company's domestic classified results were stronger than its UK results. In the U.S., employment revenues advanced 13.6 percent and real estate revenues were up 6.9 percent in the ninth period while automotive fell almost 9 percent.
    Pro forma national advertising revenues in September increased 6.9 percent on an 8.4 percent increase in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers was up 9.5 percent in the period. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 8.3 percent higher on a slight increase in paid ad pages to 375 from 372. For the ninth period, at USA TODAY, the entertainment, automotive, technology, financial, advocacy and home and building categories were positive while the travel and telecommunications categories lagged Period 9's results in 2004. For the year-to-date, USA TODAY's advertising revenues were slightly ahead of last year while paid advertising pages totaled 3,273 versus 3,448 last year.
    Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, declined 8.8 percent in the period. Television revenues were 9.8 percent lower reflecting significantly lower political advertising. Local revenues declined slightly while national revenues were 23.6 percent lower.
    For the third quarter of 2005, total pro forma operating revenues declined almost 1 percent. The exchange rate of Sterling decreased slightly for the quarter compared to the year ago quarter. Total pro forma operating revenues would have been 0.7 percent lower on a constant currency basis.
    Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the third quarter rose 1.1 percent and would have been 1.4 percent higher on a constant currency basis.
    For the third quarter, pro forma local advertising increased 1.3 percent.
    Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter were up 1.4 percent and on a constant currency basis would have been 1.8 percent higher. Employment revenues increased 2.0 percent; real estate revenues rose 3.0 percent while auto revenues were 9.2 percent lower. On a constant currency basis for the quarter, employment and real estate revenues would have been up 2.5 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively, while auto revenues would have been down 8.9 percent.
    Pro forma national advertising was up slightly for the third quarter. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 2.7 percent lower in the third quarter compared to the year-ago quarter reflecting the absence of Olympics-related revenues. Paid advertising pages totaled 981 compared with 1,082 in the third quarter of 2004.
    Pro forma broadcasting revenues for the quarter were down 19.3 percent and television revenues were 20.1 percent lower reflecting the absence of Summer Olympics-related ad demand and significantly lower political advertising. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 would be below last year's fourth quarter in the low to mid teens. This is due, in part, to the absence of almost $50 million of political advertising that benefited the fourth quarter of 2004.
    In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share from Nielsen//Net Ratings. In September, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share totaled 21.4 million unique visitors reaching approximately 14 percent of the Internet audience.
    On August 3, 2005, the company and MediaNews Group announced the reorganization of the Detroit Newspaper Agency. As part of the transaction, Knight Ridder sold its newspaper interests in Detroit to Gannett and MediaNews Group and the two newspaper publishers formed the Detroit Newspaper Partnership, L.P. MediaNews Group acquired The Detroit News from Gannett and Gannett acquired the Detroit Free Press. Detroit's results have been fully consolidated in the financial statements of Gannett along with a minority interest charge for MediaNews Group's interest.
    In a separate transaction on August 29th, the company completed an exchange of assets with Knight Ridder, Inc. in which Knight Ridder received from Gannett The (Boise) Idaho Statesman, and two newspapers in the state of Washington: The (Olympia) Olympian, and The Bellingham Herald. In return, Gannett received the Tallahassee (FL) Democrat and cash consideration. Therefore, all previously reported results for the former Gannett properties have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations. In addition, a gain resulting from the exchange has been included in discontinued operations.
    The pro forma advertising and circulation revenue statistics include the results for Tallahassee (acquired August 29, 2005), 100 percent of the Detroit Newspaper Partnership (established August 2005), Mint Magazine (acquired in July 2005), HomeTown Communications (acquired in late March 2005), Captivate (acquired in April 2004) and NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004). The pro forma other revenue statistics include the results for PointRoll, Inc. (acquired in June 2005). Ad linage for Newsquest, Clipper and NurseWeek are not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics. The revenue and statistical data related to the former Gannett owned newspapers in Bellingham (WA), Olympia (WA) and Boise (ID) has been excluded from all periods presented.
    Gannett Co., Inc. is a leading international news and information company that publishes 99 daily newspapers in the USA, including USA TODAY, the nation's largest-selling daily newspaper. The company also owns more than 900 non-daily publications in the USA and USA WEEKEND, a weekly newspaper magazine. Gannett subsidiary Newsquest is the United Kingdom's second largest regional newspaper company. Newsquest publishes more than 300 titles, including 17 daily newspapers, and a network of prize-winning Web sites. Gannett also operates 21 television stations in the United States and is an Internet leader with sites sponsored by its TV stations and newspapers including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular news sites on the Web.
