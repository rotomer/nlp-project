Gannett Co., Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter Results and 2005 Full-Year Results
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2005 fourth quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, were $1.44, compared with $1.44 per share for the fourth quarter of 2004. For the full year 2005, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, on a GAAP basis, were $4.92 compared with $4.84 for 2004.
As previously reported, the company completed an exchange of properties withKnight Ridder, Inc. in August 2005. This exchange of three Gannett newspapers and Knight Ridder's Tallahassee, FL, newspaper, was accounted for as a sale of discontinued operations and a purchase of the Tallahassee newspaper. Operating results for all periods presented exclude contributions from the former Gannett properties which have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations. The exchange also resulted in an after-tax gain which was included in discontinued operations for the year.
Results for the quarter also include the Detroit Newspaper Partnership, L.P. Beginning August 1, 2005, Detroit's results have been fully consolidated in the financial statements of Gannett along with a minority interest charge for MediaNews Group's interest.
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Total operating revenues for the company increased 6.1 percent to $2.05 billion in the fourth quarter from $1.94 billion in the similar interval in 2004. This increase is due to the full consolidation of Detroit newspaper operations. On a pro forma basis, assuming Gannett owned the same complement of properties in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, total operating revenues would have been 1.9 percent lower. Reported operating expenses increased 10.8 percent in the quarter reflecting principally the full consolidation of Detroit newspaper operations. On a pro forma basis, operating expenses were up less than 1 percent. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was $646.2 million compared with $662.6 million in the year earlier quarter. Net income was $343.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 versus $371.9 million in the same quarter of last year.
For the year, total operating revenues rose 4.3 percent to $7.6 billion, a new record. On a pro forma basis, assuming Gannett owned the same complement of properties for all of 2005 and 2004, total operating revenues would have increased 0.4 percent. Operating cash flow declined 1.3 percent to $2.32 billion from $2.35 billion in 2004. Net income totaled $1.21 billion versus $1.30 billion in 2004.
(more)
Average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter totaled 239,128,000 compared with 257,673,000 in 2004's fourth quarter. Average diluted shares outstanding for all of 2005 were 246,256,000 versus 267,590,000 in 2004. Approximately 3.2 million shares were repurchased during the quarter and a total of approximately 17.5 million shares for the year.
Commenting on the company's performance, Craig A. Dubow, President and CEO said: "We are pleased to report record revenues for the year. We achieved these results in a subdued advertising environment and despite comparisons with more than $120 million of election and Olympic-related ad demand that benefited our results in 2004. For the quarter, our results reflect strong finishes in December at USA TODAY and our broadcasting segment. Also in the quarter, broadcasting had to overcome the $48 million in politically related advertising that bolstered results in the fourth quarter of 2004. Our domestic community newspapers experienced higher ad demand in classified employment and real estate during the quarter although auto advertising remained soft. Our operations in the United Kingdom lagged last year's results as advertising demand was impacted by the slowdown in the UK economy. Higher interest costs and newsprint expense and an unfavorable exchange rate also tempered our results for the quarter."
NEWSPAPERS
Newspaper results in the quarter and year-to-date include Exchange & Mart and Auto Exchange (acquired in September 2005), Tallahassee (acquired in August 2005), 100 percent of the Detroit Newspaper Partnership (established August 2005), PointRoll, Inc. (acquired in June 2005) and Hometown Communications (acquired in March 2005).
Operating revenues were $1.85 billion for the quarter, an 8.5 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2004. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of newspapers in both the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, advertising revenues would have declined 1.0 percent. On a comparable basis, local advertising revenues were 1.1 percent lower, classified was down 1.2 percent and national ad revenues were 0.4 percent lower. Newspaper ad volume was down 3.8 percent for the quarter. Total newspaper segment operating cash flow which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties rose 1.6 percent to $551.6 million in the fourth quarter versus $543.2 million in the same quarter of 2004.
For the quarter, total newspaper operating expenses increased 12.0 percent reflecting the full consolidation of the Detroit newspaper operations. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of properties for the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, pro forma expense would have increased less than 1 percent. The consolidation of Detroit also had an impact on reported newsprint expense, which increased 14.9 percent in the quarter, reflecting higher newsprint prices.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues rose 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,226 compared with 1,315 in the same quarter of 2004. For the full year, USA TODAY's advertising revenues increased almost 1.0 percent and paid pages totaled 4,499.
(more) BROADCASTING
Broadcasting revenues totaled $207.6 million for the quarter, an 11 percent decrease from the fourth quarter of 2004. The decline reflects the lack of over $48 million of politically related ad demand that positively impacted results for the fourth quarter of 2004. Broadcasting operating cash flow was $107.9 million compared with $132.6 million in the year ago quarter. Broadcasting expenses were 0.7 percent lower in the quarter.
Excluding Captivate, in the fourth quarter of 2005, television revenues were $201.8 million compared to $228.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
NON-OPERATING ITEMS
Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $62.3 million compared to $41.0 million in the same quarter of 2004. The increase is attributable to both higher short-term interest rates and debt outstanding related to share repurchase activity and acquisitions. Other non-operating income primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interests and Internet investment costs offset by currency gains, investment income and a minor, non-monetary gain recorded in connection with the reorganization of the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership.
During the quarter, the company together with MediaNews Group agreed to expand and reorganize the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership to include four Pennsylvania newspapers. Gannett contributed the Public Opinion of Chambersburg, PA, to the partnership and recognized a non-monetary gain. MediaNews contributed three newspapers. When the transaction closed on December 25, 2005, the company's ownership interest in the partnership was reduced and MediaNews Group became the managing partner. Beginning in the first period of 2006, the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership will no longer be consolidated in the company's financial statements and the company's interest in the partnership results will be included in other operating revenues.
At the end of the year, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In December, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was approximately 21 million unique visitors reaching about 13.5 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracted more than 31 million monthly page impressions from more than 2.7 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONGannett Co., Inc. and SubsidiariesUnaudited, in thousands of dollars
"Operating Cash Flow", a non-GAAP measure, is defined as operatingincome plus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.Management believes that the use of this measure allows investors andmanagement to measure, analyze and compare the cash resourcesgenerated from its business segment operations in a meaningful andconsistent manner. The focus on operating cash flow is appropriategiven the consistent and generally predictable strength of cash flowgeneration by newspaper and television operations, and the shortperiod of time it takes to convert new orders to cash.
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's operatingincome, which the company believes is the most directly comparablefinancial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP onthe company's consolidated statements of income, follows:

Friday, January 27, 2006
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the twelfth period ended December 25, 2005 were flat resulting from year-over-gains in national advertising and higher advertising demand at its broadcasting segment offset, in part, by lower ad demand at its UK properties. For comparison purposes, the decline in the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have increased 1.4 percent for the period.
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in December declined slightly compared with 2004's twelfth period on a 3.4 percent decline in ROP volume and a 1.3 percent increase in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have increased 1.1 percent. Domestic newspaper advertising revenue increased 2.1 percent in December.
Pro forma local advertising revenues were 0.7 percent lower on a 3.3 percent decline in ROP ad volume in December. In the U.S., local advertising was up almost 1 percent with the performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers outpacing the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. Across all products in the U.S., local ad revenue gains were achieved in the health, financial and home improvement categories while the department store, furniture, entertainment, grocery and telecommunications categories lagged last year's comparable period. On a constant currency basis, pro forma local advertising would have been up slightly.
Pro forma classified revenues declined 2.1 percent in the twelfth period on a 3.8 percent decline in ROP ad volume. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have been up almost 1 percent for December. Real estate revenues were up 13.2 percent, employment revenues rose 1.2 percent, while automotive declined 19.9 percent compared to last year's twelfth period. On a constant currency basis, real estate and employment revenues would have increased 16.5 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, while automotive would have been 17.7 percent lower. Overall, the company's domestic classified results were better than its UK results. In the U.S., pro forma classified revenues increased 3.2 percent comprised of a 17.5 percent increase in real estate revenues and a 15.3 percent increase in employment revenues in the twelfth period while automotive declined 17.0 percent.
Pro forma national advertising revenues in December were 3.1 percent higher on a slight decrease in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers declined1.2 percent in the period. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 13.0 percent higher on a
1.2 percent decline in paid ad pages to 429 from 434. For the twelfth period, at USA TODAY, the technology, automotive, telecommunications, advocacy and financial categories were very positive while the retail, entertainment and travel categories lagged results for the same period in 2004. On a constant currency basis, national advertising would have been up 3.8 percent for the twelfth period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, rose 5.1 percent in the period. Television revenues were 5.5 percent higher with national revenues and local revenues up 6.0 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.
For the fourth quarter of 2005, total pro forma operating revenues were 1.9 percent lower and would have been down 1.1 percent on a constant currency basis.
Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the fourth quarter declined 1.0 percent and would have been down slightly on a constant currency basis. The company's U.S. results were stronger than its UK results as domestic newspaper advertising revenues were up 1.2 percent in the quarter.
For the fourth quarter, pro forma local advertising was down 1.1 percent and would have been 0.6 percent lower on a constant currency basis. Local advertising in the U.S. for the quarter was down slightly.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter declined 1.2 percent and on a constant currency basis would have been up 0.4 percent. Real estate revenues were 8.4 percent higher, employment was up 0.4 percent, while auto was down 16.3 percent. On a constant currency basis for the quarter, real estate and employment would have been up 10.2 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, while auto would have been 15.1 percent lower. For the quarter, classified revenues were up 3.9 percent in the U.S. with both employment and real estate revenues up 13.8 percent while automotive was down 15.3 percent.
Pro forma national advertising was down slightly for the fourth quarter. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, national advertising would have been unchanged. At USA TODAY advertising revenues rose 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter on a 6.8 percent decline in paid advertising pages to 1,226 compared to 1,315 in the year-ago period. For the full year, USA TODAY's ad revenues were almost 1 percent higher than last year while paid pages numbered 4,499 versus 4,763 last year.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues declined 11.0 percent and television revenues were 11.7 percent lower for the quarter. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the first quarter of 2006 would be ahead of last year's first quarter results in the high single digits, reflecting primarily the impact of ad demand related to the Winter Olympic Games on our NBC affiliates in February of 2006.
In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share for December from Nielsen//NetRatings. In
December, Gannett's domestic Websites had approximately 21 million unique visitors reaching 13.5 percent of the Internet audience. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracted more than 31 million monthly page impressions from more than 2.7 million unique users.
On December 1, 2005, Gannett Co., Inc., and MediaNews Group, Inc. announced an agreement to expand their Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership to include four newspapers in Pennsylvania. The transaction closed on December 25, 2005. Gannett contributed the Public Opinion of Chambersburg, PA to the partnership. MediaNews Group contributed the York Daily Record and York Sunday News, the Lebanon Daily News of Lebanon and the Evening Sun of Hanover. The York Daily Record and York Sunday News continue to operate under the terms of a JOA which includes the York Dispatch. As a result of this transaction, the company's ownership interest was reduced and Media News became the managing partner. Beginning in the first period of 2006, the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership will no longer be consolidated on the company's financial statements and the company's interest in the partnership will be included in other revenues.
On August 3, 2005, the company and MediaNews Group announced the reorganization of the Detroit Newspaper Agency. As part of the transaction, Knight Ridder sold its newspaper interests in Detroit to Gannett and MediaNews Group and the two newspaper publishers formed the Detroit Newspaper Partnership, L.P. MediaNews Group acquired The Detroit News from Gannett and Gannett acquired the Detroit Free Press. Detroit's results have been fully consolidated in the financial statements of Gannett along with a minority interest charge for MediaNews Group's interest.
In a separate transaction on August 29, 2005, the company completed an exchange of assets with Knight Ridder, Inc. in which Knight Ridder received from Gannett The (Boise) Idaho Statesman, and two newspapers in the state of Washington: The (Olympia) Olympian, and The Bellingham Herald. In return, Gannett received the Tallahassee (FL) Democrat and cash consideration. Therefore, all previously reported results for the former Gannett properties have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations. In addition, a gain resulting from the exchange has been included in discontinued operations.
The pro forma advertising and circulation revenue statistics include the results for Exchange & Mart and Auto Exchange (acquired in September 2005), Tallahassee (acquired August 29, 2005), 100 percent of the Detroit Newspaper Partnership (established August 2005), Mint Magazine (acquired in July 2005), HomeTown Communications (acquired in late March 2005), Captivate (acquired in April 2004) and NurseWeek (acquired in February 2004). The pro forma other revenue statistics include the results for PointRoll, Inc. (acquired in June 2005). Ad linage for Newsquest, Clipper and NurseWeek are not included in the ad volume statistics. Circulation volume numbers for Newsquest's paid daily newspapers are included in the enclosed statistics, but volume from unpaid daily and non-daily publications is not included in the circulation volume statistics. The revenue and statistical data related to the former Gannett owned newspapers in Bellingham (WA), Olympia (WA) and Boise (ID) has been excluded from all periods presented.
Gannett Co., Inc. is a leading international news and information company that publishes 91 daily newspapers in the USA, including USA TODAY, the nation's largest-selling daily
newspaper. The company also owns more than 1,000 non-daily publications in the USA and USA WEEKEND, a weekly newspaper magazine. Gannett subsidiary Newsquest is the United Kingdom's second largest regional newspaper company. Newsquest publishes more than 300 titles, including 17 daily newspapers, and a network of prize-winning Web sites. Gannett also operates 21 television stations in the United States and is an Internet leader with sites sponsored by its TV stations and newspapers including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular news sites on the Web.
