News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Wednesday, April 12, 2006
Gannett Co., Inc. Reports First Quarter Results
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2006 first quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.99 compared to $1.03 per share in the first quarter of 2005. The company began reporting stock compensation expense in the first quarter of 2006 as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123-R. This non-cash expense totaled $11.2 million ($7.0 million after tax or $0.03 per share) in the quarter.
On December 25, 2005, the company completed the expansion and reorganization, with MediaNews Group, of the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership. The company's ownership interest in the partnership was reduced and MediaNews Group became the managing partner. Results for the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership are no longer consolidated in the company's financial statements. The company's 40.6 percent interest in the partnership results is now included in other operating revenues.
As previously reported, the company completed an exchange of properties with Knight Ridder, Inc. in August 2005. This exchange of three Gannett newspapers and Knight Ridder's Tallahassee, FL, newspaper, was accounted for as a sale of discontinued operations and a purchase of the Tallahassee newspaper. Operating results for 2005 exclude contributions from the former Gannett properties which have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations.
Results for the quarter also include the Detroit Newspaper Partnership, L.P. which, since August 1, 2005, has been fully consolidated in the financial statements of Gannett along with a minority interest charge for MediaNews Group's interest.
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Total operating revenues for the company increased 6.5 percent to $1.88 billion in the first quarter from $1.77 billion in the similar interval in 2005. This increase is due primarily to the full consolidation of Detroit newspaper operations. On a pro forma basis, assuming Gannett owned the same complement of properties in the first quarter of 2006 and 2005, total operating revenues would have been 0.5 percent lower. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was $488.2 million compared with $511.6 million in the year earlier quarter. Income from continuing operations was $235.3 million in the first quarter of 2006 versus $260.8 million in the same quarter of last year.
Reported operating expenses increased 10.8 percent in the quarter reflecting principally the full consolidation of Detroit newspaper operations, as well as stock based compensation. On a pro forma basis and excluding stock based compensation, total operating expenses were 0.6 percent higher. Corporate expense totaled $20.5 million for the quarter, an increase of $3.7 million compared to the first quarter in 2005. The increase was due principally to the portion of stock based compensation expense
(more)
attributable to the corporate segment. Excluding that cost, corporate expense increased just $169,000 or 1.0 percent.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter totaled 238,375,000 compared with 254,270,000 in 2005's first quarter.
Commenting on the company's performance, Craig A. Dubow, President and CEO said: "We are pleased to report solid domestic revenue growth for the quarter. In our newspaper segment we reported advertising gains at our U.S. community newspapers, particularly in classified employment and real estate while auto remained soft. Our domestic newspapers continued to enjoy strong success in growing online ad revenues. These results were offset, however, by our Newsquest properties in the UK which experienced significantly lower ad demand due, in part, to the consumer slowdown in the UK economy. The broadcasting group achieved record revenues in the quarter benefiting, in part, from advertising demand related to the Winter Olympics on our 12 NBC affiliated stations and online revenue growth. However, higher newsprint costs and interest expense as well as an unfavorable exchange rate tempered our results."
NEWSPAPERS
Newspaper results in the quarter include Exchange & Mart and Auto Exchange (acquired in September 2005), Tallahassee (acquired in August 2005), 100 percent of the Detroit Newspaper Partnership (established in August 2005), PointRoll, Inc. (acquired in June 2005) and Hometown Communications (acquired in March 2005).
Operating revenues were $1.70 billion for the quarter, a 6.0 percent increase from the first quarter of 2005. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of newspapers in both the first quarter of 2006 and 2005, advertising revenues would have declined 1.8 percent. On a comparable basis, local advertising revenues were 1.8 percent lower, classified was down 1.9 percent and national ad revenues were 1.7 percent lower. On a constant currency basis, total advertising revenues would have been down slightly as classified would have been up 0.5 percent while local and national would have declined 0.9 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. In the U.S., pro forma advertising revenues were up 1.5 percent in the quarter. Total newspaper segment operating cash flow which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties was $424.7 million in the first quarter versus $458.0 million in the same quarter of 2005.
For the quarter, total newspaper operating expenses increased 11.2 percent reflecting the full consolidation of the Detroit newspaper operations and higher newsprint expense. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of properties for the first quarter of 2006 and 2005, pro forma expenses would have increased 0.8 percent. On a pro forma basis and also excluding stock based compensation expense, newspaper segment costs were held to only a 0.3 percent increase including higher newsprint expense. The consolidation of Detroit also had an impact on reported newsprint expense, which increased 13.8 percent in the quarter, reflecting higher newsprint prices and usage. On a pro forma basis, newsprint usage declined.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues declined 4.2 percent in the first quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,020 compared with 1,101 in the same quarter of 2005.

BROADCASTING
Broadcasting revenues totaled $182.6 million for the quarter, a 10.9 percent increase from the first quarter of 2005 and a new record. The increase reflects ad demand associated with the Winter Olympic Games on the company's NBC affiliates and increased revenues at Captivate. Broadcasting achieved a 20.3 percent increase in operating cash flow in the quarter to $79.8 million compared with $66.4 million in the year ago quarter. Broadcasting expenses were 4.6 percent higher in the quarter. Excluding stock based compensation, broadcasting costs would have increased 3.4 percent.
In the first quarter of 2006, television revenues were $177.2 million, a 10.2 percent increase compared to $160.8 million in the first quarter of 2005.
NON-OPERATING ITEMS
Interest expense for the first quarter increased $19.8 million and was $64.7 million compared to $44.9 million in the same quarter of 2005. The increase is attributable to both higher short-term interest rates and debt outstanding related to 2005 share repurchase activity, and acquisitions. Other non-operating expense primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interests and Internet investment costs offset by investment income and gains.
During the first quarter, the company announced that it made a minority investment in 4INFO, a company that offers a comprehensive suite of mobile search services.
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In March, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was approximately 24.1 million unique visitors reaching about 15.6 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracted more than 51.8 million monthly page impressions from approximately 3.8 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONGannett Co., Inc. and SubsidiariesUnaudited, in thousands of dollars
"Operating cash flow", a non-GAAP measure, is defined as operating incomeplus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.  Managementbelieves that use of this measure allows investors and management to measure, analyze and compare the cash resources generated from its business segmentoperations in a meaningful and consistent manner.  The focus on operatingcash flow is appropriate given the consistent and generally predictablestrength of cash flow generation by newspaper and television operations, andthe short period of time it takes to convert new orders to cash.
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's operating income, which the company believes is the most directly comparable financialmeasure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on the company'sconsolidated statements of income, follows:

Gannett Co., Inc. Releases March Statistical Report
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the third period ended March 26, 2006 declined 1.2 percent. Advertising gains were achieved at its domestic newspapers and broadcasting segment but were offset by significantly lower ad demand at its UK properties. For comparison purposes, the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year also affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have increased 0.5 percent for the period.
March
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in March declined 2.0 percent compared with the third period in 2005 on a 2.2 percent decline in ROP volume and a 3.0 percent decline in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have been flat. Newspaper advertising category results in part reflect the impact of a later Easter this year. As in the past, we recommend combining March and April results for comparison purposes.
Pro forma local advertising revenues were 2.7 percent lower on a 4.0 percent decline in ROP ad volume in March. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., across all products, local ad revenue gains were achieved in the furniture, entertainment, health and financial categories while the department store, consumer electronics, grocery, restaurant, telecommunications and home improvement categories lagged last year's comparable period. On a constant currency basis, pro forma local advertising would have been down 1.6 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues declined 1.1 percent in the third period on a 0.5 percent decrease in ROP ad volume. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have been 2.1 percent higher for March. Real estate revenues were up 15.1 percent while employment and automotive revenues declined 3.0 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, compared to last year's third period. On a constant currency basis, real estate would have been up 19.6 percent, employment would have been up slightly and automotive revenues would have been down 15.1 percent. Classified results in our domestic community newspapers were significantly better than in the UK. In the U.S., pro forma classified revenues increased 6.5 percent in the third period comprised of a 31.1 percent increase in real estate revenues and a 9.4 percent increase in employment revenues, while automotive declined 15.0 percent.
(more)
Pro forma national advertising revenues in March were 2.8 percent lower on a 9.3 percent decline in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers was 9.4 percent lower in the period. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 8.4 percent lower on a decline in paid ad pages to 344 from 373. For the third period, at USA TODAY, strength in the automotive, telecommunications, financial, home and building and retail categories was offset by weakness in the travel, technology and pharmaceutical categories.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, increased 2.3 percent in the period. Television revenues were up 0.8 percent for the third period. Local revenues were up 2.8 percent while national revenues were 1.9 percent lower.
First Quarter
For the first quarter of 2006, total pro forma operating revenues were down 0.5 percent but would have increased 0.8 percent on a constant currency basis.
Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the first quarter declined 1.8 percent and would have been down slightly on a constant currency basis. The company's U.S. results were stronger than its UK results as domestic newspaper advertising increased 1.5 percent.
For the first quarter, pro forma local advertising was 1.8 percent lower and would have been 0.9 percent lower on a constant currency basis. Local advertising in the U.S. for the quarter was down slightly.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter were down 1.9 percent but on a constant currency basis would have been 0.5 percent higher. Real estate revenues were 12.0 percent higher, while employment was down 3.9 percent and auto declined 16.9 percent. On a constant currency basis for the quarter, real estate would have been up 15.2 percent while employment and auto would have been down 1.3 percent and 15.1 percent, respectively. For the quarter, classified revenues were up 4.6 percent at our domestic community newspapers with increases in real estate and employment revenues of 22.1 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. Automotive revenues were 13.7 percent lower.
Pro forma national advertising declined 1.7 percent for the first quarter. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, national advertising would have been 1.1 percent lower. At USA TODAY advertising revenues were 4.2 percent lower in the quarter while paid advertising pages were 7.4 percent lower to 1,020 compared to 1,101 in the year-ago period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues for the quarter increased 10.9 percent and television revenues were 10.2 percent higher reflecting, in part, advertising demand related to the Winter Olympic Games in the second period of 2006. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the second quarter of 2006 would be below last year's second quarter in the low single digits.
