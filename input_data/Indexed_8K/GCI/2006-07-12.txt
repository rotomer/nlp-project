News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, July 12, 2006
Gannett Co., Inc. Reports Second Quarter Results
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2006 second quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.31 compared to $1.34 per share in the second quarter of 2005. In the second quarter of 2006, the company recorded stock compensation expense of $10.3 million ($6.4 million after tax or $0.03 per share).
The company completed the expansion and reorganization, with MediaNews Group, of the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership on December 25, 2005. Results for the partnership are no longer consolidated in the company's financial statements. The company's 40.6 percent interest in the partnership results is now included in other operating revenues.
As previously reported, the company completed an exchange of properties with Knight Ridder, Inc. in August 2005. Operating results for 2005 exclude contributions from the former Gannett properties which have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations. The Detroit Newspaper Partnership, L.P. has been fully consolidated in the financial statements of Gannett along with a minority interest charge for MediaNews Group's interest since August 1, 2005.
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Total operating revenues for the company increased 6.1 percent to $2.03 billion in the second quarter from $1.91 billion in the similar interval in 2005. This increase is due primarily to the full consolidation of Detroit newspaper operations. On a pro forma basis, assuming Gannett owned the same complement of properties in the second quarter of 2006 and 2005, total operating revenues would have been 0.5 percent higher. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was $606.4 million compared with $623.7 million in the year earlier quarter. However, excluding stock compensation expense, operating cash flow was $7.1 million or 1.1 percent lower. Income from continuing operations was $310.5 million in the second quarter of 2006 versus $332.6 million in the same quarter of last year. Again, excluding stock based compensation expense, income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2006 was $316.9 million.
Reported operating expenses increased 9.5 percent in the quarter reflecting principally the full consolidation of Detroit newspaper operations, as well as stock based compensation. On a pro forma basis and excluding stock based compensation, total operating expenses were 1.0 percent higher, primarily reflecting higher newsprint expense. Corporate expense totaled $20.3 million for the quarter, a $3.0 million increase compared to the second quarter in 2005. The increase was due principally to the portion of stock based compensation expense attributable to the corporate segment. Excluding that cost, corporate expense would have been flat for the quarter.
(more)
Average diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter totaled 237,767,000 compared with 248,009,000 in 2005's second quarter. Approximately 1.3 million shares were repurchased during the current quarter.
Commenting on the company's performance, Craig A. Dubow, Chairman, President and CEO said: "Our performance in the quarter was in line with expectations and continues to reflect the unevenness of the advertising environment in the various markets we serve. Our domestic community newspapers generated advertising gains during the quarter, particularly in the local and real estate categories. Our efforts in both digital, and niche publications again were strong contributors to our growth. Our positive domestic results were partially offset by continued soft ad demand at our UK operations although we are seeing some signs of stabilization in that market. Our Broadcasting segment reported higher revenues driven by politically related ad demand and significant online revenue growth.  However, higher newsprint and interest costs, stock compensation expense and an unfavorable exchange rate tempered our results."
NEWSPAPERS
Newspaper results in the quarter include Exchange & Mart and Auto Exchange (acquired in September 2005), Tallahassee (acquired in August 2005), 100 percent of the Detroit Newspaper Partnership (established in August 2005), PointRoll, Inc. (acquired in June 2005) and Hometown Communications (acquired in March 2005).
Operating revenues were $1.82 billion for the quarter, a 6.4 percent increase from the second quarter of 2005. Reported advertising revenues were 6.4 percent higher for the quarter. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of newspapers in both the second quarter of 2006 and 2005, advertising revenues would have increased 0.3 percent. On a comparable basis, local advertising revenues were 2.8 percent higher, national ad revenues were 0.8 percent lower and classified was down 1.7 percent. On a constant currency basis, total advertising revenues would have been up 0.6 percent; local would have been up 3.0 percent and national and classified would have declined 0.6 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. In the U.S., pro forma advertising revenues were up 2.2 percent in the quarter. Total newspaper segment operating cash flow which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties was $521.1 million in the second quarter versus $538.4 million in the same quarter of 2005.
For the quarter, total newspaper operating expenses increased 9.8 percent reflecting the full consolidation of the Detroit newspaper operations and higher newsprint expense. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of properties for the second quarter of 2006 and 2005, pro forma expenses would have increased 1.3 percent. On a pro forma basis and also excluding stock based compensation expense, newspaper segment costs were held to a 0.9 percent increase, which includes higher newsprint expense. The consolidation of Detroit also had an impact on reported newsprint expense, which increased 12.2 percent in the quarter, reflecting higher newsprint prices and usage. On a pro forma basis, however, newsprint expense increased 5.2 percent.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were up 0.7 percent in the second quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,107 compared with 1,191 in the same quarter of 2005.

BROADCASTING
Broadcasting generated revenues of $205.4 million for the quarter, a 3.8 percent increase from the second quarter of 2005. The increase reflects stronger politically related ad demand, a 63 percent increase in online revenues as well as higher revenues at Captivate. Operating cash flow in the quarter totaled $101.4 million compared with $98.7 million in the year ago quarter. Broadcasting expenses were 4.7 percent higher in the quarter. Excluding stock based compensation, broadcasting costs would have increased 3.4 percent.
In the second quarter of 2006, television revenues were $199.0 million, a 3.2 percent increase compared to $192.8 million in the second quarter of 2005.
NON-OPERATING ITEMS
Interest expense for the second quarter increased $19.0 million and was $67.4 million compared to $48.4 million in the same quarter of 2005. The increase is attributable to higher short-term interest rates and debt outstanding. During the quarter the company issued $1.25 billion in debt comprised of $750 million in three-year, floating rate notes with interest based on 3-month LIBOR and $500 million in five-year, fixed rate notes with a coupon of 5.75 percent. Other non-operating expense primarily reflects non-operating charges for minority interests and Internet investment costs in part offset by investment income and gains.
The company announced during the quarter that it had acquired Planet Discover, a provider of local, integrated online search and advertising technology. It also announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire WATL-TV in Atlanta which will create the company's third duopoly. The transaction will close at the conclusion of a regulatory review. The company contributed the Muskogee (OK) Phoenix to the Gannett Foundation in April, 2006. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, the company established its second duopoly when it completed the acquisition of KTVD-TV in Denver.
On June 29th, the company announced that Craig A. Dubow was elected Chairman effective July 1st.
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In June, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was approximately 22.2 million unique visitors reaching over 14 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracted more than 46.1 million monthly page impressions from approximately 3.5 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONGannett Co., Inc. and SubsidiariesUnaudited, in thousands of dollars
"Operating cash flow", a non-GAAP measure, is defined as operating incomeplus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.  Managementbelieves that use of this measure allows investors and management tomeasure, analyze and compare the cash resources generated from itsbusiness segment operations in a meaningful and consistent manner.  Thefocus on operating cash flow is appropriate given the consistent andgenerally predictable strength of cash flow generation by newspaper andtelevision operations, and the short period of time it takes to convert neworders to cash.
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's operatingincome, which the company believes is the most directly comparable financialmeasure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on the company'sconsolidated statements of income, follows:

News Release 
Wednesday, July 12, 2006
Gannett Co., Inc. Releases June Statistical Report
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the sixth period ended June 25, 2006 increased 1.1 percent resulting from an increase in ad demand at its domestic community newspapers and broadcasting segment offset, partially, by soft ad demand at its UK properties. For comparison purposes, the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year also affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have been 0.7 percent higher for the period.
June
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in June increased 1.0 percent compared with the sixth period in 2005. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have been up 0.6 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues were 4.0 percent higher on a 1.4 percent increase in ROP ad volume in June. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., across all products, local ad revenue gains were achieved in the financial, home improvement and office supplies categories while the department stores, consumer electronics, grocery and telecommunication categories lagged last year's comparable period. On a constant currency basis, pro forma local advertising would have been 3.8 percent higher.
Pro forma classified revenues decreased 0.6 percent in the sixth period on a 2.0 percent decline in ROP ad volume. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have been 1.3 percent lower for June. Real estate revenues were up 13.4 percent while employment and automotive revenues declined 4.6 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively. On a constant currency basis, real estate would have been 12.5 percent higher, employment would have been down 5.2 percent and automotive revenues would have been 15.8 percent lower. Classified results in our domestic community newspapers were better than in the UK. In the U.S., pro forma classified revenues increased 1.2 percent in the sixth period comprised of an 18.6 percent increase in real estate revenues and a 1.0 percent decline in employment revenues, while automotive was 14.6 percent lower.
Pro forma national advertising revenues in June were 2.3 percent lower on a 7.0 percent decline in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers was down 7.1 percent in the period. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 1.2 percent lower on a decline in paid ad pages to 309 from 363. For the sixth period, at USA TODAY, strong growth in the

financial, telecommunications, home and building, advocacy and real estate categories was offset by weakness in the automotive, technology, travel, retail and packaged goods categories.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, increased 3.3 percent in the period buoyed by politically-related ad demand. Television revenues were up 3.8 percent for the sixth period. Local revenues increased 3.1 percent while national revenues were 3.4 percent higher.
Second Quarter
For the second quarter of 2006, total pro forma operating revenues were up 0.5 percent but would have been 0.8 percent higher on a constant currency basis.
Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the second quarter were up 0.3 percent and would have been up 0.6 percent on a constant currency basis. The company's U.S. results were stronger than its UK results as domestic newspaper advertising increased 2.2 percent.
For the second quarter, pro forma local advertising was 2.8 percent higher and would have been up 3.0 percent on a constant currency basis. Local advertising in the U.S. for the quarter was up 3.4 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter decreased 1.7 percent and on a constant currency basis would have been 1.2 percent lower. Real estate revenues were 10.7 percent higher, while employment was down 5.1 percent and auto was 15.3 percent lower. On a constant currency basis for the quarter, real estate would have been up 11.4 percent while employment and auto would have been down 4.6 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively. For the quarter, classified revenues were up 1.9 percent at our domestic community newspapers with increases in real estate and employment revenues of 16.7 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. Automotive revenues were 12.7 percent lower.
Pro forma national advertising was down 0.8 percent for the second quarter. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, national advertising would have been 0.6 percent lower. At USA TODAY advertising revenues were 0.7 percent higher in the quarter while paid advertising pages were 1,107 compared to 1,191 in the year-ago period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues for the quarter increased 3.8 percent and television revenues were 3.2 percent higher reflecting stronger political advertising. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the third quarter of 2006 would be ahead of last year's third quarter in the low single digits.
