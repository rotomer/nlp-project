Gannett Co., Inc. Reports Third Quarter Results
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2006 third quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.11 compared with $1.13 per share in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding stock compensation expense this quarter of $10.3 million ($6.4 million after tax or $0.03 per share), diluted earnings per share would have been above last year's third quarter result.
"Our performance this quarter was led by top-of-the-industry television results, fueled by strong political advertising demand. Our online and non-daily efforts again contributed positively. All of this was achieved despite the challenging advertising environment, uncertain economic outlook, higher interest and newsprint costs, and stock compensation expense," said Craig Dubow, chairman, president and CEO of Gannett.
"As always," Dubow added, "I am proud of the disciplined financial management shown throughout the company which, coupled with our strategies to grow the many facets of our news and information business, are keys to our future growth."
Reported results for the quarter and year-to-date include KTVD-TV in Denver and WATL-TV in Atlanta which the company acquired during the third quarter, creating Gannett's second and third duopolies.
As previously reported, the company completed the expansion and reorganization, with MediaNews Group, of the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership on December 25, 2005. Results for the partnership are no longer consolidated in the company's financial statements. The company's 40.6 percent interest in the partnership results is now included in other operating revenues.
Gannett also completed an exchange of properties with Knight Ridder, Inc. in August 2005. Operating results for 2005 exclude contributions from the former Gannett properties which have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations. The Detroit Newspaper Partnership, L.P. has been fully consolidated in the financial statements of Gannett along with a minority interest charge for MediaNews Group's interest since August 1, 2005.
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Total operating revenues for the company were $1.91 billion in the third quarter a 2.7 percent increase from the third quarter of 2005. The increase reflected higher politically related advertising demand, the acquisitions of KTVD-TV and WATL-TV and the full consolidation of Detroit newspaper operations. On a pro forma basis, assuming Gannett owned the same complement of properties in the third quarters of 2006 and 2005, total operating revenues would have been up slightly. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was $524.3 million compared with

$540.9 million in the same quarter of last year. However, excluding stock compensation expense, operating cash flow was $534.6 million, a decline of 1.2 percent. Income from continuing operations was $261.4 million in the third quarter of 2006 compared with $274.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2006 excluding stock based compensation expense was $267.8 million.
Reported operating expenses were 4.9 percent higher in the quarter resulting principally from the full consolidation of Detroit newspaper operations, newsprint expense, stock compensation expense and the acquisitions of KTVD and WATL. On a pro forma basis and excluding stock-based compensation, total operating expenses increased 1.2 percent reflecting primarily higher newsprint expense. Corporate expenses increased $2.7 million to $19.4 million compared with the third quarter of 2005 reflecting stock- based compensation attributed to the corporate segment. Corporate expenses, excluding stock compensation expense, were 3.6 percent lower for the quarter.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter totaled 236,234,000 compared with 244,013,000 in 2005's third quarter. Approximately 2.6 million shares were repurchased during the current quarter.
NEWSPAPERS
Newspaper results in the quarter include Exchange & Mart and Auto Exchange (acquired in September 2005), the Tallahassee, FL, newspaper (acquired in August 2005) and 100 percent of the Detroit Newspaper Partnership (established in August 2005).
Operating revenues totaled $1.7 billion for the third quarter, a 1.2 percent increase from the same interval in 2005. Reported advertising revenues were up slightly for the quarter. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of newspapers in both the third quarters of 2006 and 2005, advertising revenues would have been 1.2 percent lower. On a comparable basis, local advertising revenues were almost 1 percent higher, national ad revenues decreased 3.4 percent and classified revenues were down 2.3 percent. Total advertising revenues on a constant currency basis would have been down 2.0 percent as local would have been up 0.4 percent and national and classified would have been 3.7 percent and 3.6 percent lower, respectively. In the U.S., pro forma advertising revenues were 1.0 percent lower in the quarter. Total newspaper segment operating cash flow, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, was $451.5 million in the third quarter.
Total newspaper operating expenses increased 4.2 percent, reflecting primarily the full consolidation of the Detroit newspaper operations and higher newsprint expense. Pro forma newspaper expenses - assuming Gannett had owned the same group of properties for the third quarters of 2006 and 2005 - would have been up 1.3 percent. On a pro forma basis and excluding stock-based compensation expense, newspaper segment costs increased less than 1 percent including higher newsprint expense. Reported newsprint expense, which was impacted by the consolidation of Detroit, increased 6.6 percent reflecting higher newsprint prices offset by lower usage. On a pro forma basis, however, newsprint expense was 4.4 percent higher for the quarter.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were up 1.0 percent in the third quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 912 compared with 981 in the year-ago quarter.

BROADCASTING
Broadcasting segment results for the quarter include WATL-TV (acquired in August 2006) and KTVD-TV (acquired in June 2006).
Broadcasting revenues advanced 17.9 percent to $196.2 million for the quarter due to a significant increase in politically related advertising demand and the television station acquisitions. In the third quarter, television revenues increased 18.5 percent to $191.5 million compared to $161.5 million in the same quarter a year ago. Assuming Gannett had owned the same group of stations in both the third quarters of 2006 and 2005, broadcasting revenues would have been 11.1 percent higher. Reported broadcasting expenses were 10.9 percent higher in the quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation, and on a pro forma basis, broadcasting costs would have been 5.8 percent higher. Operating cash flow jumped 27.6 percent to $88.1 million, compared to $69.0 million in the third quarter of 2005.
NON-OPERATING ITEMS
Interest expense for the third quarter was $75 million versus $55 million for the same quarter of 2005. The increase is attributable to higher short-term interest rates and higher debt outstanding. Other non operating income reflects higher investment income, substantially lower losses from our digital investments and the absence in 2006 of the minority interest charge for the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership.
During the quarter, the company increased its equity stakes in CareerBuilder and ShopLocal.com to 42.5 percent and in Topix.net to 31.9 percent.
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In September, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was approximately 24 million unique visitors reaching over 15 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracted more than 51 million monthly page impressions from approximately 3.6 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONGannett Co., Inc. and SubsidiariesUnaudited, in thousands of dollars
"Operating cash flow", a non-GAAP measure, is defined as operating incomeplus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.  Managementbelieves that use of this measure allows investors and management tomeasure, analyze and compare the cash resources generated from itsbusiness segment operations in a meaningful and consistent manner.  Thefocus on operating cash flow is appropriate given the consistent andgenerally predictable strength of cash flow generation by newspaper andtelevision operations, and the short period of time it takes to convert neworders to cash.
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP amounts to the company's operatingincome, which the company believes is the most directly comparable financialmeasure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on the company'sconsolidated statements of income, follows:

News Release
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, October 11, 2006
Gannett Co., Inc. Releases September Statistical Report
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the ninth period ended September 24, 2006 decreased 0.7 percent resulting from higher advertising demand in its broadcasting segment offset by lower revenues in its newspaper segment. For comparison purposes, the exchange rate of Sterling year-over-year also affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have been 1.4 percent lower for the period.
September
Pro forma (assuming that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods) newspaper advertising revenues in September were 3.2 percent lower compared with the ninth period in 2005 on declines of 3.2 percent in ROP volume and 3.0 percent in preprint distribution. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have been down 3.9 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues were 0.8 percent lower on a 2.3 percent decline in ROP ad volume in September. The performance of the company's small and medium-sized advertisers in its domestic newspapers outpaced the revenue performance of its largest advertisers. In the U.S., across all products, local ad revenue gains were achieved in the health, restaurant and home improvement categories while the department store, furniture, grocery, consumer electronics, financial and telecommunications categories lagged last year's comparable period. On a constant currency basis, pro forma local advertising would have been 1.3 percent lower.
Pro forma classified revenues decreased 2.9 percent in the ninth period on a 2.3 percent decrease in ROP ad volume. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have been 4.2 percent lower for September. Real estate revenues were up 5.5 percent while employment revenues were down 7.1 percent and automotive revenues were 10.1 percent lower. On a constant currency basis, real estate would have been 3.9 percent higher, employment would have been down 8.4 percent and automotive revenues would have been 11.0 percent lower. In the U.S., at our community newspapers pro forma classified revenues were 4.0 percent lower in the ninth period comprised of a 5.6 percent increase in real estate revenues, a 7.8 percent decline in employment revenue and automotive which was 12.7 percent lower.
Pro forma national advertising revenues in September were 9.5 percent lower on a 19.9 percent decline in ad volume. National volume at the company's local domestic newspapers was down 22.4 percent in the period due in part to the absence of advertising demand related to the hurricanes in September of 2005. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 0.3 percent lower on a decline in paid ad pages to 358 from 375.

For the ninth period, at USA TODAY, strong growth in the entertainment, telecommunications, retail, real estate and pharmaceutical categories was offset by weakness in the automotive, travel, financial, packaged goods and advocacy categories.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, increased 14.2 percent in the period buoyed by higher politically related advertising demand. Television revenues were up 14.4 percent for the ninth period. National revenues were 23.6 percent higher while local revenues increased 7.5 percent.
Third Quarter
For the third quarter of 2006, total pro forma operating revenues were 0.3 percent higher and would have been 0.4 percent lower on a constant currency basis.
Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the third quarter were down 1.2 percent and would have been 2.0 percent lower on a constant currency basis. The company's domestic newspaper advertising revenue decreased 1.0 percent.
For the third quarter, pro forma local advertising was 0.8 percent higher and would have been up 0.4 percent on a constant currency basis. Local advertising in the U.S. for the quarter was up almost 1 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter declined 2.3 percent and on a constant currency basis would have been 3.6 percent lower. Real estate revenues were 8.2 percent higher, while employment was down 6.2 percent and automotive was 9.5 percent lower. On a constant currency basis for the quarter, real estate would have been up 6.6 percent while employment and automotive would have been down 7.4 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively. For the quarter, classified revenues were down 1.8 percent at our domestic community newspapers with a 9.1 percent increase in real estate offset by declines in employment and automotive revenues of 6.0 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively.
Pro forma national advertising was 3.4 percent lower for the third quarter. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, national advertising would have been down 3.7 percent. At USA TODAY advertising revenues were 1.0 percent higher in the quarter while paid advertising pages totaled 912 compared to 981 in the year-ago period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues for the quarter increased 11.1 percent and television revenues were up 11.4 percent reflecting significantly higher revenues associated with politically related ad demand. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 would be ahead of last year's fourth quarter in the mid to high single digits.
In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share for September from Nielsen//Net Ratings.
