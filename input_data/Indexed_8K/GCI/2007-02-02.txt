IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Gannett Co., Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and 2006 Full-Year Results
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2006 fourth quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.51 compared with $1.44 per share in the fourth quarter of 2005, a 4.9 percent increase. The results for the quarter include stock compensation expense of $12.7 million ($7.9 million after tax or $0.03 per share).
"We are pleased to report record revenues for the year, surpassing $8.0 billion for the first time. We achieved these results in a year of interesting challenges as well as opportunities," said Craig Dubow, chairman, president and CEO of Gannett. "In addition, we have moved forward in significant ways on our strategic initiatives and are positioning the company for future growth."
"For the quarter, our results in the newspaper segment reflect higher advertising demand particularly for local advertising, a strong finish at USA TODAY and double digit digital revenue growth. A record level of politically related advertising demand for the quarter drove strong revenue growth in our broadcasting segment. Our results, however, were unfavorably impacted by higher newsprint, stock compensation and interest costs," he added.
Gannett's fiscal year included 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks in 2005. The fourth quarter was comprised of 14 weeks compared with 13 weeks in the same quarter of 2005. All of the company's results detailed below were impacted by the extra week in 2006.
Reported results for the quarter and year include KTVD-TV in Denver and WATL-TV in Atlanta which the company acquired during the third quarter of 2006.
As previously reported, the company completed the expansion and reorganization, with MediaNews Group, of the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership on December 25, 2005. Results for the partnership are no longer consolidated in the company's financial statements. The company's 40.6 percent interest in the partnership results is now included in other operating revenues.
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Total operating revenues for the company were $2.21 billion in the fourth quarter, a 7.5 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase reflected higher advertising demand in the newspaper and broadcasting segments, television station acquisitions and the additional week in the quarter. Total operating revenues would have been 7.8 percent higher on a pro forma basis (assuming Gannett owned the same complement of properties in the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005). Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was

$656.1 million compared to $646.2 million in the same quarter of last year. Operating cash flow excluding stock compensation expense increased 3.5 percent to $668.7 million. Net income was $353.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with $343.3 million in the year-ago quarter.
Reported operating expenses totaled $1.62 billion for the quarter, an increase of 9.8 percent. The increase reflected higher newsprint costs, stock compensation expense, acquisitions and severance expenses related to a number of efficiency efforts in the UK and U.S., including the consolidation of circulation call centers. Corporate expenses increased 25.4 percent to $21.7 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2005 reflecting stock-based compensation. Corporate expenses excluding stock compensation expense were slightly higher for the quarter.
For the year, total operating revenues were $8.03 billion, a 5.7 percent increase from 2005. On a pro forma basis, total operating revenues would have been 2.1 percent higher. Operating cash flow totaled $2.28 billion for the year versus $2.32 billion in 2005. However, excluding stock-based compensation of $47 million, operating cash flow was on a par with last year's result. Net income was $1.16 billion versus $1.21 billion in 2005.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter totaled 234,790,000 compared with 239,128,000 in 2005's fourth quarter. Average diluted shares outstanding for all of 2006 were 236,756,000 versus 246,256,000 in 2005.
NEWSPAPERS
Newspaper segment operating revenues totaled $1.94 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 4.9 percent from the same interval in 2005. Reported advertising revenues were up 3.7 percent to $1.45 billion for the quarter. Advertising revenues would have been 5.3 percent higher if Gannett had owned the same group of newspapers in both the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005. Local advertising revenues were up 6.6 percent, national ad revenues were 9.1 percent higher and classified revenues increased 1.7 percent on a comparable basis. In the U.S., pro forma advertising revenues were up 4.9 percent. Operating cash flow for the total newspaper segment, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, was $526.4 million in the fourth quarter.
Total newspaper operating expenses increased 8.3 percent, reflecting stock-based compensation expense, higher newsprint expense, consolidation costs and operating costs from the extra week in the quarter. Reported newsprint expense was 6.4 percent higher for the quarter due to higher newsprint prices partially offset by lower volume.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 13.0 percent higher in the fourth quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,348 compared with 1,226 in the year-ago quarter. For the full year, USA TODAY's advertising revenues increased 3.1 percent and paid pages totaled 4,387.
BROADCASTING
Broadcasting segment results for the quarter and year include WATL-TV (acquired in August 2006) and KTVD-TV (acquired in June 2006).
(more)
Broadcasting revenues (which include Captivate) increased 30.3 percent to $270.6 million for the quarter due to a record level of politically related advertising demand, strong revenue growth at Captivate and revenue from the television stations acquired in the third quarter. Substantially higher online revenues also contributed to the growth. Broadcasting revenues would have been up 22.0 percent if Gannett had owned the same group of stations in both the fourth quarters of 2006 and 2005. Reported broadcasting expenses were 26.1 percent higher in the quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation, and on a pro forma basis, broadcasting costs would have been up 16.7 percent. Operating cash flow increased 36.6 percent to $147.4 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2005.
Television revenues were $260.6 million or 29.1 percent higher in the fourth quarter compared to $201.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. On a pro forma basis, television revenues would have been 20.7 percent higher. Reported television expenses grew 26.8 percent and would have been up 16.8 percent on a pro forma basis and excluding stock-based compensation.
NON-OPERATING ITEMS
Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $80.9 million versus $62.3 million for the same quarter a year ago due to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income primarily reflected gains recorded on the sale of Internet investments, the absence of the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership minority interest charge and substantially lower losses from digital investments. This was partially offset by non-operating charges for minority interests.
* * * *
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In December, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was approximately 22.1 million unique visitors reaching 13.7 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracted more than 43 million monthly page impressions from approximately 3.3 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

News Release
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Friday, February 2, 2007
Gannett Co., Inc. Releases December Statistical Report
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the twelfth period increased 19.2 percent, compared with the twelfth period in 2005. The twelfth period in 2006, which ended on December 31, spanned five weeks this year instead of the usual four so comparisons are not fully representative of current trends. Without the extra week, total pro forma operating revenues would have been 1.6 percent higher. Pro forma assumes all properties presently owned were owned in both periods.
December
Pro forma newspaper advertising revenues in the five-week December period were up 17.5 percent, compared with the twelfth period in 2005. This was based on increases of 19.2 percent in ROP volume and 13.6 percent in preprint distribution. Excluding the extra week in the twelfth period, pro forma newspaper advertising revenues would have been up 1.2 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues increased 17.3 percent on 17.8 percent higher ROP ad volume in the five-week December period. In the U.S., across all products, all categories except financial and home improvement were ahead of last year. Excluding the fifth week in the period, pro forma local advertising revenue would have increased 1.3 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues were 14.2 percent higher in the five-week twelfth period on a 20.4 percent increase in ROP ad volume. Real estate revenues were up 11.1 percent; employment revenues were 9.8 percent higher; and automotive revenues rose 12.9 percent. At our U.S. community newspapers, pro forma classified revenues were 12.7 percent higher for the five-week period. That increase includes growth of 6.7 percent in real estate revenues, 7.2 percent in employment revenues and 14.6 percent in automotive revenues. Pro forma classified revenues would have been flat on a four-week to four-week comparison.
Pro forma national advertising revenues for the five-week December period were 23.8 percent higher on an 18.9 percent increase in ad volume. At our local domestic newspapers, national volume was up 17.1 percent in the period. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 24.4 percent higher on an increase in paid ad pages to 538 from 429. During the first four weeks of the period, paid ad pages were 10.9 percent higher. In the twelfth period, USA TODAY posted strong growth in all categories except the technology and advocacy categories.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, were up 16.1 percent for the five-week December period. Television revenues increased 14.2 percent for the twelfth period. National

revenues were 18.5 percent higher, while local revenues increased 11.8 percent. Excluding the fifth week, television revenues decreased 4.4 percent.
Fourth Quarter
For the fourth quarter of 2006, total pro forma operating revenues were 7.8 percent higher. The fourth quarter was comprised of 14 weeks in 2006 versus 13 weeks in 2005. Excluding the extra week, pro forma operating revenues would have increased 2.4 percent.
Pro forma newspaper advertising revenues for the quarter were up 5.3 percent. Excluding the extra week, pro forma advertising revenues were up slightly. The company's domestic advertising revenues were 4.9 percent higher but would have been down 0.6 percent on a 13-week to 13-week comparison basis.
For the quarter, pro forma local advertising increased 6.6 percent. Excluding the extra week, pro forma local advertising revenues would have been up 1.3 percent. Local advertising in the U.S. was 6.2 percent higher for the quarter and would have been up almost 1 percent excluding the extra week.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter increased 1.7 percent. Real estate revenues were 4.7 percent higher, while employment was down 1.8 percent and automotive was 4.2 percent lower. Classified revenues would have been down 2.2 percent excluding the extra week. For the 14-week quarter, classified revenues were up slightly at our domestic community newspapers. That increase was comprised of a 1.6 percent increase in real estate offset by a 4.4 percent decline in employment and a 3.4 percent decline in automotive revenues.
Pro forma national advertising revenues were 9.1 percent higher for quarter. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues increased 13.0 percent in the quarter. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,348 compared with 1,226 in the year-ago period. Excluding the extra week in the quarter, national advertising would have been 2.2 percent higher.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues were 22.0 percent higher and television revenues were up 20.7 percent. In a 13-week to 13-week comparison, broadcasting revenues increased 16.6 percent, reflecting higher politically related ad demand. Captivate also helped. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the first quarter of 2007 would lag last year's first quarter in the mid-to-high single digits, reflecting primarily the absence of over $22 million of Olympic revenue that benefited last year's first quarter.
