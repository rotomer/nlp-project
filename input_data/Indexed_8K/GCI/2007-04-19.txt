FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Thursday, April 19, 2007
Gannett Co., Inc. Reports First Quarter Results
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2007 first quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.90 compared with $0.99 per share in the first quarter of 2006.
"Results for the quarter were in line with expectations. On the positive side, our operations in the UK contributed to our results as did online revenue company wide. Our broadcasting segment posted positive revenue growth. The acquisition of the additional television stations in Denver and Atlanta, and strong results for Captivate and online, offset the absence of over $22 million of Olympic-related ad spending.
"However, advertising demand was tempered by severe weather, the absence of the final week in the calendar year, which was included in the first quarter of 2006, and the softening domestic real estate market. Our non-operating results also were impacted by the gain on the sale of the Cincinnati Reds a year ago and higher interest expense," said Craig A. Dubow, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
"Executing on our strategic plan and delivering profitable top-line revenue growth continues to be our focus. We are seeing early successes and are gaining traction in our local communities particularly through our Information Center efforts," he added.
Reported results for the current quarter include KTVD-TV in Denver and WATL-TV in Atlanta which the company acquired during the third quarter of 2006.
Total operating revenues for the company were $1.87 billion in the first quarter compared to $1.88 billion in the first quarter of 2006 reflecting the absence of revenue associated with the Olympics in 2006's first quarter, softer advertising demand at our domestic newspaper properties and tough year-over-year comparisons. Total operating revenues would have been 1.2 percent lower on a pro forma basis assuming Gannett owned the same complement of properties in the first quarters of 2007 and 2006. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was $471.6 million compared to $488.2 million in the same quarter a year ago. Net income was $210.6 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared with $235.3 million in the year-ago quarter.
Reported operating expenses totaled $1.47 billion for the quarter, an increase of less than one percent reflecting continuing strong cost controls, a slight increase in newsprint expense, the impact of the television station acquisitions and a higher exchange rate for the British pound. On a pro forma basis, total operating expenses were 0.2 percent higher. Corporate expenses increased 12.6 percent to $23.1 million compared to $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2006 due entirely to the timing of stock-based compensation awards.
(more)
Average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter totaled 235,005,000 compared with 238,375,000 in 2006's first quarter. During the quarter, approximately 177,600 shares were repurchased.
NEWSPAPERS
Newspaper segment operating revenues totaled $1.69 billion for the first quarter, a 0.7 percent decline compared to the first quarter of 2006. Reported advertising revenues were down 1.9 percent to $1.24 billion for the quarter while circulation revenue was unchanged at $324.0 million. Advertising revenues would have been 1.8 percent lower if Gannett had owned the same group of newspapers in both the first quarters of 2007 and 2006. On a comparable basis, local advertising revenues increased 0.6 percent, national advertising revenues were 4.8 percent lower and classified revenues were down 3.0 percent. In the UK, pro forma advertising revenues were 1.4 percent higher on a constant currency basis while in the U.S. pro forma advertising revenues were down 4.8 percent. Operating cash flow for the total newspaper segment, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, was $417.8 million in the first quarter.
Total newspaper operating expenses were flat for the quarter reflecting effective cost control and a 0.2 percent increase in newsprint expense. The slight increase in newsprint expense reflected higher newsprint prices that were offset by substantially lower usage.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 7.9 percent lower in the quarter compared with the first quarter of 2006 due, in part, to the absence of Olympic-related ad demand. Paid advertising pages totaled 904 compared with 1,012 in the year-ago quarter.
BROADCASTING
Broadcasting segment results for the quarter include WATL-TV (acquired in August 2006) and KTVD-TV (acquired in June 2006).
Broadcasting revenues (which include Captivate) increased slightly to $183.1 million in the first quarter. This reflected revenue from the acquired television stations, a 16.7 percent increase in Captivate revenues and strong revenue gains for our television stations' online operations, offset by the absence of significant ad demand related to the Olympics. Broadcasting revenues would have been 6.3 percent lower if Gannett had owned the same group of stations in both the first quarters of 2007 and 2006. Reported broadcasting expenses increased 7.3 percent in the quarter. However, on a pro forma basis, broadcasting costs would have been less than 1 percent higher. Operating cash flow was $72.9 million in the first quarter.
Reported television revenues were $176.8 million in the first quarter compared to $177.2 million in the same quarter a year ago.
NON-OPERATING ITEMS
Interest expense was $72.9 million in the first quarter compared to $64.7 million for the same quarter a year ago due to higher interest rates. The increase in other non-operating expense primarily reflects the absence of the gain on the sale of our small ownership interest in the Cincinnati Reds in the first quarter of 2006.
(more)
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company announced the sale of the Norwich (CT) Bulletin; the Rockford (IL) Register Star; the Observer-Dispatch in Utica, NY; and The Herald-Dispatch in Huntington, WV for $410 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2007. After closing, all previously reported results for these properties, as well as a gain from the sale, will be included in discontinued operations.
* * * *
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In March, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was approximately 23.1 million unique visitors reaching 14.6 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracted more than 70 million monthly page impressions from approximately 4.8 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

News Release
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Thursday, April 19, 2007
Gannett Co., Inc. Releases March Statistical Report
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the third period ended April 1, 2007 declined 0.8 percent compared with the third period in 2006. For comparison purposes, the strengthening exchange rate of the British Pound also affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenue would have been 2.7 percent lower.
March
Pro forma newspaper advertising revenues in March were down 2.0 percent, compared with March 2006. Pro forma assumes all properties presently owned were owned in both periods. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising would have been 4.1 percent lower.
Pro forma local advertising revenues increased 1.8 percent in the third period. In the U.S., across all products, local ad revenue gains were achieved in the grocery, health, restaurants, telecommunications and office supplies categories while the department stores, furniture, consumer electronics and financial categories declined compared to last year. On a constant currency basis, local advertising would have been 0.5 percent higher.
Pro forma classified revenues declined 5.1 percent in the third period. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have been 8.4 percent lower. Real estate revenues were down 5.6 percent, employment revenues were 4.5 percent lower, and automotive revenues declined 14.6 percent while other classified revenues increased 4.5 percent. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, real estate would have been 9.2 percent lower, employment would have declined 7.7 percent and automotive would have been down 17.3 percent. Classified results in the UK were better than in the U.S. community newspapers due, in part, to difficult comparisons at the U.S. properties. At our U.S. community newspapers, pro forma classified revenues were 11.1 percent lower for the third period reflecting declines of 15.3 percent in real estate revenues, 10.8 percent in employment revenues and 15.1 percent in automotive revenues. For comparison purposes, real estate was up 31.1 percent and employment was 9.4 percent higher at our domestic community newspapers in March a year ago. Classified revenues at Newsquest in the UK were down 2.7 percent, in pounds. Increases in real estate of 1.8 percent and other classified of 5.1 percent were offset by declines of 1.0 percent in employment and 22.4 percent in automotive.
Pro forma national advertising revenues for the third period were 3.1 percent lower. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 3.7 percent lower on paid ad pages of 303 versus 341 last year. In the third period at USA TODAY, growth in the travel, telecommunications, pharmaceutical,

packaged goods and restaurant categories was offset by weakness in the automotive, entertainment, financial and retail categories.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, were 2.4 percent higher for March. Television revenues increased 2.7 percent in the period reflecting a 3.8 percent increase in local revenues and a 1.6 percent decline in national revenues.
Other revenue rose 7.8 percent in the third period due primarily to increases in commercial printing and PointRoll.
First Quarter
For the first quarter of 2007, total pro forma operating revenues were 1.2 percent lower and would have declined 2.8 percent on a constant currency basis reflecting, in part, the absence of $22 million of Olympic revenues and the absence of the final week of December (which was included in the first quarter of 2006), which has been a traditionally strong week for advertising in the U.S. Severe weather in the quarter also held back ad spending.
Pro forma newspaper advertising revenues for the quarter were down 1.8 percent and would have been 3.7 percent lower on a constant currency basis. The company's UK results were stronger than its U.S. results as advertising at our domestic community newspapers declined 4.8 percent while ad revenues in the UK advanced 1.4 percent, in pounds.
For the quarter, pro forma local advertising was 0.6 percent higher and would have been 0.5 percent lower on a constant currency basis. Local advertising in the U.S. declined 0.6 percent for the quarter due in part to the switch of the final week of December.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter declined 3.0 percent. Real estate revenues were 1.5 percent lower, employment was down 2.0 percent, automotive declined 13.5 percent while other classified increased 5.1 percent. Classified revenues would have been 6.0 percent lower on a constant currency basis as real estate would have been 4.8 percent lower, employment would have declined 5.0 percent and automotive would have decreased 15.8 percent. Classified revenues were down 9.3 percent at our domestic community newspapers comprised of declines of 11.2 percent in real estate, 8.3 percent in employment and 15.8 percent in automotive revenues. For comparison purposes, real estate classified revenues were up 22.1 percent and employment classified revenues increased 7.4 percent in the first quarter of 2006 at our domestic community newspapers. Classified revenues in the UK, in pounds, were up 2.4 percent in the quarter as real estate and employment advanced 9.1 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively; automotive fell 15.8 percent while other classified increased 7.7 percent.
Pro forma national advertising revenues were 4.8 percent lower for the quarter. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were down 7.9. Paid advertising pages totaled 904 compared with 1,012 in the year-ago period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues were down 6.3 percent and television revenues were 6.9 percent lower reflecting primarily the absence of substantial ad demand related to the Olympics in the
(more)
first quarter of 2006. Captivate revenues were up 17 percent for the quarter. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the second quarter of 2007 would lag last year's second quarter in the very low single digits.
Other revenue in the quarter increased 12.0 percent due to higher commercial printing and PointRoll revenues.
