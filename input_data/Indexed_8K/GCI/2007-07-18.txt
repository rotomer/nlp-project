IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Gannett Co., Inc. Reports Second Quarter Results
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2007 second quarter earnings from operations per diluted share were $1.25 including income from discontinued operations of 1 cent per diluted share. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis were $1.24 for the second quarter compared to $1.28 in the second quarter of 2006.
"We achieved some positives in the quarter despite a very challenging advertising environment. Earnings growth was posted by Newsquest in the UK as the critical employment and real estate classified categories showed positive growth and we benefited from Newsquest's restructurings of the last few years. As well, the stronger exchange rate positively impacted results. Our domestic community newspapers, however, faced softening ad demand in part due to the real estate slowdown that has affected a number of our markets. Revenue from television station acquisitions in the broadcasting segment and positive results from Captivate helped offset substantially lower politically related ad demand in the quarter. The performance of our online initiatives and Internet investments and partnerships also were positives," said Craig A. Dubow, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
"There are a significant number of efforts going on at Gannett as we execute our strategic plan, continue our transformation and focus on potential opportunities. It is still early but we are convinced this is the right direction as we position Gannett for the future," he added.
During the quarter the company completed its sale of the Norwich (CT) Bulletin, the Rockford (IL) Register Star, the Observer-Dispatch in Utica, NY, and The Herald-Dispatch in Huntington, WV. In addition, the Chronicle-Tribune in Marion, IN, was contributed to the Gannett Foundation. Operating results for the second quarter and year-to-date exclude results from the former Gannett properties which have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations totaled $2.0 million in the quarter, or 1 cent per diluted share and $6.2 million or 3 cents per diluted share year-to-date. These transactions resulted in a second quarter after-tax gain of $73.8 million or 31 cents per diluted share which is also included in discontinued operations. Therefore, diluted earnings per share, including both the income and the gain from discontinued operations, were $1.56 for the quarter.
Reported results for the current quarter and year-to-date include KTVD-TV in Denver and WATL-TV in Atlanta which the company acquired in the third quarter of 2006.
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Total operating revenues for the company were $1.93 billion in the second quarter compared to $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2006 reflecting lower advertising demand at our domestic newspaper properties as well as the absence of politically related advertising demand that benefited the second quarter a year ago. Total operating revenues would have been 4.0 percent lower on a pro forma basis assuming

Gannett owned the same complement of properties in the second quarters of 2007 and 2006. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was $555.1 million. Net income was $289.9 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared with $304.5 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Reported operating expenses totaled $1.44 billion for the quarter, a 1.6 percent decline from $1.47 billion in the second quarter a year ago. The decline reflects continued cost control efforts and lower newsprint expense offset partially by the television station acquisitions, severance and accelerated depreciation expenses related to a number of efficiency efforts in the U.S. and the UK, and the higher exchange rate for the British pound. On a pro forma basis, total operating expenses were down 2.0 percent. Corporate expenses declined 8.1 percent to $18.7 million from $20.3 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter totaled 234,605,000 compared with 237,767,000 in 2006's second quarter. During the quarter, approximately 1.5 million shares were repurchased.
NEWSPAPERS
Newspaper segment operating revenues totaled $1.72 billion for the second quarter compared to $1.79 billion in the second quarter a year ago. Advertising revenues totaled $1.28 billion for the quarter, a decline of 5.3 percent. Local advertising revenues were 4.0 percent lower, national advertising revenues declined 2.8 percent and classified revenues were down 7.5 percent. Results for Newsquest, our operations in the UK, were better than our U.S. operations in the second quarter of 2007 versus the second quarter last year. In the UK, advertising revenues were down 2.5 percent on a constant currency basis while in the U.S. pro forma advertising revenues were 7.7 percent lower. Operating cash flow for the total newspaper segment, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, was $474.0 million in the second quarter.
Total newspaper operating expenses declined 2.0 percent for the quarter reflecting continuing expense control and efficiency efforts, and lower newsprint expense. On a pro forma, constant currency basis, newspaper segment operating expenses declined 3.3 percent. Reported newsprint expense fell 7.8 percent in the quarter. This reflects lower volume partially offset by slightly higher newsprint prices resulting from increased year-over-year prices in the UK and the higher exchange rate.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were down just over 1 percent in the quarter compared with the second quarter of 2006. However, in June we achieved higher ad revenues reflecting strong growth in a number of categories. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,034 compared with 1,098 in the year-ago quarter.
BROADCASTING
Broadcasting segment results for the quarter include WATL-TV (acquired in August 2006) and KTVD-TV (acquired in June 2006).
Broadcasting revenues (which include Captivate) were $204.7 million in the second quarter compared to $205.4 million in the second quarter of 2006, a 0.4 percent decline. The slight decline reflects revenue from the acquired television stations and revenue growth of 33.5 percent and 12.3 percent in

online and Captivate, respectively. This was offset by softness in television advertising demand and substantially lower politically related advertising versus the over $9 million achieved in the second quarter of 2006.  Broadcasting revenues would have been 6.5 percent lower if Gannett had owned the same group of stations in both the second quarter of 2007 and 2006. Reported broadcasting expenses increased 4.6 percent in the quarter. However, on a pro forma basis, broadcasting costs would have been 1.9 percent lower. In the second quarter operating cash flow was $95.9 million for the broadcasting segment.
Reported television revenues were $197.5 million in the second quarter compared to $199.0 million in the same quarter a year ago.
NON-OPERATING ITEMS
Interest expense was $66.4 million in the second quarter compared to $67.4 million in the second quarter of 2006 reflecting lower average debt balances. The increase in other non-operating income was due to solid results from our digital investments, gains on investments and the sale of real estate. During the quarter the company issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior convertible notes with a floating rate of interest equal to one-month LIBOR minus 23 basis points. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the company's outstanding commercial paper.
* * * *
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In June, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was 21.8 million unique visitors reaching 13.6 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracted 76.9 million monthly page impressions from approximately 5.1 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

News Release
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, July 18, 2007
Gannett Co., Inc. Releases June Statistical Report
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the sixth period ended July 1, 2007 declined 4.3 percent compared with the same period in 2006. For comparison purposes, the strengthening exchange rate of the British pound also affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have been down 5.5 percent.
June
Pro forma newspaper advertising revenues in June were 6.2 percent lower compared with the sixth period in 2006. Pro forma assumes all properties presently owned were owned in both periods. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising would have declined 7.5 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues declined 6.2 percent in June. In the U.S., across all products, all major categories except grocery and telecommunications lagged last year's results. On a constant currency basis, local advertising would have been down 7.0 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues were down 7.4 percent in the sixth period. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have been 9.5 percent lower. Real estate revenues were 11.5 percent lower, employment revenues were down 6.3 percent and automotive revenues declined 13.1 percent. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, the declines would have been 13.6 percent for real estate, 8.4 percent for employment and 14.7 percent for automotive. Classified results at Newsquest in the UK were significantly better than in the U.S. community newspapers. At our U.S. community newspapers, pro forma classified revenues were 14.0 percent lower for the sixth period reflecting declines of 22.4 percent in real estate revenues, 14.8 percent in employment revenues and 12.6 percent in automotive revenues. For comparison purposes, classified real estate revenues at our domestic community newspapers increased 18.6 percent for the sixth period in 2006. Classified revenues at our operations in the UK were down slightly, in pounds. Increases of 4.0 percent in employment, 2.0 percent in real estate and 4.1 percent in other classified revenues were offset by a 20.1 percent decline in automotive.
Pro forma national advertising revenues for the sixth period were down 2.2 percent. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were up 7.4 percent on paid ad pages of 329 versus 305 last year. In the sixth period at USA TODAY, there was strong growth in the technology, retail, home and building, packaged goods and pharmaceutical categories while the entertainment, automotive and financial categories lagged last year.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, were 5.8 percent lower for June. Over half of the decline reflected the absence of politically related ad demand that positively impacted
(more)
the sixth period a year ago. Television revenues were down 7.0 percent in the period as local revenues were 6.0 percent lower and national revenues declined 12.7 percent.
Other revenue increased 5.2 percent reflecting higher commercial printing revenues and strong revenue growth at PointRoll.
Second Quarter
For the second quarter of 2007, total pro forma operating revenues were down 4.0 percent and would have been 5.3 percent lower on a constant currency basis.
Pro forma newspaper advertising revenues for the quarter were 5.3 percent lower and would have been down 6.7 percent on a constant currency basis.
For the quarter, pro forma local advertising declined 4.0 percent and would have been 4.9 percent lower on a constant currency basis.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter declined 7.5 percent. Real estate revenues were 9.9 percent lower, employment was down 7.1 percent and automotive declined 13.6 percent. Classified revenues would have been 9.7 percent lower on a constant currency basis as real estate would have been down 12.2 percent; employment would have been 9.3 percent lower and automotive would have declined 15.4 percent. Classified revenues were 13.2 percent lower at our domestic community newspapers comprised of declines of 19.5 percent in real estate, 13.7 percent in employment and 14.1 percent in automotive revenues. For comparison purposes, classified real estate revenues for the second quarter a year ago were up 16.7 percent at our domestic community newspapers. Classified revenues in the UK, in pounds, were down 1.5 percent in the quarter as increases in real estate and employment of 3.1 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, were offset by a 19.2 percent decline in automotive.
Pro forma national advertising revenues were down 2.8 percent for the quarter. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were down 1.1 percent. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,034 compared with 1,098 in the year-ago period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues were 6.5 percent lower and television revenues declined 7.1 percent. The decline was due, in large part, to substantially lower political advertising that totaled $9.5 million in the second quarter last year. Captivate revenues were up 12.3 percent for the quarter. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the third quarter of 2007 would lag last year's third quarter in the low single digits. However, we generated over $19 million of political revenues in the third quarter of 2006.
Other revenue in the quarter increased 5.9 percent due primarily to higher revenues at PointRoll.
