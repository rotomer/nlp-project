Gannett Co., Inc. Reports Third Quarter Results
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2007 third quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.01 compared with $1.08 per share in the third quarter of 2006. In the quarter, the company took $14.5 million in severance expenses and facility consolidation costs related to a number of efficiency efforts in the UK and U.S.
Commenting on the third quarter results, Craig A. Dubow, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said: "Results for the quarter reflected an improved picture in the UK, digital growth, and our strong fiscal discipline. However, the company was also unfavorably impacted by the difficult advertising environment and the relative absence of political advertising.
"On the upside, operations in the UK showed steady improvement in the quarter. Online initiatives companywide also contributed positively to results. Broadcasting revenue, excluding the effect of significantly lower political advertising, grew in the quarter due in part to Captivate as well as to online growth. But our domestic publishing properties were hindered by the slowdown in real estate - particularly in Florida and the West where we have a considerable presence.
"We kept our usual tight rein on operating expenses throughout the quarter. During the quarter we had a significant level of severance expenses and consolidation costs related to efficiency efforts that will position us well for the remainder of the year and into 2008. Lower interest expense had a positive impact as well, as did the exchange rate."
As previously reported the company completed the divestiture of five of its newspaper properties in May of 2007. Operating results for the third quarter and year-to-date exclude results from these properties which have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations.
Reported results for the current quarter and year-to-date include KTVD-TV in Denver and WATL-TV in Atlanta which the company acquired in the third quarter of 2006.
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Total operating revenues for the company were $1.81 billion in the third quarter compared to $1.88 billion in the third quarter of 2006. The results reflect softer advertising demand at our domestic community newspapers mitigated in part by stronger results at Newsquest in the UK. The broadcasting segment benefited from solid non-political ad growth and revenue growth at Captivate and online; however, revenue was down overall due to significantly less political advertising compared to the third quarter of 2006. On a pro forma basis, assuming Gannett owned the same complement of properties in the third quarters of 2007 and 2006, total operating revenues would have been 4.0 percent lower.
(more)
Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization) was $473.1 million. Net income was $234.0 million in the third quarter compared to $256.2 million for the same period in 2006.
Reported operating expenses totaled $1.41 billion for the quarter, down 1.9 percent from the third quarter a year ago. The decline reflects continued cost control efforts and lower newsprint expense offset partially by the television station acquisitions, severance and accelerated depreciation expenses related to a number of efficiency efforts in the U.S. and the UK, and the higher exchange rate for the British pound. On a pro forma basis, total operating expenses were 2.1 percent lower. Corporate expenses totaled $17.8 million in the quarter, a decline of 8.2 percent from the $19.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2006.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter totaled 232,698,000 compared with 236,234,000 in 2006's third quarter. Approximately 1.1 million shares were repurchased during the quarter and 2.8 million shares year-to-date.
NEWSPAPERS
Newspaper segment operating revenues totaled $1.62 billion for the third quarter compared to $1.69 billion in the third quarter a year ago. Advertising revenues totaled $1.19 billion for the quarter, a 5.6 percent decline. Local advertising revenues were down 3.9 percent, national advertising revenues were 4.1 percent lower and classified revenues declined 7.7 percent. Results for our UK operations, Newsquest, were stronger than our U.S. operations. Advertising revenues at Newsquest were down less than one percent on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., pro forma advertising revenues were 8.4 percent lower. Operating cash flow in the third quarter for the total newspaper segment, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, was $407.1 million.
Total newspaper operating expenses were $1.27 billion for the quarter, a decline of $27.7 million or 2.1 percent reflecting ongoing efficiency efforts and lower newsprint expense mitigated by approximately $14.5 million in severance expenses and facility consolidation costs related to a number of efficiency efforts in the UK and U.S. Reported newsprint expense was 13.4 percent lower in the quarter compared to the third quarter a year ago driven by usage prices that were almost 4 percent lower and a decline in usage of over 10 percent.
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues decreased 6.6 percent compared with the third quarter of 2006. Paid advertising pages totaled 803 compared with 929 in the same period a year ago.
BROADCASTING
Broadcasting segment results for the quarter include WATL-TV (acquired in August 2006) and KTVD-TV (acquired in June 2006).
Broadcasting revenues (which include Captivate) were $189.5 million in the third quarter, a 3.4 percent decline from $196.2 million in the third quarter of 2006. The decline was due to substantially lower politically related advertising demand that totaled over $19 million in the third quarter of 2006. Excluding the impact of advertising demand associated with politics, net time sales revenue was 2.1 percent higher driven by growth in several categories, and better relative performance for automotive.
(more)
Revenue growth from online and Captivate of 37.6 percent and 17.7 percent, respectively, helped to partially offset the impact of lower political spending as well. Broadcasting revenues would have been down 5.1 percent if Gannett had owned the same group of stations in both the third quarter of 2007 and 2006.
Reported broadcasting expenses were 1.4 percent higher in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, however, broadcasting costs would have been almost 1 percent lower. In the third quarter operating cash flow for the broadcasting segment totaled $79.7 million.
Reported television revenues were $184.0 million in the third quarter compared to $191.5 million in the same quarter a year ago.
NON-OPERATING ITEMS
Interest expense was $63.0 million in the third quarter, a 16.0 percent decline compared to $75.0 million in the third quarter of 2006 due to lower average debt balances. The increase in other non-operating income was due to solid results from the company's digital business investments and higher income on financial investments.
* * * *
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In September, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was 21.0 million unique visitors reaching 13.4 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracted 76.5 million monthly page impressions from approximately 5.2 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, October 17, 2007
Gannett Co., Inc. Releases September Statistical Report
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the ninth period ended September 30, 2007 declined 4.0 percent compared with the same period in 2006. For comparison purposes, the strengthening exchange rate of the British pound also affected results for the company's UK operations. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma operating revenues would have been 5.1 percent lower.
September
Pro forma newspaper advertising revenues in September decreased 4.8 percent compared with the same period a year ago. Pro forma assumes all properties presently owned were owned in both periods. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, total pro forma newspaper advertising would have been down 6.1 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues were 4.3 percent lower in September. In the U.S., across all products, all major categories except telecommunications lagged last year's results. On a constant currency basis, local advertising would have declined 5.1 percent.
Pro forma classified revenues were down 5.6 percent in the ninth period. On a constant currency basis, pro forma classified revenues would have declined 7.8 percent. Real estate revenues were 7.1 percent lower, employment revenues declined 6.4 percent, automotive revenues were down 11.3 percent while other classified revenue increased 2.7 percent. If the exchange rate had remained constant year-over-year, the declines would have been 9.4 percent for real estate, 8.5 percent for employment and 13.0 percent for automotive. Classified results at Newsquest in the UK were much stronger than in the U.S. community newspapers. At our U.S. community newspapers, pro forma classified revenues were 12.6 percent lower in September reflecting declines of 20.2 percent in real estate revenues, 14.4 percent in employment revenues and 9.6 percent in automotive revenues. Classified revenues at our operations in the UK were 1.3 percent higher, in pounds. Increases of 8.7 percent in real estate, 2.1 percent in employment and 6.8 percent in other classified revenues were offset partially by a 20.9 percent decline in automotive.
Pro forma national advertising revenues for the ninth period were 3.8 percent lower. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were down 7.0 percent on paid ad pages of 292 versus 358 last year. In the ninth period at USA TODAY, growth in the travel, advocacy, home and building and credit card categories was offset by softness in the entertainment, technology, automotive, telecommunications and retail categories.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, were 8.9 percent lower. The decline was due to significantly lower advertising demand related to politics that had a positive impact on the same period in 2006. Excluding politically related advertising demand, net time sales revenue

increased 4.0 percent in the period. Television revenues were 9.8 percent lower in the period as local and national revenues declined 6.5 percent and 18.5 percent, respectively. Online revenues in broadcasting were 28.9 percent higher in the period while Captivate's revenues increased 21.0 percent.
Other revenue was up 3.4 percent driven primarily by solid revenue growth at PointRoll.
Third Quarter
For the third quarter of 2007, total pro forma operating revenues were 4.0 percent lower and would have been down 5.1 percent on a constant currency basis.
Pro forma newspaper advertising revenues for the quarter declined 5.6 percent and would have been 6.9 percent lower on a constant currency basis.
For the quarter, pro forma local advertising was down 3.9 percent and would have declined 4.7 percent on a constant currency basis.
Pro forma classified revenues were 7.7 percent lower for the quarter. Real estate revenues were down 11.0 percent, employment was 8.4 percent lower and automotive declined 11.7 percent. Classified revenues would have been 9.8 percent lower on a constant currency basis as real estate would have been down 13.2 percent; employment would have been 10.5 percent lower and automotive would have declined 13.4 percent. Classified revenues were down 13.7 percent at our domestic community newspapers comprised of declines of 21.8 percent in real estate, 14.8 percent in employment and 11.8 percent in automotive revenues. For comparison purposes, classified real estate revenues for the third quarter a year ago were 9.1 percent higher at our domestic community newspapers. Classified revenues in the UK, in pounds, were down less than one percent in the quarter. Increases in real estate and other classified revenues of 4.8 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, were offset by a slight decline in employment and 18.0 percent lower automotive revenues.
Pro forma national advertising revenues were 4.1 percent lower for the quarter. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were down 6.6 percent. Paid advertising pages totaled 803 compared with 929 in the year-ago period.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues were down 5.1 percent and television revenues declined 5.6 percent. The decline was due to substantially lower political advertising that totaled $19 million in the third quarter of last year. Net time sales revenue excluding political advertising was 2.1 percent higher in the quarter. Captivate revenues increased 17.7 percent for the quarter. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 would lag last year's fourth quarter in the mid teens. As a reminder, revenues related to political advertising were almost $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Other revenue in the quarter was 5.4 percent higher due in large part to higher revenues at PointRoll as well as commercial printing.
