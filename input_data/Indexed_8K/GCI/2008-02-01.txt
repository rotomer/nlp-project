FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Gannett Co., Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and 2007 Full-Year Results
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that 2007 fourth quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.06 compared with $1.47 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006, including the impact of a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge related to the value of mastheads of $50.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Excluding this charge, earnings per share from continuing operations would have been $1.28. The results for the quarter also include approximately $38 million in pre-tax severance expenses and facility consolidation costs related to a number of efficiency efforts in the U.S. and the UK.
"Gannett completed 2007 with strong forward momentum on implementing our strategic plan. That is an impressive accomplishment given the back drop of cyclical pressures on advertising, a softer economic environment and secular changes in the industry," said Craig Dubow, chairman, president and CEO of Gannett.
"In the fourth quarter, we faced a challenging advertising environment, tough comparisons, which included an extra week in 2006, and the relative absence of election-related advertising in broadcasting. Our effort to align expenses with revenue opportunities will better position us for the future although it resulted in significant severance expenses and consolidation costs in the quarter. Our online revenue growth contributed to our results for the quarter. Lower newsprint costs and interest expense, and the exchange rate also had a positive impact." he added.
The company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 as of December 30, 2007. Due to the current business environment and expected operating results for some recent acquisitions in the U.S. and in the UK, the company incurred a $72.0 million pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge to reduce the value of certain mastheads. "This non-cash accounting charge does not impact our operations or operating cash flow," Dubow said.
Gannett's fiscal year included 52 weeks compared with 53 weeks in 2006. The fourth quarter was comprised of 13 weeks compared with 14 weeks in the same quarter of 2006. All of the company's results detailed below were impacted by the extra week in 2006.
As previously reported, the company completed the divestiture of five of its newspaper properties in May of 2007. Operating results for the year exclude results from these properties which have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations.
Reported results for the quarter and the year include KTVD-TV in Denver and WATL-TV in Atlanta which the company acquired during the third quarter of 2006.

CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Total operating revenues for the company were $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $2.2 billion in the 14-week fourth quarter of 2006, an 11.9 percent decline. The decline is due to lower newspaper advertising resulting from cyclical pressures in our markets, significantly lower politically related advertising demand that positively impacted results last year and the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding the extra week, total operating revenues would have been 7.2 percent lower. Operating cash flow (defined as operating income plus depreciation, amortization and the non-cash charge) was $554.0 million. Net income was $245.3 million in the quarter.
Reported operating expenses were 7.1 percent lower and totaled $1.5 billion for the quarter reflecting lower newsprint expense, continued cost containment efforts and the absence of the extra week in 2006. Expense reductions were partially offset by severance and accelerated depreciation expenses related to a number of efficiency efforts in the UK and U.S. and the higher exchange rate for the British pound. Operating expenses would have declined 11.6 percent excluding the non-cash charge. Corporate expenses declined 17.8 percent to $17.9 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2006.
For the year, total operating revenues were $7.4 billion compared to $7.8 billion in 2006, a 5.2 percent decline. On a comparable week basis, pro forma operating revenues would have been down 4.2 percent reflecting the relative absence of approximately $112 million of Olympic and politically related ad revenues and a more challenging advertising environment. Operating expenses were $5.8 billion, down 2.6 percent from the prior year. Excluding the non-cash impairment charge, operating expenses would have been 3.8 percent lower. Expense reductions for the full year were tempered by severance and accelerated depreciation costs of approximately $65 million related to our efficiency efforts. Operating cash flow totaled $2.0 billion and net income was $975.6 million for the year.
Average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter totaled 231,877,000 compared with 234,790,000 in 2006's fourth quarter. Average diluted shares outstanding for all of 2007 were 233,740,000 versus 236,756,000 in 2006. Shares repurchased totaled approximately 2.0 million in the fourth quarter and 4.8 million year-to-date.
NEWSPAPERS
Newspaper segment operating revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter. Advertising revenues totaled $1.2 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter a year ago. Pro forma advertising revenues excluding the extra week would have declined 7.7 percent. On the same basis, local advertising revenues would have been 3.3 percent lower, national ad revenues would have declined 11.6 percent and classified revenues would have been down 11.4 percent. Advertising revenues at our domestic newspaper properties would have been 9.3 percent lower on a comparable week basis. At Newsquest in the UK, advertising revenues on a constant currency basis were 6.5 percent lower excluding the extra week in 2006. Operating cash flow for the total newspaper segment, which includes USA TODAY and our UK properties, was $468.2 million in the fourth quarter.
Total newspaper operating expenses were 6.5 percent lower for the quarter reflecting lower newsprint expense, cost control and the extra week in last year's quarter partially offset by approximately $38 million in severance and facility consolidation costs and the non-cash charge. Newspaper operating expenses would have been 11.5 percent lower excluding the impairment charge. Reported newsprint expense declined 25.3 percent for the quarter due to usage prices that were 8 percent lower and almost 19 percent lower volume, reflecting generally reduced consumption and the effect of the extra week in 2006.
(more)
At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 16.7 percent lower in the fourth quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago due in part to the extra week in 2006. On a comparable week basis USA TODAY's advertising revenues would have been down 12.7 percent. Paid advertising pages totaled 1,045 compared with 1,348 in the year-ago quarter and 1,285 based on a 13-week quarter in 2006.
BROADCASTING
Broadcasting segment results for the quarter and year include WATL-TV (acquired in August 2006) and KTVD-TV (acquired in June 2006).
Broadcasting revenues (which include Captivate) totaled $212.0 million for the quarter, a 21.7 percent decline due primarily to the relative lack of politically related ad demand that totaled almost $58 million last year as well as the extra week in the fourth quarter in 2006. Broadcasting revenues excluding the extra week would have been 18.0 percent lower. Online revenues were 18.0 percent higher in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. The growth rate of online revenue was tempered by the absence of the extra week in the quarter. Reported broadcasting expenses were 11.3 percent lower. Operating cash flow was $99.9 million.
Revenues for television operations were $202.2 million for the quarter. Reported television expenses totaled $113.0 million compared to $128.5 million for the same period a year ago, a 12.1 percent decline.
NON-OPERATING ITEMS
Beginning with this report, the company's equity share of operating results from its newspaper partnerships, including Tucson, which participates in a joint operating agency, the California Newspapers Partnership and the Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership, have been reclassified from "Other" revenue and are now reflected as "Equity income in unconsolidated investees, net" in the non-operating section of the Consolidated Statements of Income. This line also includes equity income and losses from online/new technology businesses which were previously classified in "Other" non-operating items. "Other" revenue is now comprised principally of commercial printing revenues and revenue from PointRoll.
All prior periods presented reflect these reclassifications. A schedule detailing the impact of the reclassifications for the last two years on a quarterly basis has been included in the press release.
The decline in equity income in unconsolidated investees for the fourth quarter in 2007 reflects lower newspaper partnership earnings and operating results from a new Internet partnership.
Interest expense for the fourth quarter was $57.5 million, a 29.0 percent decline compared to $80.9 million for the year-ago quarter. The decline was due to lower average balances and lower interest rates.
Other non-operating income was $2.7 million for the quarter compared to $10.9 million in the same quarter a year ago due primarily to the absence of gains on the sale of some Internet investments in the fourth quarter of 2006.
* * * *
At the end of the quarter, Gannett had more than 100 domestic publishing Web sites, including USATODAY.com, one of the most popular newspaper sites on the Web. The company also had Web sites in all of its 19 television markets. In December, Gannett's consolidated domestic Internet audience share was 23.9 million unique visitors reaching 14.5 percent of the Internet audience according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Newsquest is also an Internet leader in the UK where its network of Web sites attracted more than 62 million monthly page impressions from approximately 4.8 million unique users.
All references in this release to "comparable" revenue results and "operating cash flow" are to non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that this use allows management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's results in a more meaningful and consistent manner. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating cash flow amounts to the Company's consolidated statements of income is attached.

In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principlesgenerally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") included in this pressrelease, the company has provided information regarding diluted earningsper share ("EPS") from continuing operations excluding the impairmentcharge.  Management believes EPS excluding the impairment charge betterreflects the ongoing performance of the company and enables managementand investors to meaningfully trend, analyze and benchmark the performanceof the company's operations.  This measure is also more comparable tofinancial measures reported by our competitors.  EPS excluding theimpairment charge should not be considered a substitute for EPS calculatedin accordance with GAAP.
The table below reconciles earnings per share in accordance with GAAP toearnings per share excluding the impairment charge:

News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Friday, February 1, 2008
Gannett Co., Inc. Releases December Statistical Report
McLEAN, VA - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) reported today that total pro forma operating revenues for the twelfth period ended December 30, 2007, declined 24.1 percent. The twelfth period in 2007 spanned the usual four weeks compared to five weeks for the twelfth period in 2006. Therefore, comparisons are not fully representative of current trends. A schedule summarizing revenue trends excluding the extra week in 2006 has been included with this release. Total pro forma operating revenues would have been 10.8 percent lower excluding the extra week in period twelve in 2006. Pro forma assumes that all properties presently owned were owned in both periods.
December
Newspaper advertising revenues in December were 26.4 percent lower compared with the same period in 2006. Excluding the extra week in the twelfth period in 2006, pro forma advertising revenues would have declined 14.5 percent.
Pro forma local advertising revenues were down 23.7 percent in the period but would have been 9.8 percent lower excluding the fifth week in 2006.
Pro forma classified revenues declined 28.6 percent in the twelfth period. Pro forma classified revenues would have been 17.4 percent lower on a four-week to four-week comparison. On the same basis, classified revenues at our domestic newspaper properties would have declined 16.8 percent.
Pro forma national advertising revenues in December were down 29.8 percent and would have declined 21.7 percent excluding the extra week. At USA TODAY, advertising revenues were 28.4 percent lower on ad pages of 312 versus 476 last year on a four week comparison basis. For the twelfth period excluding the extra week in 2006, at USA TODAY, strong growth in the packaged goods and credit card categories was offset by weakness in other major categories.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues, which include Captivate, declined 21.7 percent in the twelfth period. Excluding the fifth week, broadcast revenues and television revenues would have been 6.5 percent lower.
Other revenue, on a comparable week basis, increased 3.1 percent in December.
Beginning with this report, the company's equity share of operating results from its newspaper partnerships, including Tucson, which participates in a joint operating agency, the California Newspapers Partnership and Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnership have been reclassified from "Other revenue". It is now reflected in a separate line in the Non-operating section of the Consolidated Statement of Income titled "Equity income in unconsolidated investees, net". Reclassifications have been made for all periods presented. Other revenue is now comprised principally of commercial printing revenues and revenue from PointRoll.

Fourth Quarter
For the fourth quarter of 2007, total pro forma operating revenues were 11.9 percent lower. The fourth quarter was comprised of 13 weeks in 2007 compared to 14 weeks in 2006. Excluding the extra week in 2006's fourth quarter, pro forma operating revenues would have declined 7.2 percent.
Newspaper advertising revenues, on a pro forma basis, for the fourth quarter were down 12.2 percent and excluding the extra week would have been 7.7 percent lower. Domestic newspaper advertising declined 14.1 percent and on a comparable week basis would have been down 9.3 percent.
For the fourth quarter, pro forma local advertising was down 9.0 percent but would have been 3.3 percent lower excluding the extra week.
Pro forma classified revenues for the quarter declined 16.1 percent and excluding the extra week would have been 11.4 percent lower.
Pro forma national advertising was 12.9 percent lower for the fourth quarter. National advertising would have declined 11.6 percent, excluding the extra week. At USA TODAY advertising revenues were 12.7 percent lower in the quarter while paid advertising pages totaled 1,045 versus 1,285 in the fourth quarter of 2006 on a comparable week basis. On the same basis at USA TODAY, the financial, advocacy and packaged goods categories grew significantly while all other major categories lagged last year's results.
Pro forma broadcasting revenues for the quarter were down 21.7 percent and would have been 18.0 percent lower excluding the extra week. Television revenues were 18.8 percent lower on a comparable week basis reflecting primarily the relative absence of advertising demand associated with politics that totaled almost $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Based on current pacings, television revenues for the first quarter of 2008 would lag last year's first quarter in the mid-single digits.
Other revenue in the quarter, excluding the extra week in 2006, was 5.3 percent higher.
In addition to the revenue and statistical summary, attached is a chart which shows the consolidated Gannett Online audience share for December from Nielsen//Net Ratings. In December, Gannett's domestic Websites had approximately 23.9 million unique visitors reaching 14.5 percent of the Internet audience.

In addition, the Chronicle-Tribune in Marion, IN, was contributed to the Gannett Foundation on May 21, 2007. The revenue and statistical data related to these properties has been excluded from all periods presented.
The pro forma broadcasting revenue statistics include results for KTVD-TV in Denver (acquired in late June 2006 and operated as a duopoly with KUSA-TV) and WATL-TV in Atlanta (acquired in August 2006 and operated as a duopoly with WXIA-TV). Ad linage for Newsquest,
