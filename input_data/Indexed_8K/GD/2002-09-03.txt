General Dynamics receives payment demand in A-12 case Demand jumps the gun on settlement talks and appellate litigation
On August 30, 2002, the Department of the Navy notified General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) and the Boeing Company that unless they paid, within 30 days, approximately $2.3 billion that the government says the companies owe in the A-12 aircraft case, it would turn the matter over to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for collection. The letter acknowledged that negotiations regarding a settlement of the A-12 matter are ongoing.
FALLS CHURCH, Va.
General Dynamics regards this demand as an unseemly negotiating tactic, and an apparent effort to gain advantage during settlement talks. In the event the negotiations do not result in settlement in the 30-day timeframe, the company will seek to stay the collection effort before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The government's entitlement to any payment at all in the A-12 matter is already central to the issues to be heard by the appellate court.
A copy of the Navy's August 30 letter is available on General Dynamics' website at http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press_releases/2002/Navy_A-12_Letter.pdf.
