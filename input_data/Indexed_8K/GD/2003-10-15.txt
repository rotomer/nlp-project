General Dynamics Third Quarter
Revenues Increase 35 Percent
General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported 2003 third quarter revenues of $4.4 billion, a 35 percent increase over 2002 third quarter revenues of $3.3 billion. Net earnings in the 2003 third quarter were $262 million, or $1.32 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared with 2002 third quarter net earnings of $268 million, or $1.32 per share fully diluted. The quarter ended September 28.
FALLS CHURCH, Va. 
Sales for the first nine months of 2003 were $11.8 billion, compared with $9.9 billion for the first nine months of 2002, an increase of 19 percent. Net earnings for the first nine months of 2003 were $725 million, or $3.64 per share on a fully diluted basis. Net earnings in the same period for 2002 were $760 million, or $3.74 per share fully diluted.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $368 million in the quarter and $826 million year-to-date. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $320 million in the quarter and $711 million for the first nine months of 2003.
Funded backlog at the 2003 nine-month point is $24.3 billion, and total backlog is $38.7 billion, compared with $21.6 billion and $29.5 billion, respectively, at this point last year.
 
"In the quarter, we experienced significant organic sales growth, respectable earnings performance, very strong cash generation and strong order intake resulting in a significant backlog increase," said Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics chairman and CEO.
"Earnings were impacted negatively by a significant charge in our Marine Systems group for commercial shipbuilding at NASSCO that was essentially offset by a favorable tax event in the quarter," said Chabraja.
"The Information Systems and Technology segment continues to perform well with good sales and earnings growth. As expected, the acquisition of Veridian Corporation was completed in the third quarter, and it is quickly being integrated," said Chabraja. "Another important addition, Digital System Resources was also completed in this period, expanding our depth in support of intelligence customers."
"Gulfstream's operating earnings continued the sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement they have been generating through this year, overcoming continuing, albeit diminishing, charges on pre-owned aircraft sales and restructuring costs. Gulfstream continued to improve operations by taking cost out of the business, reducing its inventory of pre-owned aircraft available for sale, and experiencing price stabilization in both pre-owned and new aircraft sales activity," Chabraja said.
"The Combat Systems group also experienced strong sales and earnings growth. The acquisition of Intercontinental Manufacturing (IMCO) closed in the quarter, broadening our participation in the production of aviation munitions. In addition to the positive effect of adding IMCO, the Combat Systems group benefited significantly from the continued integration of GM Defense, and from increased activity at Santa Barbara Sistemas related to the Leopard tank program," said Chabraja.
"In addition, the Marine Systems group received the largest single order for submarines ever placed by the United States Navy, boosting its total backlog to $18.6 billion. This gives the group additional opportunities to enhance performance into the next decade," he said.
