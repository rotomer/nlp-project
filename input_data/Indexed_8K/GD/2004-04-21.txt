Exhibit 99.1
General Dynamics Posts Strong First Quarter
General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported 2004 first quarter revenues of $4.8 billion, as compared with 2003 first quarter revenues of $3.4 billion. Net earnings in the 2004 first quarter were $269 million, or $1.34 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared with 2003 first quarter net earnings of $221 million, or $1.11 per share fully diluted. Net cash provided by operating activities was $329 million for the quarter. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $276 million.
FALLS CHURCH, Va. 
Funded backlog at the end of the first quarter was $27 billion, and total backlog was $41.6 billion, compared with $23.9 billion and $30.5 billion, respectively, at the end of the first quarter of 2003. Further, funded backlog increased nearly seven percent, or $1.8 billion, over fourth quarter 2003.
"This is a very strong start to 2004," said Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics chairman and CEO. "The quarter is a clear demonstration of the effectiveness of our focus on program performance. Our business aviation and marine groups both improved margin performance over the year-ago period and quarter-over-quarter. In addition, Information Systems and Technology and Combat Systems provided healthy margins on materially increased volume, evidencing the successful integration of the GM Defense and Veridian acquisitions," Chabraja said.
 
"The increase in funded backlog over year-end was largely attributable to a $580 million U.S. Navy contract to build the fifth and sixth T-AKE dry-cargo ships; the order for Stryker vehicles for the fourth U.S. Army Brigade Combat Team; and several orders in the Information Systems and Technology group related to onboard computing systems, intelligence systems support and network infrastructure modernization around the world," Chabraja said. "At Gulfstream, order activity was sufficient to keep funded backlog relatively constant."
"On the strength of this quarter's performance, we are raising our guidance for 2004 diluted earnings per share to the range of $5.70 to $5.75," Chabraja concluded.
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, employs approximately 68,400 people worldwide and had 2003 revenue of $16.6 billion. The company is a market leader in mission-critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation.
