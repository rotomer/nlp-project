General Dynamics Reports Continued Strength in Third Quarter
,  General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported $4.8 billion in revenues for the third quarter of 2004, compared to 2003 third-quarter revenues of $4.4 billion. Net earnings were $322 million in the quarter, or $1.60 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared with 2003 third-quarter net earnings of $262 million, or $1.32 per share fully diluted. Net cash provided by operating activities was $309 million for the quarter. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $249 million.

Funded backlog at the end of the third quarter was $25.3 billion, and total backlog was $40.3 billion, compared with $26.4 billion and $41.1 billion, respectively, at the end of the second quarter of 2004.
"General Dynamics generated strong results for the quarter in both absolute and relative terms," said Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics chairman and chief executive officer. "Operating earnings increased over the year-ago period in all of our segments. Further, our operating earnings rate improved this quarter as it has in each of the last four quarters. In the Aerospace group, earnings more than doubled over the third quarter of 2003, based on improving market conditions, continuing cost improvement and tighter control of pre-owned activity. Combat Systems improved margins on a modest increase in revenue, and the Information Systems and Technology group continued to generate positive returns. Compared to the same period last year, Marine Systems also improved. However, the group's margin rate declined relative to earlier quarters this year as a result of cost growth in our commercial tanker program during the period," Chabraja said.
"Our backlog  both funded and unfunded  remained strong, and net cash continues to approximate net earnings," Chabraja said.
