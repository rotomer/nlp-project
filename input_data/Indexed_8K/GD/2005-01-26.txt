, Va.  General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported 2004 fourth quarter net earnings of $336 million, or $1.66 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to 2003 fourth quarter net earnings of $279 million, or $1.40 per share fully diluted. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $5.2 billion, compared to fourth quarter 2003 revenue of $4.7 billion.
FALLS CHURCH
 
Revenue for the full year of 2004 was $19.2 billion, compared with $16.4 billion for 2003, an increase of 17 percent. Net earnings for 2004 were $1.23 billion, or $6.09 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared with net earnings of $1 billion, or $5.04 fully diluted in 2003, an increase of 22 percent.
 
During 2004 the company announced plans to divest several businesses. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the company's reported $19.2 billion in 2004 sales excludes $375 million in revenue associated with these businesses. The income from these businesses ($0.12 per share for the year) is included, but reported as discontinued operations on the company's earnings statement for both the quarter and the year.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $799 million in the quarter and $1.8 billion for the year. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $709 million in the quarter and $1.54 billion for the year. Free cash flow from operations for the year-ago period was $789 million in the quarter and $1.5 billion for the year.
 
Funded backlog at the end of 2004 was $28.3 billion, and total backlog was $42.1 billion, compared to $25.1 billion and $39.9 billion, respectively, at the end of the third quarter 2004.
 
 
"General Dynamics generated solid returns again this quarter," said General Dynamics Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas D. Chabraja. "Net earnings grew more than 20 percent over fourth quarter 2003, on revenue growth of approximately 10 percent. In addition, we had another outstanding cash performance in the quarter," Chabraja said.
 
"In the Aerospace group, Gulfstream had tremendous order activity in the fourth quarter, resulting in a $586 million increase to its funded backlog. Several key program wins in Information Systems and Technology resulted in an increase of nearly $1 billion in its funded backlog; and Combat Systems' funded backlog increased by approximately $200 million, not including the impact of a 260-vehicle order from Portugal that remains to be finalized with our European Land Combat Systems group," said Chabraja.
 
"Additional awards since the end of the year further strengthened our backlog, including a $586 million contract for two T-AKE combat logistics ships received by NASSCO, and a $562 million award for the second of two DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers that are in the Defense Department's FY2005 budget," he said.
 
"In three out of four of our major business groups, earnings and operating margins increased dramatically over the year-ago period, and the growth of funded backlog in all four groups bodes well for our future.
 
"Looking forward in 2005, we anticipate continued solid performance from Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology, margin improvement in Marine Systems and continued improvement at Gulfstream," Chabraja said. "We expect 2005 earnings per share from continuing operations to increase in a range between 11 and 13 percent. We also expect free cash flow from operations to approximate net earnings."
