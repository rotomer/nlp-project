General Dynamics Reports Strong Earnings, Cash and
Backlog Growth for First Quarter 2005
 
 
, Va.  General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported 2005 first quarter revenues of $4.8 billion, compared to 2004 first quarter revenues of $4.6 billion. Net earnings in the 2005 first quarter were $336 million, or $1.66 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared with 2004 first quarter net earnings of $269 million, or $1.34 per share fully diluted.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $358 million for the quarter. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $317 million.
 
Funded backlog at the end of the first quarter was $30.7 billion, and total backlog was $44.9 billion, compared to $28.2 billion and $42 billion, respectively, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2004. Backlog increased in each of the four business segments.
 
Net earnings for the quarter included a one-time tax benefit resulting from the resolution of the 1999-2002 Federal audit cycle. This resulted in a tax provision of $ 69 million, which is $63 million less than the $132 million provision for taxes in the first quarter of 2004.
 
"General Dynamics is off to a good start for 2005," said Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics chairman and chief executive officer. "Three of our four primary business groups demonstrated solid performance in the quarter, and we had good margin improvement in Aerospace and Information Systems and Technology. If there was a disappointment, it was that we had to take an additional charge against the commercial tanker program at NASSCO; however, we delivered the second ship of four this quarter."
 
 
 
 
 
"Total backlog increased $2.9 billion in the first quarter, with $2.5 billion of that in the funded backlog account," Chabraja continued.
 
"Net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings in the quarter, and free cash flow from operations nearly equaled net earnings," Chabraja said. "Our focus on performance at all levels of the business continues to generate positive results."
 
"We are increasing our guidance for 2005 earnings per share from continuing operations to $6.95 per share, approximately 16 percent above the $5.97 earnings per share recorded for continuing operations in 2004," Chabraja said.
 
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, employs approximately 70,100 people worldwide. The company is a market leader in mission-critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation.
