Item 8.01 Other Events
 
On September 6, 2005, the jury in rendered a verdict against the company in the amount of $138 million and a verdict in its favor in the amount of $8 million on the company's counterclaims. The judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, in which the case is pending, has not entered judgment on the jury's verdict, but rather has asked for post-trial motions and briefs from both parties to be filed over the next 150 days.
Final Analysis Communication Services, Inc. (FACS) v. General Dynamics Corporation, et. al.
 
The case grows out of a suit filed in May 2003 and amended in October 2004 by FACS, alleging the company breached contracts among the company, FACS and FACS' then-corporate parent, Final Analysis, Inc. (FAI), a Maryland corporation. FAI is currently a debtor in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland.
 
General Dynamics believes the jury's verdict is not supported by the evidence presented and is legally flawed. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
