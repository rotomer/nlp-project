General Dynamics Reports Strong Third-Quarter
Financial Results
 
 
, Va.  General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported 2005 third-quarter revenues of $5.4 billion, a 16 percent increase over third-quarter 2004 revenues of $4.6 billion. Operating earnings increased in the quarter to $588 million, compared to $493 million in third-quarter 2004. Net earnings were $374 million, or $1.84 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to net earnings of $322 million, or $1.60 per share fully diluted, for the year-ago period.

Cash flow was very strong with net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter at $600 million, while free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $527 million. Year-to-date, net cash from operating activities climbed to $1.2 billion and free cash flow from operations was nearly $1 billion, $168 million more than was generated in the same nine-month period last year.
 
Company-wide, total orders in the third quarter were $5.1 billion. Funded backlog at the end of the third quarter was $29.3 billion, and total backlog was $43.4 billion, compared to $25.1 billion and $39.8 billion, respectively, at the end of the third quarter of 2004.
 
"This was a very strong quarter for General Dynamics," said company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas D. Chabraja. "Revenue, operating earnings and margin rates increased substantially in three of the company's four major business segments and, despite a charge in the Marine Systems group's commercial shipbuilding program, net earnings grew a healthy 16 percent overall.
 
 
 
"We're very pleased with the level of cash generated by operating activities and free cash flow for the quarter, which puts us ahead of our cash plan for the year," Chabraja continued.
 
"While the company's total backlog remained essentially the same when compared to the second quarter of this year, Information Systems and Technology's total backlog grew by $800 million in the quarter and is $2.5 billion higher than at this time last year. In the Aerospace sector, despite increased deliveries in the third quarter, funded backlog grew by nearly $180 million from just 90 days ago.
 
"Our focus on performance continues to generate positive results on behalf of shareholders," Chabraja said.
 
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, employs approximately 71,900 people worldwide. The company is a market leader in mission-critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation.
