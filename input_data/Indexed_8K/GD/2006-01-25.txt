General Dynamics Reports Strong Fourth-Quarter Results
 
 
 
, Va.  General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported 2005 fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $406 million, or $2.00 per share on a fully diluted basis; comparable 2004 fourth-quarter earnings were $330 million, or $1.63 per share fully diluted. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $5.8 billion, compared to fourth-quarter 2004 revenue of $5.2 billion.
FALLS CHURCH
 
Revenue for the full year of 2005 was $21.2 billion, compared with $19.1 billion for 2004, an increase of 11 percent. Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 grew by 22 percent to $1.47 billion, or $7.25 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared with net earnings of $1.21 billion, or $5.98 fully diluted, in 2004.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $900 million in the quarter and $2.06 billion for the year. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $788 million in the quarter and $1.78 billion for the year.
 
"General Dynamics generated solid returns in the fourth quarter of 2005, capping another very strong year," said General Dynamics Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas D. Chabraja. "Revenue and earnings grew substantially over the fourth quarter of 2004, and full-year earnings per share from continuing operations grew by 21 percent over 2004, on a revenue increase of 11 percent," Chabraja said.
 
 
"Free cash flow from operations in the year of approximately $1.8 billion once again represents a very efficient conversion of net earnings into cash, a ratio of 122 percent," said Chabraja. "Backlog year-over-year remained strong, growing by approximately $400 million; especially notable is the $1.2 billion increase in the Aerospace backlog from year-end 2004 to year-end 2005."
 
"Highlights of the fourth quarter include revenue increases in each of the company's four major business groups. Combat Systems sales grew by 23 percent over the fourth quarter of 2004, on strong demand for ground vehicles and associated systems around the world. Revenue in Information Systems and Technology was up 12 percent, largely attributable to the strength of the tactical communications and computing markets, and production and support for intelligence systems. In Aerospace, Gulfstream increased revenue by 13 percent over fourth quarter 2004, and received net orders for 44 aircraft," said Chabraja.
 
"Looking forward in 2006, we anticipate continued solid performance from Combat Systems, Information Systems and Technology and the Aerospace group, as well as margin improvement in Marine Systems," Chabraja said. "We expect 2006 earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $7.80 and $7.85 per share including the effect of expensing options. We also expect free cash flow from operations to approximate net earnings."
