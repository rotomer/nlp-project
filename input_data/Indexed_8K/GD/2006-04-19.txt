General Dynamics Reports Strong Earnings, Cash and Sales Growth for First Quarter 2006
 
, Va.  General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported 2006 first-quarter revenues of $5.6 billion, reflecting a 16 percent increase over 2005 first-quarter revenues of $4.8 billion. Net earnings in the 2006 first quarter were $374 million, or $0.92 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to first-quarter 2005 net earnings of $336 million, or $0.83 per share fully diluted, a per-share increase of 10.8 percent.

FALLS CHURCH
Net cash provided by operating activities was $465 million for the quarter. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $406 million.
"General Dynamics delivered another strong performance in the first quarter of 2006," said Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics chairman and chief executive officer. "Revenues and operating earnings increased significantly over the first quarter of 2005, reflecting growth in each of the company's four major business groups. Margins were strong in all segments, with three of the four groups exhibiting healthy increases.
"Net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow from operations exceeded net earnings in the quarter," Chabraja said.
"The company sustained its strong backlog of almost $42 billion. In addition, nearly $2 billion in combat-vehicle contract awards by European customers were announced during the quarter that are not yet reflected in the backlog, and subsequent to the quarter's end, a $464 million order was received for 306 Stryker wheeled combat vehicles for the U.S. Army's brigade combat teams.
"Our focus on performance at all levels of the business continues to generate positive results," Chabraja said.
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, employs approximately 72,700 people worldwide. The company is a market leader in mission-critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation.
