Item 8.01 Other Events
In May 2003, Final Analysis Communication Services, Inc. (FACS), served the company with a complaint it filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (the Court). In October 2004, FACS filed an amended complaint alleging that the company breached contracts among the company, FACS and FACS' then-corporate parent, Final Analysis, Inc. (FAI), a Maryland corporation.
As previously reported, on September 6, 2005, the jury in rendered a verdict against the company in the amount of $138 million and a verdict in its favor in the amount of $8 million on the company's counterclaims. The judge did not enter judgment on the jury's verdict, but rather asked for post-trial motions and briefs from both parties. These motions and briefs were filed, and oral argument before the judge was held on April 10, 2006.
Final Analysis Communication Services, Inc. v. General Dynamics Corporation, et. al.
On April 17, 2006, the Court, notwithstanding the jury's verdict, entered a Final Order of Judgment in the company's favor with respect to $118 million of the jury's verdict, thus reducing the jury's verdict against the company to $20 million. The Court also upheld the $8 million jury verdict in the company's favor.
It is expected that the Court's Order will be appealed. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
