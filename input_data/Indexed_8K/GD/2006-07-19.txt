General Dynamics Reports Strong Sales, Earnings in Second Quarter 2006
 
 General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported 2006 second-quarter revenues of $5.9 billion, a 15.5 percent increase over second-quarter 2005 revenues of $5.1 billion. Earnings from continuing operations in the quarter increased to $420 million, or $1.03 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to 2005 second-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $338 million, or $0.83 per share fully diluted. (All per-share data has been adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split that occurred March 24, 2006.)
FALLS CHURCH, Va.
General Dynamics also reported $216 million in earnings from discontinued operations, which include a gain on the sale of certain non-core assets. Net earnings, including discontinued operations, were $636 million for second-quarter 2006, or $1.56 per share on a fully diluted basis. In comparison, net earnings for the second quarter of 2005 were $345 million, or $0.85 per share fully diluted.
Funded backlog at the end of the second quarter was $30.5 billion, and total backlog was $42.4 billion, compared to $29.2 billion and $41.6 billion, respectively, at the end of the first quarter of 2006.
For the first half of 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was $793 million, while free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $664 million.
The company's second-quarter 2006 results were driven largely by sales growth in the Aerospace and Combat Systems groups, and operating earnings growth in Aerospace, Combat Systems and Marine Systems. Information Systems and Technology, Combat Systems and Aerospace generated strong orders as well, increasing their backlog significantly in the quarter.
"General Dynamics once again has delivered strong results," said Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics chairman and chief executive officer. "Sales and operating earnings increased in all four business segments compared to the year-ago period, year-to-date cash generation continues to meet our expectations and funded backlog grew by $1.3 billion quarter-over-quarter.
"We now expect 2006 earnings from continuing operations to be approximately $4.15 per share, fully diluted," Chabraja said.
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Va., employs approximately 81,900 people worldwide. The company is a market leader in mission-critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation.
