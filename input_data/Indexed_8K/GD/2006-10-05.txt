The Inspector of Votes may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the Inspector of Votes in the performance of its duties. The Inspector of Votes need not be a stockholder of the Corporation, and any officer or director may be an Inspector of Votes on any question other than a vote for or against such officer's or director's election to any position with the Corporation or any other question in which such officer or director may be directly interested.

Proxies
SECTION 1. . (a) Shares of any or all of the Corporation's classes or series of stock may be evidenced by certificates for shares of stock, in such form as the Board shall prescribe, or may be issued in uncertificated form. The issuance of shares in uncertificated form shall not affect shares already represented by a certificate until the certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Except as expressly provided by law, there shall be no differences in the rights and obligations of stockholders based on whether their shares are represented by certificates or are in uncertificated form.
Certificates for Stock and Uncertificated Shares
(b) Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated shares, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on a certificate pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or, with respect to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
(c) Every holder of stock in the Corporation represented by certificates, and upon request any holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate, in such form as the Board shall prescribe, certifying the number and class of shares of stock of the Corporation owned by such holder. Each such certificate shall be signed in the name of the Corporation by
 
the Chairman of the Board, the President or a Vice President and the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer clerk, transfer agent or registrar who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature shall have been placed upon, any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer, transfer clerk, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate or certificates shall have been issued by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as though such individual was an officer, transfer clerk, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
SECTION 2. . Transfer of shares of stock of the Corporation shall be made only on the stock records of the Corporation by the holder of record thereof or by his attorney thereunto authorized by the power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation or the transfer agent thereof, and:
Transfer of Stock
(a) in the case of certificated shares, (i) by delivery of the certificate endorsed either in blank or to a specified person by the person appearing by the certificate to be the owner of the shares represented thereby or (ii) by delivery of the certificate and a separate document containing a written assignment of the certificate or a power of attorney to sell, assign or transfer the same or the shares represented thereby, signed by the person appearing by the certificate to be the owner of the shares represented thereby. Such assignment or power of attorney may be either in blank or to a specified person; or
(b) in the case of uncertificated shares, upon receipt of transfer instructions (as may be determined proper by the Corporation or its transfer agent) from the registered owner of such uncertificated shares, from a duly authorized attorney or from an individual presenting evidence of succession, assignment or authority (as may be determined proper by the Corporation or its transfer agent) to transfer the stock.
SECTION 3. . The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of shares of stock of the Corporation as the absolute and exclusive owner thereof for all purposes, including without limitation the right to receive dividends, the right to vote and liability for calls and assessments, and, accordingly, the Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any person, whether or not the Corporation shall have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by statute.
Registered Holders
SECTION 4. . The Board may make such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, concerning the issue, transfer and registration of shares of stock of the Corporation. It may appoint, or authorize any principal officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer clerks or one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all certificates for shares of stock of the Corporation to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.
Regulations
SECTION 5. . The Corporation may issue a new stock certificate or uncertificated stock in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner's
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New Certificates
 
legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated stock.
SECTION 1. . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, the Board may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing such record date is adopted by the Board and (a) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, unless otherwise required by statute, shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting or (b) in the case of any other action (other than stockholder action by written consent), shall not be more than 60 days prior to any such other action. If no record date is fixed: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose (other than stockholder action by written consent) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
Fixing of Record Date for Stockholder Meetings
SECTION 2. . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation, request the Board to fix a record date. The Board shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has been previously fixed by the Board pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2). If no record date has been fixed by the Board within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by statute, shall be the first date after the expiration of such 10-day time period on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's
Fixing of Record Date for Actions by Written Consent
 
registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by statute, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
Whenever notice is required to be given by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a waiver thereof, by the person entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when such person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any waiver of notice.
Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account and minute books, may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form of, any information storage device or method, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time.
The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be determined by resolution of the Board.
The Board from time to time may adopt, alter, amend or repeal these Bylaws. The stockholders may also adopt, alter, amend or repeal these Bylaws at any meeting provided that notice of such proposed adoption, alteration, amendment or repeal is included in the notice of such meeting.
