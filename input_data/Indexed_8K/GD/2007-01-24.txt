During a conference call with securities analysts earlier today, Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, described anticipated conditions in the defense sector for 2007 and provided guidance for expected revenue, net income and earnings per share for the company's fiscal year 2007, which ends December 31.
Chabraja said, with respect to the company's three defense segments, "[Our] projections reflect our best estimate of the impact of funding from the Defense Appropriations supplemental spending bills. Precise forecasting is becoming increasingly difficult because of a lack of programmatic details attendant to supplementals and the greater-than-normal delays between the approval of supplementals and the issuance of contracts. I would caution you as I have before not to overreact to the impact or timing of supplemental activity."
Chabraja said the company expects 2007 revenues of approximately $26.3 billion; net income of approximately $1.9 billion; and fully diluted earnings per share of approximately $4.60, a 9.5 percent increase over the 2006 fully diluted earnings per share announced earlier today.
Quarter-by-quarter, the company expects 2007 earnings to be: first quarter, $1.02; second quarter, $1.10; third quarter, $1.19; fourth quarter, $1.29.
In addition, Chabraja said that the company's Board of Directors had asked him and he intended to extend his employment agreement through at least the first half of 2009. Chabraja expects the formalization of this extension to occur in the spring of 2007.
