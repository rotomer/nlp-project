, Va.  General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported first-quarter 2007 earnings from continuing operations of $440 million, or $1.07 per share on a fully diluted basis.

The results represent a 13.7 percent increase in earnings from continuing operations and a 13.6 percent increase in revenues over the first quarter of 2006.
FALLS CHURCH
Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the quarter totaled $522 million. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures, was $469 million for the period.
Backlog
The company's funded backlog grew by approximately $500 million in the first quarter of 2007, to $34.5 billion. Total backlog at the end of the quarter was $43.6 billion, essentially unchanged from the end of the fourth quarter of 2006. Compared to the year-ago period, funded backlog grew by more than 18 percent, and total backlog grew by 8.6 percent.
Margins
Company-wide operating margins for the first quarter of 2007 increased by 10 basis points over the first quarter of 2006, to 10.8 percent.
 
Net Earnings
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2007 were $434 million, compared to $374 million in the first quarter of 2006. Net earnings include the operating results of the company's coal mining business, which is for sale and reported as discontinued operations.
"General Dynamics' performance in the first quarter of 2007 was very strong," said company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas D. Chabraja. "Revenue and earnings grew substantially over the first quarter of 2006 and significant orders in Aerospace and Combat Systems, demonstrating persistent demand for each group's products, contributed to the strength of the backlog. Information Systems and Technology maintained its double-digit margin rate, and the Marine Systems group continued to show margin improvement year-over-year. Free cash flow from operations in the quarter of $469 million, or 107 percent of earnings from continuing operations, once again represents a very efficient conversion of earnings into cash."
Operational highlights in the quarter include record sales of nearly $1.1 billion in the Aerospace segment, an increase of 17.8 percent over first-quarter 2006, reflecting higher quantities of green-aircraft deliveries and new-aircraft completions compared to last year. In addition, Combat Systems was awarded significant orders for new vehicles, vehicle repair and logistics support services, and rockets and ammunition in the quarter.
