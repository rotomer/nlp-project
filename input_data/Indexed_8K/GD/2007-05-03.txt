On May 3, 2007 the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision upholding the government's default termination of the A-12 contract. This is the latest decision relating to litigation begun in 1991 resulting from the A-12 contract termination.
The Company disagrees with this most recent ruling and continues to believe that the government's default termination was not justified. The Company also believes that the ruling raises serious issues for appeal, and intends to pursue its right to appeal.
Final resolution of the A-12 litigation will depend on the outcome of further proceedings or possible negotiations with the government.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
