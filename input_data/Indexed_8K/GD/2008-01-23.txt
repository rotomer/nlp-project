FALLS CHURCH
Fourth-Quarter Results
General Dynamics' earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter 2007 were $578 million, or $1.42 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to 2006 fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $463 million, or $1.13 per share fully diluted. Revenue for the fourth quarter 2007 was $7.5 billion, compared to fourth-quarter 2006 revenue of $6.5 billion.
Full-year 2007 Results
Earnings from continuing operations for 2007 were $2.1 billion, or $5.10 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared with $1.7 billion, or $4.20 fully diluted, in 2006. This is an increase of 21.6 percent. Revenue for the full year 2007 was $27.2 billion, compared with $24.1 billion for 2006, an increase of 13.2 percent.
Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled $1.07 billion in the quarter and $2.95 billion for the year. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures, was $891 million in the quarter and $2.48 billion for the year.
 
Backlog
The company's funded backlog grew by $292 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, to $37.2 billion. Compared to year-end 2006, funded backlog increased $3.2 billion. Total backlog at year-end 2007 was $46.8 billion.
Margins
Operating margins for the fourth quarter 2007 increased to 11.6 percent from 10.8 percent for fourth quarter 2006. For the full year, company-wide operating margins increased by 50 basis points over 2006, to 11.4 percent.
Net Earnings
General Dynamics' net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $579 million, compared to fourth-quarter 2006 net earnings of $408 million, which included charges in discontinued operations related to the anticipated sale of the company's coal mining operations. Net earnings for the full year were $2.07 billion in 2007, compared to $1.86 billion in 2006 which included a gain in discontinued operations from the sale of the company's aggregates business.
"General Dynamics generated solid returns in the fourth quarter of 2007," said General Dynamics Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas D. Chabraja. "Revenues and earnings grew substantially over the fourth quarter of 2006, and operating margins increased 80 basis points, to 11.6 percent, when compared to the fourth quarter 2006. Free cash flow from operations in the quarter was $891 million, or more than 150 percent of net earnings.
"Highlights of the quarter included significant revenue and earnings growth in the Combat Systems group on strong combat-vehicle sales, including Abrams tank modernization and Stryker production, as well as significant sales and earnings increases in the Aerospace group," Chabraja said. "Marine Systems once again improved margin rates, on a modest increase in sales volume, contributing to another year of strong performance across the corporation. Notably, total backlog in the Information Systems and Technology segment grew $300 million on the strength of $3 billion in orders, reflecting a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2.
"Given our strong performance in 2007, the record backlog and strong support for our programs, we expect 2008 earnings to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.65 per share, fully diluted," Chabraja said.
