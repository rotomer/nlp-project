Margins
Company-wide operating margins for the first quarter of 2008 increased 150 basis points over the first quarter of 2007, to 12.3 percent.
Backlog
The company's funded and total backlog each grew by approximately $2.9 billion in the first quarter of 2008, to $40 billion and $49.8 billion respectively at the end of the period. Compared to first-quarter 2007, funded backlog grew by 16 percent and total backlog grew by 14.1 percent.
Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the quarter totaled $431 million. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures, was $346 million for the period.
"General Dynamics' performance in the first quarter of 2008 was excellent," said Nicholas D. Chabraja, chairman and chief executive officer. "Earnings grew substantially over the first quarter of 2007, and significant sales-volume increases in Combat Systems, Marine Systems and the Aerospace segment reflect ongoing demand for each group's products. While revenue in Information Systems and Technology was essentially unchanged year-over-year, the group's operating earnings and margin rates increased for the period.
"Orders in the quarter were very strong, with $2.9 billion in future revenue being added to the company's funded backlog. Notable contract awards include $1.2 billion for upgrades to Abrams tanks, $1.1 billion for a Virginia-class submarine and $1.4 billion for construction of the first DDG-1000 Zumwalt-class destroyer.
"Strong operating performance, lower interest expense and stock-repurchase activity in the quarter all contributed to a 34 percent increase in earnings per share on a fully diluted basis compared to the first quarter of 2007," Chabraja said.
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, employs approximately 84,000 people worldwide. The company is a market leader in business aviation; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and information systems and technologies.
