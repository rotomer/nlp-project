Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter totaled $1 billion. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures, was $910 million for the period, or 142 percent of net earnings.
For the first half of 2008, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, while free cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion.
Margins
Company-wide operating margins for the second quarter of 2008 increased 110 basis points over the second quarter of 2007, to 12.6 percent.
Backlog
The company's funded backlog grew by approximately $5.2 billion or 12.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008, on strong orders for new aircraft in the Aerospace group, as well as demand for tanks, combat vehicles, tactical communications systems and information technology services. Compared to first-quarter 2008, company-wide total backlog grew by 11.2 percent.
 
Taxes
The company's 2008 second-quarter financial results include a $35 million benefit from the favorable settlement of a tax-refund suit; this factor increased earnings by approximately 9 cents per share in the quarter.
Operational Highlights
Sales, earnings and operating margins increased in all four General Dynamics business groups in the second quarter. The Combat Systems group experienced increased sales in its armored vehicle and tank programs compared to the year-ago period and significant margin growth. New-aircraft volume in the Aerospace group, increased shipbuilding activity in Marine Systems and continued strong demand for tactical communications and computing systems in the Information Systems and Technology sector also contributed to the overall strong performance.
"General Dynamics' performance continued to be strong in the second quarter of 2008," said Nicholas D. Chabraja, chairman and chief executive officer. "Sales, earnings and operating margins increased in all four business segments compared to the year-ago period, cash generation was exceptionally strong and the robust backlog suggests continued healthy demand for the products and services of each business area.
"Growth in the Aerospace backlog is a reflection of continued demand for the entire existing product line and extremely strong demand for the new Gulfstream G650. We are very pleased to see this interest in the new plane and view that as an indicator of Gulfstream's ability to anticipate and exceed its customers' product expectations.
"On the basis of these results and a clearer sense of what the remainder of 2008 will bring, we expect full-year 2008 earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $6.00 to $6.05 per share, fully diluted," Chabraja said.
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, employs approximately 84,600 people worldwide and reported $27.2 billion in revenue in 2007. The company is a market leader in business aviation; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and mission-critical information systems and technologies.
