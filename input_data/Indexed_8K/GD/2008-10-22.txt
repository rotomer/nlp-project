General Dynamics Reports Strong Earnings, Backlog Growth in Third Quarter 2008
 
 General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported 2008 third-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $634 million, or $1.59 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to 2007 third-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $544 million, or $1.34 per share fully diluted. Revenues rose to $7.1 billion in the quarter, a 4.5 percent increase over third-quarter 2007 revenues of $6.8 billion. Net earnings, which were equal to earnings from continuing operations, increased 16 percent over the year-ago period.
FALLS CHURCH, Va.
Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $863 million for the third quarter, or 136 percent of net earnings. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures, was $749 million, or 118 percent of net earnings.
Backlog
Funded backlog at the end of the third quarter 2008 was $49.7 billion, and total backlog was $60.5 billion, compared to $45.2 billion and $55.3 billion, respectively, at the end of the second quarter 2008. Backlog growth in the quarter included significant increases in three of the company's four business groups.
Margins
Operating margins increased in each of General Dynamics' four business groups during the third quarter of 2008. Company-wide, operating margins were 13.1 percent, a 140-basis-point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2007.
Performance Highlights
Sales in the third quarter increased in the Aerospace, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups when compared to the year-ago period. Continued customer demand generated new orders on several of the company's key vehicle programs  including the Army's Stryker infantry combat vehicle and Abrams tank upgrades  resulting in substantial backlog growth in Combat Systems. The strong appeal of the Aerospace group's large-cabin products generated significant additional backlog in that segment as well.
"This was a powerful quarter for General Dynamics," said company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas D. Chabraja. "As the company's core defense programs demonstrated their continued strength and the market for business-jet aircraft drove the Aerospace backlog to its highest level ever, we improved margins company-wide and generated substantial cash by maintaining our focus on solid execution.
"These factors  a durable and growing backlog, sustained performance improvement and strong cash flow  position the company to continue creating shareholder value," Chabraja said.
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Va., employs approximately 85,600 people worldwide. The company is a market leader in business aviation; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and information systems and technologies.
