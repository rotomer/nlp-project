On April 23, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of General Dynamics Corporation took the following actions:
 
 
 
 
 
"Shares of Common Stock subject to an Award that expire unexercised, or that are forfeited, terminated or canceled (in whole or in part), shall thereafter again be available for grant under the Plan, except as otherwise provided by the Committee. To the extent any shares of Common Stock covered by an Award are not issued to a Participant or Beneficiary because instead such shares are used to satisfy the applicable tax withholding obligations or to pay the purchase price of any Option or other Award or to the extent unrestricted shares of Common Stock are delivered by a Participant or Beneficiary to satisfy such obligations, then any such withheld or delivered shares shall be available for grant pursuant to the Plan, except as otherwise provided by the Committee."
The amended Plan will be presented for shareholder approval at the company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Wednesday, May 6, 2009.
A copy of the General Dynamics 2009 Equity Compensation Plan incorporating the amendments (marked to show the amendments) is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
The purpose of the Plan is to provide the Company with an effective means of attracting, retaining, and motivating directors, officers and key employees, and to provide them with incentives to enhance the growth and profitability of the Company.
 
 
The Plan was adopted by the Board on March 4, 2009, subject to approval by the stockholders of the Parent. If the Plan is not approved by the stockholders before the first anniversary of its adoption by the Board, then the Plan will automatically terminate and be of no force or effect. Awards may be made pursuant to the Plan through and including the 10 year anniversary of the date of the latest stockholder approval of the Plan, including without limitation any stockholder approval of any amendment to the Plan to increase the share award capacity hereunder.
and amended by the Committee on April 23, 2009,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any officer or employee of the Company is eligible for selection by the Committee for an Award under this Plan. Awards to Non-Employee Directors may be granted pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan.
 
 
The Committee shall determine the amounts and types of the Awards and the terms and conditions of such Awards, consistent with the terms of this Plan. Awards may be made in Common Stock, Options, Restricted Stock, Participation Units, or in any combination thereof. If any Award is settled in cash that is to be paid on a deferred basis, the Participant may be entitled, on terms and conditions as the Committee may determine, to be paid interest on the unpaid amount.
 
Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, and to the extent permitted pursuant to applicable rules of the national securities exchange or such other market on which Common Stock is principally traded and the Committee charter, the chairperson of the Committee may make Awards on behalf of the Committee to any Participant, other than a Participant subject to Section 16 of the Act or a Participant who is a "covered employee" under Code Section 162(m)(3) (or any successor provision thereto).
 
 
Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 14 of the Plan, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for grants of Awards (including the shares underlying Options, Restricted Stock and Participation Units) pursuant to the Plan is 32,000,000. The maximum number of shares available for ISOs and Non-Statutory Stock Options pursuant to the Plan is 32,000,000. The maximum number of shares available for grants of Restricted Stock and Participation Units pursuant to the Plan is . The shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Plan may come from authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares or shares purchased by the Company in the open market.
10,000,000
5,000,000
Shares of Common Stock subject to an Award that expire unexercised, or that are forfeited, terminated or canceled (in whole or in part), shall thereafter again be available for grant pursuant to the Plan, except as otherwise provided by the Committee. To the extent any shares of Common Stock covered by an Award are not issued to a Participant or Beneficiary because instead such shares are used to satisfy the applicable tax withholding obligation or to pay the purchase price of any Option or other Award or to the extent unrestricted shares of Common Stock are delivered by a Participant or Beneficiary to satisfy such obligations, then any such withheld or delivered shares shall be available for grant pursuant to the Plan, except as otherwise provided by the Committee.
 
 
Awards may be based on the attainment by the Participant, Company or any Company business unit over a specified period of time, of performance goals pre-established by the Committee (or Subcommittee, as applicable), based on one or more of the following criteria (as determined in
 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as applicable): (a) market price of Common Stock, (b) earnings per share of Common Stock, (d) net income or profit (before or after taxes), (d) return on total stockholder equity, (e) return of stockholders' equity, (f) cash flow, (g) cumulative return on net assets employed, (h) earnings before interest and taxes, (i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, (j) earnings from continuing operations, (k) sales or revenues, (l) return on assets, capital or investment, (m) market share, (n) cost reduction goals, (o) budget comparisons, (p) implementation or completion of specified projects or processes, (q) the formation of joint ventures, research or development collaborations, or the completion of other transactions, or (r) any combination of any of the foregoing. To the extent permitted under Code Section 162(m) (including, without limitation, compliance with any of the requirements for stockholder approval) and prior to an Award being granted, the Subcommittee may designate additional business criteria on which the performance goals may be based or adjust, modify or amend the aforementioned business criteria.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, no one Participant, in any calendar year, shall be granted an Award with respect to more than:
 
 
 
The limitations set forth in this section shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14, but only to the extent such adjustment would not affect the status of compensation attributable to Awards hereunder as qualifying under the performance-based compensation provisions of Code Section 162(m) and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Change in Control" means any of the following events:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A transaction described in clauses (A) through (C) above is referred to herein as a "Non-Control Transaction."
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control will not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (a "Subject Person") acquires Beneficial Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the outstanding voting securities of the Parent as a result of the acquisition of voting securities by the Parent which, by reducing the number of voting securities outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of voting securities by the Company, then a Change in Control shall be deemed to occur on the date the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional voting securities which increases the percentage of the then outstanding voting securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person.
 
For purposes of the definition of Change in Control in this Section 15, "subsidiary" means any corporation with respect to which another specified corporation has the power under ordinary circumstances to vote or direct the voting of sufficient securities to elect a majority of the directors.
 
 
In connection with the vesting of Awards or issuance of Common Stock under the Plan (including without limitation Restricted Stock to the extent taxable), the Parent may require the recipient to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy any Federal, state or local (including foreign jurisdictions) tax withholding requirements prior to the delivery of such Common Stock, or, in the discretion of the Committee, the Parent may withhold from the shares to be delivered shares sufficient to satisfy all or a portion of the minimum statutorily required tax withholding requirements. The Committee may determine the manner in which such tax withholding may be satisfied, and may permit a Participant to deliver unrestricted shares of Common Stock to be used to satisfy minimum statutorily required tax withholding based on the Fair Market Value of any such shares of Common Stock on the date the amount of tax to be withheld is determined. Any cash paid pursuant to the Plan is subject to all applicable tax withholding.
 
 
The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.
 
 
The Committee may at any time suspend the operation of, terminate or amend the Plan or any Award thereunder, provided that no termination, modification, suspension, or amendment shall adversely impair the rights of any Participant pursuant to an outstanding Award without the consent of the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may take such actions as it deems appropriate to ensure that the Plan and any Awards may comply with any tax, securities or other applicable law. Nothing herein shall restrict the Committee's ability to exercise its discretionary authority as provided in the Plan.
 
 
Nothing contained in the Plan shall be deemed to preclude other compensation plans which may be in effect from time to time or be construed to limit the authority of the Company to exercise its corporate rights and powers, including, but not by way of limitation, the right of the Parent (a) to award options to acquire shares of Common Stock otherwise than under the Plan to an employee or other person, firm, corporation, or association, or (b) to award options to acquire shares of Common Stock, or assume the option of, any person in connection with the acquisition, by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of the business and assets (in whole or in part) of any person, firm, corporation, or association.
 
 
The Committee may adopt, amend, and terminate such arrangements, not inconsistent with the intent of the Plan, as it may deem necessary or desirable to make available tax or other benefits of the laws of any foreign jurisdiction, to Participants who are subject to such laws and who receive Awards under the Plan.
 
 
The validity, construction, interpretation, administration and effect of the Plan, and its rules and regulations, and rights relating to the Plan and to Awards granted pursuant to the Plan, shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any law that would cause the laws of any other jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware to be applied.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All notices to the Parent regarding the Plan shall be in writing, effective as of actual receipt by the Parent, and shall be sent to:
 
General Dynamics Corporation
2941 Fairview Park Drive
Falls Church, Virginia 22042
Attention: Corporate Secretary
 
The Committee may change the address to which notices under the Plan are sent provided such address is communicated to Participants and Beneficiaries.
