Funded backlog at the end of second-quarter 2009 increased 5.3 percent from one year ago, to $47.7 billion.

"General Dynamics continued to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio in the second quarter of 2009," said Jay L. Johnson, president and chief executive officer. "Revenues grew in each of the company's four operating segments, and our operating earnings of $945 million were the highest in company history. Our commitment to financial performance and continuously improving execution generated very strong results.
"Based on the company's year-to-date performance and our understanding of what the remainder of 2009 will bring, we are raising our earlier guidance for full-year 2009 earnings from continuing operations, to $6.05 to $6.15 per share, fully diluted," Johnson said.
