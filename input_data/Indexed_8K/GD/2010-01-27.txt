FALLS CHURCH
Margins
Company-wide operating margins increased to 12 percent for the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by improved performance at each of the company's defense businesses. Notably, operating margins increased in Combat Systems by 160 basis points; Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology also improved margin performance, by 50 and 80 basis points, respectively, in the quarter.
Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.86 billion for the full year. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $1.36 billion in the quarter and $2.47 billion for the year. Free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations was 103 percent for the year.
Backlog
The company's total backlog was $65.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, reflecting increases in both Aerospace and Combat Systems over the end of the third quarter. In Aerospace, new-aircraft order activity continued to be strong in the fourth quarter. Combat Systems received significant orders in the quarter as well, including a $2.2 billion contract for a foreign military sale of light armored vehicles, and $320 million for design, engineering, modernization and enhancements of Stryker vehicles for the U.S. Army.
Funded backlog at the end of fourth-quarter 2009 was $45.9 billion. In addition, the estimated potential contract value, representing management's estimate of the value of unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options, was $17.6 billion at year-end 2009. Total potential contract value, the sum of all backlog components, was $83.1 billion at the end of the year.
Net Earnings
General Dynamics' net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $614 million, compared to fourth-quarter 2008 net earnings of $612 million. Net earnings for the full year were $2.39 billion in 2009, compared to $2.46 billion in 2008.
"General Dynamics performed well in 2009," said Jay L. Johnson, president and chief executive officer. "The strength of our diverse portfolio was evident as continuing customer demand for our defense-related products balanced the impact of the global economic challenges on business aviation. By marrying that strength with our commitment to financial performance and effective execution, the business generated strong margins and excellent cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the full year.
"Based on the company's performance in 2009 and our current understanding of the year ahead, we expect 2010 earnings to be in the range of $6.40 to $6.50 per share, fully diluted," Johnson said.
