Margins
Company-wide operating margins for the first quarter of 2010 were 11.8 percent, compared to 11 percent in the year-ago period. Aerospace and Combat Systems margin growth was especially strong, increasing by 240 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively.
Backlog
Funded backlog at the end of first-quarter 2010 grew to $47.4 billion, a 3 percent increase over the end of the fourth quarter 2009. Significant orders received include contracts valued at $845 million for construction of two additional T-AKE combat-logistics ships and $115 million for construction materials for an additional DDG-51 destroyer for the U.S. Navy, and $515 million for Stryker vehicle production and support for the U.S. Army. The Information Systems and Technology group was awarded a contract valued at $340 million to initiate production of the second increment of Army's next-generation on-the-move tactical battlefield network, called WIN-T. The Aerospace group saw strong order activity in the quarter, particularly among large-cabin Gulfstream aircraft.
The company's total backlog at the end of the first quarter 2010 was $63.9 billion, and the estimated potential contract value was an additional $17 billion, which represents management's estimate of value under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options.
Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter totaled $210 million. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $150 million for the period.
"General Dynamics delivered a strong operational performance in the first quarter of 2010," said Jay L. Johnson, president and chief executive officer. "Operating margins across the company were steady or improving, demonstrating the benefits of our commitment to continuous improvement, and we saw good order activity across the corporation. On balance, General Dynamics delivered solid results, giving us a good first step down the path toward meeting our overall performance objectives for the year," Johnson said.
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, employs approximately 91,200 people worldwide.
