General Dynamics Reports Strong Performance in Third Quarter 2010
 
 
, Va.  General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported third-quarter 2010 earnings from continuing operations of $649 million, or $1.70 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to 2009 third-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $575 million, or $1.48 per share fully diluted. Revenues in the quarter were $8 billion. Operating earnings grew by 10.5 percent over third-quarter 2009, to $966 million.
FALLS CHURCH
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $650 million, compared to $572 million in the year-ago period. Net earnings on a per-share, fully diluted basis were $1.70 in the current quarter, an increase of 15.6 percent over the year-ago period.
Margins
Company-wide operating margins in the quarter were 12.1 percent, an increase of 80 basis points over third-quarter 2009. Aerospace and Combat Systems margins drove that improvement, increasing 420 and 150 basis points respectively.
Backlog
The company's funded backlog at the end of the quarter was $45.6 billion and total backlog was $61.8 billion. Orders received reflected continuing demand for the company's aerospace and defense products alike.
Significant orders in the quarter included awards for production of double-V hulled Stryker combat vehicles, ammunition, reactive armor and crew-served weapon systems; lead-yard
 
services for the DDG-51 destroyer program; and long-lead materials and design services for the new class of Mobile Landing Platform ships. In the Information Systems and Technology group, customer demand continued for tactical networking systems and rugged computing products, as well as information-technology infrastructure and support services.
In addition to the total backlog, the company's estimated potential contract value was $20.8 billion at the end of third-quarter 2010, reflecting management's estimate of the value of unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options.
Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter totaled $880 million. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $784 million for the period.
"General Dynamics continues to demonstrate its ability to effectively execute on its programs," said Jay L. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer. "Margins remain strong across the corporation, and the quality of earnings was underscored by strong free cash flow. This solid operating performance reflects our continued focus on increasing efficiency, improving productivity and driving cost out of our businesses.
"As a result of our performance this quarter, we are increasing our expectations for full-year 2010 earnings from continuing operations to the range of $6.70 to $6.75 per share, fully diluted," Johnson said.
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, employs approximately 90,000 people worldwide. The company is a market leader in business aviation; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and information systems and technologies.
