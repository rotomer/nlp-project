Margins
Company-wide operating margins for the first quarter of 2011 were 11.9 percent, compared to 11.8 percent in first-quarter 2010. Operating margins for Aerospace, Combat Systems and Marine Systems grew when compared to the year-ago period.
Backlog
Funded backlog at the end of first-quarter 2011 was $43.9 billion. The Aerospace backlog increased for a second consecutive quarter, driven by continued demand for Gulfstream aircraft. Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology also received several notable orders in the first quarter, including $325 million from a foreign military customer for combat vehicle structures and $295 million for initial production of equipment for the second increment of the U.S. Army's WIN-T next-generation battlefield communications network.
The company's total backlog at the end of the first quarter 2011 was $57.6 billion, and the estimated potential contract value was an additional $20.6 billion, which represents management's estimate of value under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options.
Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter totaled $327 million. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $266 million for the period.
"General Dynamics' first-quarter performance reflects the stability and relevance of our defense programs and continuing demand for our global business-aviation products and services," said Jay L. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer. "By remaining focused on execution and leveraging the strength of our diverse portfolio, we delivered a solid first-quarter and remain on track for another strong year."
