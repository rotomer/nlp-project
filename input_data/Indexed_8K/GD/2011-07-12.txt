reasonably likely to have a material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws (each as amended) of any of the Issuers or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Issuers or any of their properties (but no opinion is expressed in this paragraph as to compliance with any disclosure requirement or any prohibition against fraud or misrepresentation or as to whether performance of the indemnification or contribution provisions in the Underwriting Agreement would be permitted); and each of the Issuers has the corporate power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Securities as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement;

(xi) none of the Issuers is an "investment company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act.
The purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish factual matters, and the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus involved many determinations of a wholly or partially nonlegal character. Except to the extent otherwise explicitly indicated in numbered paragraph (viii) above, we make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus or that the actions taken in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus (including the actions described in the next paragraph) were sufficient to cause the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information or the Registration Statement to be accurate, complete or fair. We are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus or the Registration Statement, except to the extent otherwise explicitly indicated in numbered paragraph (viii) above.
 
We have participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus. During the course of such preparation, we examined various documents, including those listed at the beginning of our letter, and participated in various conferences with representatives and counsel of the Corporation, with representatives of the independent accountants for the Corporation and representatives of and counsel to the Underwriters, at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (and the documents incorporated therein by reference) were reviewed and discussed.
Based on our participation in the conferences and discussions identified above, our understanding of applicable law and the experience that we have gained in the practice thereunder and relying as to factual matters to the extent we deem appropriate upon the representations and statements of officers and other representatives of the Corporation, we advise you that no fact came to our attention to cause us to conclude that (i) the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date, or as of the date of this letter, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except for, in each case, financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical and similar data and information included therein or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we express no opinion.
Except for the activities described in the immediately preceding section of this letter, we have not undertaken any investigation to determine the facts upon which the advice in this letter is based.
We have assumed for purposes of this letter: each document we have reviewed for purposes of this letter is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; that the Underwriting Agreement and every other agreement we have examined for purposes of this letter constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each party to that document and that each such party has satisfied all legal requirements that are applicable to such party to the extent necessary to entitle such party to enforce such agreement (except that we make no such assumption with respect to the
 
Corporation or the Guarantors); and that you have acted in good faith and without notice of any fact which has caused you to reach any conclusion contrary to any of the advice provided in this letter. We have also made other assumptions which we believe to be appropriate for purposes of this letter.
In preparing this letter we have relied without independent verification upon: (i) information contained in certificates obtained from governmental authorities; (ii) factual information represented to be true in the Underwriting Agreement, in the other documents specifically identified at the beginning of this letter as having been read by us and in the certificates and other documents executed by the Corporation and the Guarantors and delivered to you or to the trustee under the Indenture in connection with the consummation of the Offering; (iii) numbered paragraphs 1 and 5 of the opinion of Gregory S. Gallopoulos, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Corporation, with respect to the Offering; (iv) factual information provided to us by the Corporation or its representatives; and (v) factual information we have obtained from such other sources as we have deemed reasonable. We have assumed that there has been no relevant change or development between the dates as of which the information cited in the preceding sentence was given and the date of this letter and that the information upon which we have relied is accurate and does not omit disclosures necessary to prevent such information from being misleading.
We confirm that we do not have knowledge that has caused us to conclude that our reliance and assumptions cited in the two immediately preceding paragraphs are unwarranted. Whenever this letter provides advice about (or based upon) our knowledge of any particular information or about any information which has or has not come to our attention such advice is based entirely on the conscious awareness at the time this letter is delivered on the date it bears by the lawyers with Jenner & Block LLP at that time who have engaged in substantive representation of the Corporation in connection with (i) the Offering and (ii) the preparation and filing of reports required to be filed with the Commission by the Corporation pursuant to the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.
Our advice on every legal issue addressed in this letter is based exclusively on the internal law of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the federal law of the United States, and represents our opinion as to how that issue would be resolved were it to be considered by the highest court in the jurisdiction which enacted such law. With respect to our opinions above, we have assumed, with your permission, that the laws of states of Maine, Nevada and Virginia are the same as the laws of the State of Delaware. Our opinions are limited to the specific issues addressed. None of the opinions or other advice contained in this letter considers or covers: (i) any foreign or state securities (or "") laws or regulations; (ii) any financial statements or supporting schedules (or any notes to any such statements or
blue sky
 
schedules) or other financial information set forth or incorporated by reference in (or omitted from) the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus; (iii) any rules and regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) relating to the compensation of Underwriters; or (iv) the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, LLC or any other relevant securities exchange. This letter does not cover any other laws, statutes, governmental rules or regulations or decisions which in our experience are not usually considered for or covered by opinions like those contained in this letter or are not generally applicable to transactions of the kind covered by the Underwriting Agreement.
This letter speaks as of the time of its delivery on the date it bears. We do not assume any obligation to provide you with any subsequent opinion or advice by reason of any fact about which we did not have knowledge at that time, by reason of any change subsequent to that time in any law, other governmental requirement or interpretation thereof covered by any of our opinions or advice, or for any other reason.
This letter may be relied upon by the Underwriters only for the purpose served by the provision in the Underwriting Agreement cited in the initial paragraph of this letter in response to which it has been delivered. Without our written consent: (i) no person other than the Underwriters may rely on this letter for any purpose (except that the Trustee may rely upon paragraph (ii) of this letter in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Indenture to the same extent as if this letter had been addressed to the Trustee); (ii) this letter may not be cited or quoted in any financial statement, prospectus, private placement memorandum or other similar document; (iii) this letter may not be cited or quoted in any other document or communication which might encourage reliance upon this letter by any person or for any purpose excluded by the restrictions in this paragraph; and (iv) copies of this letter may not be furnished to anyone for purposes of encouraging such reliance.

[The Representatives]
as representatives of the several Underwriters party
to the Underwriting Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am the Senior Vice President and General Counsel of General Dynamics Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ""), and I have acted as legal counsel in connection with that Underwriting Agreement by and among the Company, the Guarantors named therein and [Name of Representatives] dated [ ], 20[] (the ""). This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 6(f) of the Underwriting Agreement. Initially capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
Company
            
    
    
Underwriting Agreement
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I am familiar with, and either I or those under my supervision have examined the following documents, in each case including the documents incorporated by reference therein: the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
I have also made such investigations of law, relied as to factual matters on such other documents and instruments and reviewed information or held such conferences with officers and employees of the Company, as I have deemed appropriate. As to any fact material to my opinion, I have (with your permission and without any investigation or independent confirmation) assumed the accuracy of such instruments, certificates and documents with respect to the facts stated therein. In rendering the opinion that follows, I have assumed and not verified (i) the genuineness of the signatures of persons signing all documents and instruments in connection with which this opinion is rendered other than on behalf of the Company and the Guarantors, (ii) the authority of such persons signing all documents on behalf of the parties thereto other than the Company and the Guarantors, (iii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, (iv) the conformity to the original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, (v) that all documents which must be executed and delivered by parties other than the Company and the Guarantors to be effective have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such other parties and (vi) that the Notes have been fully paid for.
In clauses 1, 3 and 4 below, I have relied exclusively upon certificates or other documents from public officials as to the matters stated in such documents and certificates and such opinion is not intended to provide any conclusion or assurance beyond that conveyed by such document or certificate.
 
Based on the foregoing and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations as may be set forth below, it is my opinion that:
1. each of the Guarantors has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation;
2. all of the issued shares of capital stock of each Guarantor have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and (except for directors' qualifying shares) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all encumbrances, equities or claims;
3. the Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not result in a material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise;
4. each of the Guarantors has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not result in a material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), financial position or results of operations of the applicable Guarantor; and
5. to the best of my knowledge after reasonable investigation, neither the Company nor any Guarantor is (a) in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, as amended, or (b) in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, or lease or agreement or other material instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound, where such default is reasonably expected by the Company to have a material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise.
Although I have not independently verified and am not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, no information has come to my attention that leads me to
 
believe that (i) the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date, or as of the date of this letter, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except for, in each case, financial statements and schedules and other financial and statistical and similar data and information included therein or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which I express no opinion.
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Illinois and am qualified as Corporate Counsel Registrant in the State of Virginia. This opinion is limited to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the internal law of the State of Illinois and the federal securities laws of the United States, and I express no opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction. I know that the Underwriting Agreement is stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York. However, for purposes of rendering the opinion, I have assumed, with your permission, that the Underwriting Agreement is stated to be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois. My opinions are limited to the specific issues addressed and are limited in all respects to laws and facts existing on the date hereof. By rendering my opinions, I do not undertake to advise you of any changes in such laws, or facts that may occur after the date hereof.
This opinion is furnished only for your benefit and may not be relied upon by any other person or entity, nor may copies be delivered or disclosed to any other person or entity, without my prior written consent.

Indenture
The Company at its option may, at any time and from time to time, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon payment of a redemption price (the "") equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points; provided that if the Company redeems any Notes on or after April 15, 2021 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), the Redemption Price for those Notes will equal 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed. The Redemption Price for the Notes will include accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to but excluding the Redemption Date.

If the Notes are only partially redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided, that if at the time of redemption the Notes are registered as Global Securities, the Depository shall determine, in accordance with its procedures, the principal amount of such Notes held by each Holder of Notes to be redeemed. The Redemption Price shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York time, on the Redemption Date or such earlier time as the Company determines, provided that the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the Redemption Price by 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the date such Redemption Price is to be paid.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of each series affected at the time outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) change the fixed maturity of any Notes of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Note so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Notes, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holders of each Note then outstanding and affected thereby.

Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange therefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto.
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and the Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and premium, if any, and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
