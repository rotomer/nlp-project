General Dynamics Reports Fourth-quarter,
Full-year 2011 Performance
 
 General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported 2011 fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $603 million, or $1.68 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to 2010 fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $729 million, or $1.91 per share fully diluted.
FALLS CHURCH, Va.
Fourth-quarter earnings were impacted by charges taken at the company's Switzerland-based aircraft-completions business totaling $189 million. The charges comprise a $111 million non-cash impairment of an intangible asset related to the business and $78 million in contract losses.
"Jet Aviation's aircraft-completions business continued to face lower OEM business-jet volume and delays in several narrow-body and wide-body aircraft which are nearing delivery," said Jay L. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer. "We have taken appropriate steps to address these issues.
"The charges taken in our completions business mask an otherwise solid fourth-quarter performance by General Dynamics, marked by excellent cash generation, delivery of the first 12 Gulfstream G650 production aircraft to the final phase of manufacturing, and strong margins in our defense businesses," Johnson continued.
Revenue and Full-year Earnings
Fourth-quarter 2011 revenue was $9.1 billion, and revenue was $32.7 billion for the full year. Full-year 2011 earnings from continuing operations were $2.55 billion, or $6.94 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to $2.63 billion and $6.82 per share, respectively, for 2010.
 
Margins
Company-wide operating margins, which include the impact of the charges in Aerospace, were 10.4 percent for the fourth quarter and 11.7 percent for the full year. These margins reflect the continued strong performance in the company's defense groups, each of which increased their operating margins in the quarter and for the year.
Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2 billion in the fourth quarter and $3.2 billion for the full year. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $1.8 billion in the quarter and $2.8 billion for the year. Free cash flow exceeded earnings from continuing operations in the fourth quarter and for the full year, benefitting from progress payments received by the Aerospace group as the new Gulfstream G650 business-jet aircraft received provisional type certification and the first 12 production aircraft were delivered into final-phase manufacturing.
Backlog
The company's total backlog was $57.4 billion at the end of the year. In the fourth quarter, orders were particularly strong for combat vehicle production and improvements, both domestically and internationally. Gulfstream also enjoyed healthy demand across its product portfolio in the quarter, and for the full year recorded the highest number of orders for new aircraft since the introduction of the G650 in 2008.
Estimated potential contract value, representing management's estimate of the value of unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised contract options, increased to $28 billion at year-end 2011. Total potential contract value, the sum of all backlog components, was $85.4 billion at the end of the year.
