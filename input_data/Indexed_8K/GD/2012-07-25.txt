General Dynamics Reports Second-Quarter 2012 Results
 
  General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported second-quarter 2012 earnings from continuing operations of $634 million, or $1.77 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared with 2011 second-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $666 million, or $1.79 per share fully diluted. Revenues in the quarter were $7.9 billion. Net earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $634 million, compared to $653 million in the second quarter of 2011.
FALLS CHURCH, Va.
Margins
Company-wide operating margins for the second quarter of 2012 were 12.2 percent, which reflected 90-basis-point increases in each of the Aerospace, Combat Systems and Marine Systems groups over the year-ago period. Operating margins in the Information Systems and Technology group were 8.9 percent.
Cash
Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter totaled $789 million. Free cash flow from operations, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $703 million in second-quarter 2012, or approximately 111 percent of earnings from continuing operations.
Backlog
Funded backlog declined slightly in the second quarter, compared to first-quarter 2012. However, demand for information technology (IT) services was strong in the quarter, and other significant awards received included an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract from the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control radios which has a maximum potential value of $365 million over 10 years; a $270 million order for Hydra-70 rockets in support of Army requirements; $115 million for conversion of additional Stryker vehicles to the new double-V-hulled configuration and contractor logistics support; and a $125 million contract for continued development of the U.S. Navy's next-generation ballistic-missile submarine (SSBN(X)).
 
The company's total backlog at the end of second-quarter 2012 was $52.4 billion, and the estimated potential contract value was an additional $26.2 billion, representing management's estimate of value under unfunded IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. The sum of all backlog components exceeded $78 billion at the end of the quarter.
"General Dynamics' operating results in the second quarter reflect our continued focus on disciplined execution and effective cash conversion across the corporation," said Jay L. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer.
"Heading into the second half of 2012, I remain very confident in our continued ability to execute. However, given the impact of first-half award delays in IS&T's tactical communications business, as well as the likelihood of further delays in the second half, I believe it is prudent to revise the full-year earnings guidance range downward to $7.00 to $7.10 per share, fully diluted."
General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, employs approximately 93,500 people worldwide. The company is a market leader in business aviation; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and information systems and technologies.
