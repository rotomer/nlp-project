    FAIRFIELD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 12, 2002--GE's second-quarter 2002 earnings grew 14% over second quarter 2001 to $4.4 billion, or $.44 per share, the highest of any quarter in the Company's history, GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt announced today.     "In a tough environment, GE's businesses continue to win in their markets by bringing great technology and services to their customers," Immelt said.

Exhibit (99)
GE Grows Second-Quarter Earnings 14% To a Record $4.4 Billion, With Industrial Revenues Up 10%; Reconfirms Full-Year Target of $1.65-$1.67 Per Share
   "GE's diversified portfolio of leading businesses produced another quarter of double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow," Immelt said. "Our long-cycle industrial businesses and GE Capital's consumer and mid-market businesses continue to deliver. The improved performance we're seeing at our short-cycle businesses - particularly NBC, Plastics and Appliances - position us well for future quarters. The GE team continues to perform in a tough environment."
    Financial highlights include:
Earnings rose 14% to $4.426 billion from $3.897 billion in second quarter 2001, and earnings per share (EPS) increased 13% to $.44. Power Systems, NBC, Medical Systems, Appliances and eight GE Capital businesses had double-digit earnings growth. As previously disclosed, earnings reflect $358 million from a favorable settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of a dispute regarding exports from Aircraft Engines since 1979; a $70 million after-tax benefit from terminations of Power Systems gas turbine orders; approximately $350 million after taxes of adjustments for estimates of prior-year loss events at Employers Reinsurance Corporation (ERC), which resulted in a quarterly loss for ERC of $236 million; and a $110 million after-tax loss to recognize impairment of WorldCom bonds.
As required by new accounting rules, as of Jan. 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized. On a comparable basis, second quarter 2002 EPS would have increased 7%. Adjusting for goodwill and pension income, EPS would have been up 11%.
Revenues rose 4% over second quarter 2001 to $33.2 billion. Industrial revenues grew 10%, with double-digit growth at Power Systems as well as Medical Systems, Appliances and Specialty Materials. Revenues at GE Capital Services (GECS) declined 4% because of the revenue effects of the ERC and WorldCom items. GECS net revenues (revenues less interest costs) from financing and operating activities grew 12%.  
Cash generated from GE's operating activities, excluding progress collections, was a record $6.1 billion in the first half of 2002, up 12% from $5.4 billion last year. Reported cash flow from operations was $3.5 billion, which, reflecting the record progress collections in 2001, was 55% lower than last year's reported $7.8 billion. GE returned $4.7 billion to shareowners in the first half of 2002 through $3.6 billion in dividends and $1.1 billion in share repurchases.  
Operating margin was 21.2%, up from last year's 20.6%, reflecting GE's continuing productivity gains.  
GE Capital Services (GECS) second-quarter earnings were $1.327 billion, down 10% from last year's $1.477 billion as a result of losses at ERC and the WorldCom bond impairment. Excluding ERC and the WorldCom item, and putting goodwill on a comparable basis, GECS earnings grew 14%, with particularly strong results from its Mid-Market Financing businesses and Global Consumer Finance. GECS assets totaled $461 billion at the end of the quarter, up 22% from $376 billion at the end of second quarter 2001.
    GE will provide more detail on second-quarter results on a conference call and Webcast to be held at 9 a.m. EDT today. Call information and related charts are available at www.ge.com/investor.     Among second-quarter business highlights:
GE Power Systems (GEPS) shipped 109 heavy-duty gas turbines in the quarter, including 86 from its Greenville, South Carolina facility. GEPS Energy Services added 25 new contractual services agreements valued at $1.1 billion. Commitments through the first half of the year reached $26.1 billion, $6.5 billion or 33 percent more since second quarter of last year. During the quarter GEPS also completed the acquisition of the manufacturing and technology assets of Enron Wind Corp., establishing GE Wind Energy as a leading presence in the renewable energy industry, which is growing at nearly 20% a year.  
GE Medical Systems (GEMS) total orders of $1.8 billion increased 18%, with double-digit growth in most modalities, and healthcare services orders grew 17%. Strong customer demand for GEMS new EXCITE magnetic resonance (MR) technology resulted in more than $350 million in MR orders, a 21% increase. Ultrasound orders grew 19% to almost $200 million, driven in part by the success of the new Voluson(TM) 730 4D Ultrasound System. Orders for PET (positron emission tomography) systems increased 87% and totaled nearly $100 million, driven by growing support for the clinical value of GE's Discovery(TM) LS system, a combined PET/CT (computed tomography) system focused on cancer diagnosis and treatment. Orders for healthcare information technology (IT) systems grew 36% to more than $340 million, including an increase of more than 100% for GE's image archiving systems and a 55% increase in patient monitoring and clinical information systems. During the quarter GEMS launched the Lightspeed16, its breakthrough 16-slice CT scanner, and generated more than 50 orders worldwide.  
GE Aircraft Engines (GEAE) and CFMI, GEAE's joint venture with Snecma, won $1.4 billion in commercial engine orders during the second quarter, including orders from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. GEAE achieved a significant milestone during the quarter with certification of its CF34 family of regional jet engines by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Regional jets constitute the fastest-growing sector of commercial aviation, and to date GEAE has received more than $7 billion in firm and option orders for its CF34 engines. During the quarter, GE Engines Services completed the acquisition of Unison Industries Inc, a global leader in ignition systems for aerospace applications. GE Engine Services' backlog in multi-year service agreements now exceeds $26 billion. GEAE received more than $600 million in military contracts during the quarter, including the Air Force of the Republic of Korea's selection of GEAE's F110 engine to power 40 new Boeing F-15K aircraft. The order, valued at more than $340 million, launches the F110 engine on the twin-engine F-15 aircraft. GEAE's widely-used F404 fighter engine was selected by The Boeing Company to power the Defense Advanced Research Agency/US Air Force X-45B Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) currently under development.  
GE Capital Services (GECS) launched Healthcare Financial Services (HFS) in the quarter, building on assets acquired in the Heller Financial transaction to create one of the largest businesses providing capital, financial solutions and related services to the healthcare industry. HFS serves a growing global healthcare market that it estimates is more than $4 trillion. During the quarter, Real Estate completed its acquisition of Security Capital Group Inc., providing it with positions in self-storage, grocery-anchored retail and parking. GECS acquired AGC Limited from Westpac, expanding the platforms of Global Consumer Finance and Commercial Equipment Finance.  
NBC continued its success in television's most sought-after demographic, adults 18-49, with seven of the quarter's 10 highest-rated prime-time programs. The network claimed its ninth consecutive sweeps victory in May with a 37% advantage over its nearest competitor. Overall, NBC led in key demographics for the quarter in morning news, daytime, evening news, late night and Sunday morning public affairs programming. With this ratings success, NBC garnered 52% of the growth in advertising industry dollars in May's upfront sales season, reaching $2.7 billion at prices 7% higher than last year. NBC also saw increases in scatter pricing, which at the end of the quarter was 7% higher than upfront pricing. During the quarter, NBC completed the Telemundo and KNTV acquisitions.  
GE Appliances (GEA) grew quarterly revenues 14% and operating profit 28% as new products continued to drive share gains and increase profitability. The GE Profile Advantium(TM) 120 won a Gold Medal Award for design from the Industrial Designers Society of America and Business Week, and the GE Profile(TM) and Triton XL(TM) dishwashers were recognized by Design Journal. The GE Profile Arctica(TM) also won the 2002 Kitchen & Bath Award at the Kitchen & Bath Industry annual show. During the quarter, GEA introduced its exclusive Precise Air(TM) convection system, with reversing airflow that cooks more evenly, and a new line of GE Profile products with dramatically contoured styling.  
GE Plastics (GEP) order volume for core products grew 25% over second quarter 2001, although global price pressures continued and held the increase in the monetary value of those orders to 15%. Order backlog quantities increased for the second consecutive quarter, and were 9% higher at the end of second quarter than at the end of first quarter. China remains a key growth region for GEP, and during the quarter the business announced plans to move its Pacific headquarters from Tokyo to Shanghai.
