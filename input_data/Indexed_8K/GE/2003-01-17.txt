NEWS RELEASE
General Electric Company
-- GE achieved a record $15.1 billion in earnings in 2002, a 7% increase over 2001, and, excluding progress collections, generated $15.2 billion in cash from operating activities, up 10%, the Company announced today.
Fairfield, Conn., January 17, 2003
"GE delivered solid results in a very challenging economy, with excellent performances by several businesses and one major disappointment," said GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. "Power Systems, NBC, Commercial Finance, Consumer Finance, and Medical Systems all had record years. We also had remarkable performances by Aircraft Engines and Aviation Services, our aircraft leasing business, in the worst year for aviation in recent memory. Our businesses posted impressive customer wins and continued to invest in technologies and services that will position them for long-term success. I'm proud of the performance of the GE team in such a tough environment.
"Our major disappointment was Employers Reinsurance Corporation (ERC)," Immelt said. "As we announced in November, poor underwriting in past years resulted in much higher losses for ERC, as well as the entire reinsurance industry. We have a strong team in place at ERC improving its operations and driving a return to profitability in 2003."
GE will provide more detail about results on a conference call and Webcast to be held at 8:30 a.m. EDT today. Call information and related charts are available at www.ge.com/investor.
Highlights of preliminary fourth-quarter and full-year 2002 results:
of $3.102 billion, or $.31 per share, reflect a previously announced charge for adverse development at ERC and decreased 21% from $3.933 billion, or $.39 per share, in fourth quarter 2001. Fourth quarter earnings also include the effects of a $514 million gain from NBC's exchange of certain assets for the cable network Bravo; during the quarter NBC and other industrial businesses recorded $301 million after tax of restructuring and other charges.
Fourth quarter earnings
were a record $35.4 billion, up 4% over last year's $34.0 billion. Industrial sales increased 8% over fourth quarter 2001, with product services growing 18% to $6.3 billion. Financial Services revenues were $15.5 billion, down 3% on lower interest rates, while net revenues (revenues less interest costs) at Commercial Finance, Consumer Finance and Equipment Management grew 17%.
Fourth quarter revenues
before required accounting changes grew 7% to a record $15.1 billion, or $1.51 per share, from last year's $14.1 billion, or $1.41 per share. Earnings after accounting changes, described below, were $14.1 billion, or $1.41 per share in 2002, compared with last year's $13.7 billion, or $1.37 per share.
Full-year 2002 earnings
generated from GE's operating activities in 2002, excluding progress collections, was $15.2 billion, up 10% from $13.8 billion last year. Reflecting lower progress collections from the record levels of last year, reported cash from operating activities decreased 41% to $10.1 billion from $17.2 billion in 2001.
Cash
of $131.7 billion increased 5% from $125.9 billion in 2001. Industrial sales increased 8% in 2002, with double-digit growth at Power Systems, NBC, Specialty Materials and Industrial Systems. Revenues at GE's financial services businesses were flat at $58.2 billion on lower interest rates, while net revenues at Commercial Finance, Consumer Finance and Equipment Management grew 15%.
Consolidated 2002 revenues
for 2002 was 19.1%, down from last year's record 19.6%, reflecting the effects of the Winter Olympics, fourth-quarter 2002 restructuring and other charges, and continued pricing pressure at short-cycle businesses. Full-year pre-tax savings from digitization totaled $1.6 billion.
Operating margin
were required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the first quarters of 2002 and 2001. In first quarter 2002, GE recorded a non-cash transition charge to earnings of $1.015 billion, or $.10 per share, for impairment of goodwill as required for adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142 (SFAS 142). In the first quarter of 2001, GE recorded a one-time, non-cash transition charge of $444 million, or $.04 per share, as required for adoption of new accounting rules for derivatives, warrants, options and other financial instruments.   As required by SFAS 142, as of January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized. Without goodwill amortization in 2001, EPS in 2002 would have been the same as 2001. On the same basis, and without the fourth-quarter charge for ERC, EPS would have increased 9%.
Accounting changes
"GE businesses strengthened their leadership positions in 2002, and they are positioned for solid operating performance in 2003," Immelt said. "We expect to deliver earnings per share growth between 3% and 13%, with broad-based earnings growth at our businesses. Power Systems will experience the long-anticipated decline in U.S. gas turbine sales. However, Power's energy services, oil and gas, and renewable energy businesses will grow earnings in excess of 20%.
"This year we also achieved a number of strategic objectives that position GE for long-term growth," Immelt said. "We maintained our triple-A credit ratingsand strengthened our financial flexibility. We implemented a set of principles that position GE as a leader in governance and transparency. We have a full pipeline of new products and an $85 billion multi-year services backlog. We are growing revenues 40% a year in China. We are building new platforms in security, water technology, healthcare information technology, wind energy and Hispanic media. The GE we are building -- a technology, services and financial company -- will continue our record of superior long-term growth through the cycles."
