SCHEDULE I DEBT SECURITIES
GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY DEBT SECURITIES AND/OR WARRANTS TO PURCHASE DEBT SECURITIES UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT STANDARD PROVISIONS January 23, 2003 Ladies and Gentlemen: General Electric Company, a New York corporation (the "Company"), may from time to time enter into one or more underwriting agreements in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto (each an "Underwriting Agreement") that provide for the sale of certain of its securities specified in the particular Underwriting Agreement (the "Designated Securities"). The basic provisions set forth herein to the extent applicable to securities of the type represented by the Designated Securities will be incorporated by reference in any such Underwriting Agreement relating to a particular issue of Designated Securities. Each Underwriting Agreement will be entered into, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine and shall be specified in such Underwriting Agreement. The Underwriting Agreement may appoint a lead underwriter or underwriters (collectively, the "Representative") for the particular issue of Designated Securities and will specify the underwriters participating in such offering (the "Underwriters", which term shall include any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 9 hereof). The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Designated Securities and the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Designated Securities shall be evidenced by the Underwriting Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. The Underwriting Agreement, including the provisions incorporated therein by reference, is herein referred to as "this Agreement." The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement shall be several and not joint. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement are used herein as defined therein. The terms and rights of any particular issue of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Underwriting Agreement relating thereto and (i) if the Designated Securities are either senior or subordinated debt securities ("Debt Securities"), in or pursuant to the senior or subordinated indenture as applicable (the "Indenture") identified in the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) if the Designated Securities are warrants ("Warrants"), in or pursuant to a warrant agreement (the "Warrant Agreement") identified in the Underwriting Agreement and (iii) if the Designated Securities are debt securities subject to the warrants ("Warrant Debt Securities"), pursuant to the
Indenture identified in the Underwriting Agreement. An Underwriting Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. A registration statement in respect of the Designated Securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); the registration statement has been declared effective by the Commission and each Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement has been issued and no proceeding for the purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission. The Company proposes to file pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Designated Securities and has previously advised the Underwriters of all information to be set forth therein. The term "Registration Statement" means the registration statement as amended to the date of this Agreement, including the information, if any, deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 434(d) under the rules and regulations of the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations") and any related Registration Statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations. The term "Basic Prospectus" means the prospectus included in the Registration Statement. The term "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus together with the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Designated Securities, as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 (the "Prospectus Supplement"); provided, however, that if the Company elects to rely upon Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, then all references to the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to the Basic Prospectus and the term sheet relating to the Designated Securities in the form furnished to the Underwriters by the Company in reliance upon Rule 434. The term "Preliminary Prospectus" means a preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Designated Securities together with the Basic Prospectus. All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus, as the case may be, prior to the execution of the applicable Underwriting Agreement; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act") which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus, as the case may be, after the execution of the applicable Underwriting Agreement. SECTION 1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY. The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter named in the applicable Underwriting Agreement, as of the date thereof and as of the Closing Time (as defined below) as follows: (1) each document filed by the Company pursuant to the 1934 Act which is incorporated by reference in the Prospectus complied when so filed in all material 2
respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and each document, if any, hereafter filed by the Company and so incorporated by reference in the Prospectus will comply when so filed with the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; (2) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply, and the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (and any amendments and supplements thereto, other than supplements relating only to securities, other than the Designated Securities) will as of the Closing Time comply, in all material respects with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations. (3) each Preliminary Prospectus, if any, relating to the Designated Securities filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act complied when so filed in all material respects with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations; and (4) each part of the Registration Statement at the time such part became effective did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Prospectus as of the date of the prospectus supplement relating to the Designated Securities did not, and the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented, other than as to supplements relating only to securities other than the Designated Securities) as of the Closing Time will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; except that these representations and warranties do not apply to (i) statements or omissions in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to the foregoing, based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter expressly for use therein and (ii) any Form T-1 Statement of Eligibility and Qualification included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. SECTION 2. SALE AND DELIVERY; CLOSING. (a) DELAYED DELIVERY CONTRACTS. Pursuant to the applicable Underwriting Agreement, the Company will agree to sell to the several Underwriters named in Schedule I thereto and the Underwriters, upon the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the conditions hereinafter stated, will agree to purchase from the Company severally and not jointly, (i) the principal amounts of Debt Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I thereto, less their respective amounts of the Contract Debt Securities (as hereinafter defined), if any, determined as provided below, and/or (ii) Warrants to purchase the principal amounts of Warrant Debt Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I thereto, less their respective amounts of the Contract Warrants (as hereinafter defined), if any, determined as provided below, all at the respective purchase prices set forth in such Underwriting Agreement, plus accrued interest, if any, from the date set forth therein to the date of payment and delivery. Debt Securities and, if applicable, Warrants to be purchased pursuant to delayed delivery contracts are hereinafter referred to as "Contract Debt Securities" and "Contract Warrants", respectively, and collectively as the "Contract Securities". 3
If so indicated in the applicable Underwriting Agreement, the Company may authorize the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Contract Securities on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein pursuant to delayed delivery contracts substantially in the form of Exhibit D attached hereto but with such changes therein as the Company may authorize or approve (hereinafter referred to as "Delayed Delivery Contracts"). Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors approved by the Company and described in the Prospectus. The aggregate principal amount of Contract Debt Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Warrant Debt Securities for which Contract Warrants are exercisable shall not exceed the respective amounts set forth in Schedule I to the applicable Underwriting Agreement. As of the Closing Time, the Company will pay to the Representative as compensation, for the accounts of the Underwriters, the fee specified in the applicable Underwriting Agreement in respect of all Contract Securities. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. If the Designated Securities are Debt Securities, the deduction for the Contract Debt Securities referred to above shall become effective upon execution and delivery by the Company and the several institutional investors of the Delayed Delivery Contracts and such deduction for each Underwriter shall be in the amount which shall bear the same proportion to the total principal amount of Contract Debt Securities as the principal amount of Debt Securities set forth opposite the name of the respective Underwriter bears to the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities set forth in Schedule I to the applicable Underwriting Agreement, except to the extent that the Representative determines that such deduction shall be otherwise than in such proportions, and so advises the Company in writing. If the Designated Securities are Warrants and Debt Warrant Securities, the deduction for the Contract Warrants referred to above shall become effective upon execution and delivery by the Company and the several institutional investors of the Delayed Delivery Contracts and such deduction for each Underwriter shall be in the amount which shall bear the same proportion to the total principal amount of Debt Warrant Securities for which Contract Warrants are exercisable as the principal amount of Debt Warrant Securities for which Warrants are exercisable as set forth opposite the name of the respective Underwriter bears to the aggregate principal amount of Debt Warrant Securities for which Warrants are exercisable as set forth in Schedule I to the applicable Underwriting Agreement, except to the extent that the Representative determines that such deduction shall be otherwise than in such proportions, and so advises the Company in writing. (b) SALES TO UNDERWRITERS. The several commitments of the Underwriters to purchase the Designated Securities pursuant to the applicable Underwriting Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. (c) PAYMENT. Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement relating thereto, in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representative may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representative for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor in the funds and in the manner specified in such Underwriting 4
Agreement, all at the place and time and date specified in such Underwriting Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the Representative and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "Closing Time" for such Designated Securities. Concurrently with the delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities, the Company will deliver to the Representative for the accounts of the Underwriters a check payable or wire transfer to the order of the party designated in the Underwriting Agreement relating to such securities in the amount of any compensation payable by the Company to the Underwriters in respect of any Delayed Deliver Contracts as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2 and in the Underwriting Agreement related to such securities. SECTION 3. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. The Company covenants with each Underwriter of the Designated Securities as follows: (a) COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES REGULATIONS AND COMMISSION REQUESTS. The Company will comply in respect of the Designated Securities with the requirements of the 1933 Act Regulations, as applicable, and will promptly effect the filings necessary pursuant to Rule 424 and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the Prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424 was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file the Prospectus. (b) DELIVERY OF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS AND PROSPECTUSES. The Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Time and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus relating to the Designated Securities and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representative may reasonably request. (c) CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS. If at any time when the Prospectus relating to the Designated Securities is required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Designated Securities, any event shall occur as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of such counsel, at any such time to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to make the Prospectus comply with such requirements, and the Company will furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment or supplement as the Underwriters may reasonably request. (d) BLUE SKY QUALIFICATIONS. The Company will use its best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Designated Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may reasonably request; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that 5
the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction. (e) EARNINGS STATEMENT. The Company will make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the date of each Underwriting Agreement, an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations. SECTION 4. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES. The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Underwriting Agreement, including (i) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits) as originally filed and of each amendment thereto, (ii) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel, accountants and other advisors or agents (including transfer agents and registrars), as well as the fees and disbursements of the Trustees and any warrant agent, and their respective counsel, (iii) the qualification of the Designated Securities under state securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(d) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation, printing and delivery of the Blue Sky Survey, and any amendment thereto, (iv) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of each preliminary prospectus, any term sheet, and the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, (v) the fees charged by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations for the rating of the Designated Securities and (vi) the fees and expenses incurred with respect to the listing of the Designated Securities. SECTION 5. CONDITIONS OF UNDERWRITERS' OBLIGATIONS. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Designated Securities pursuant to the applicable Underwriting Agreement are subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 1 hereof or in certificates of any officer of the Company delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and to the following further conditions: (a) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall be in effect, and no proceedings for such purpose shall be pending before or threatened by the Commission, and there shall have been no material adverse change (not in the ordinary course of business) in the condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Prospectus; and the Representative shall have received at the Closing Time a certificate of the Company, dated the date of Closing Time and signed by an officer of the Company, to the foregoing effect. The officer making such certificate may rely upon the best of his knowledge as to proceedings pending or threatened. (b) At Closing Time, the Representative shall have received the opinion, dated such date, of Robert E. Healing, corporate counsel, relating to the Designated Securities, to the effect set forth in Exhibit B hereto. 6
(c) At Closing Time, the Representative shall have received the opinion, dated such date, of Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Company, relating to the Designated Securities, to the effect set forth in Exhibit C hereto. (d) At Closing Time, the Representative shall have received the opinion, dated such date, of counsel for the Underwriters, relating to the Designated Securities and such other matters as the Representative may reasonably request. (e) At Closing Time, the Representative shall have received from KPMG LLP a letter dated such date containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Registration Statement and Prospectus. SECTION 6. (a) INDEMNIFICATION. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (if used within the period set forth in paragraph (c) of Section 3 hereof and as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for the use therein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing indemnity with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus or any Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any losses, claims, damages or liabilities otherwise covered by this paragraph purchased Designated Securities, or to the benefit of any person controlling such Underwriter, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended and supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of Designated Securities to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability. Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto. Promptly after receipt by any person of notice of any claim or the institution of any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent 7
that it elects (upon notice to the indemnified party), jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party shall not have so elected to assume such defense, then, upon request of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. If the indemnifying party shall so elect to assume such defense, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party pursuant to this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties. Anything hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding, any reference in this Section 6 to counsel reasonably satisfactory to , or designated by, the indemnified party shall mean (i) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory, or designated by, the Representative on behalf of all parties so indemnified pursuant to such paragraph and (ii) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph, counsel reasonable satisfactory, or designated by, the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgement for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (b) CONTRIBUTION. If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of Section 6 is unavailable as a matter of law to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) if the indemnifying party is the Company, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefit received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities, (ii) if an Underwriter is the indemnifying party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the Underwriter's relative fault on the one hand and that of the Company on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or (iii) if the allocation provided by claims (i) or clause (ii) above, as the case may be, is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefit referred to in clause (i) above or the relative fault referred to in clause (ii) above, as the case may be, but also such relative fault (in cases covered by clause (i)) or such relative benefit (in cases covered by clause (ii)) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total 8
net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omissions. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this paragraph were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations provided for, in the respective cases, in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provision of this paragraph (b) concerning contribution, no indemnifying party shall be required to make contribution in any circumstances in which such party would not have been required to provide indemnification by the terms of paragraph (a). Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by an indemnified party of such party's rights, if any, to receive contribution pursuant to Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act or other applicable law. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this section are several, in proportion to the respective amounts of Designated Securities underwritten by each of such Underwriters, and not joint. In the event that the indemnifying party is one or more of the Underwriters, then the Representative shall act on behalf of the indemnifying party with respect to receipt of notice, agreement as to retention of separate counsel and consent to settlement, and the indemnified party may rely upon the action of the Representative as binding upon each such indemnifying party for purposes of this section. 9
SECTION 7. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities. The provisions of Section 6 shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. SECTION 8. TERMINATION.

SECTION 2.03. The Securities shall be issuable as registered Securities and in the denominations of $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof, subject to Sections 2.01(xi) and (xiv).

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01, the principal of and the interest on the Securities of any series, as well as any premium thereon in case of redemption thereof prior to maturity, shall be payable in Dollars at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose.

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01, interest on Securities will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Any interest on any Security which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of the same series (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered holder on the relevant regular record date by virtue of having been such holder; and such Defaulted Interest shall be paid by the Company, at its election, as provided in clause (1) or clause (2) below: (1) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on Securities to the persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner: the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such 13
Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall not be more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such special record date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Securityholder at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register (as hereinafter defined), not less than 10 days prior to such special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered on such special record date and shall be no longer payable pursuant to the following clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on any Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Unless otherwise set forth in a Company Order or one or more indentures supplemental hereto establishing the terms of any series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof, the term "regular record date" as used in this Section with respect to a series of Securities with respect to any Interest Payment Date for such series shall mean either the fifteenth day of the month immediately preceding the month in which an Interest Payment Date established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof shall occur, if such Interest Payment Date is the first day of a month, or the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which an Interest Payment Date established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof shall occur, if such Interest Payment Date is the fifteenth day of a month, whether or not such 14
date is a Business Day. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security of a series delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security of such series shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. SECTION 2.04. The Securities shall, subject to the provisions of Section 2.06, be printed on steel engraved borders or fully or partially engraved, or legibly typed, as the proper officer of the Company may determine, and shall be signed on behalf of the Company by an Authorized Officer. The signature of such Authorized Officer upon the Securities may be in the form of a facsimile signature of a present or any future Authorized Officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities and for that purpose the Company may use the facsimile signature of any person who shall have been an Authorized Officer, notwithstanding the fact that at the time the Securities shall be authenticated and delivered or disposed of such person shall have ceased to be an Authorized Officer. Only such Securities as shall bear thereon a Certificate of Authentication substantially in the form established for such Securities, executed manually by an authorized signatory of the Trustee, or by any Authenticating Agent with respect to such Securities, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate executed by the Trustee, or by any Authenticating Agent appointed by the Trustee with respect to such Securities, upon any Security executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the registered holder thereof is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities and the Trustee, in accordance with such Company Order, shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; provided, however, that in the case of Securities offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Securities from time to time in accordance with Instructions or such other procedures acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified by or pursuant to a supplemental indenture or Company Order delivered to the Trustee prior to the time of the 15
first authentication of Securities of such series. In authenticating such Securities and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall receive and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, (i) an Opinion of Counsel and (ii) an Officers' Certificate, each stating that the form and terms thereof have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; provided, however, that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive such Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate only once at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series and that, in such opinion or certificate, the opinion or certificate described above may state that when the terms of such Securities, or each Tranche thereof, shall have been established pursuant to a Company Order or Orders or pursuant to such procedures acceptable to the Trustee, as may be specified by a Company Order, such terms will have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture. Each Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall include all statements prescribed in Section 13.06(b). Such Opinion of Counsel shall also be to the effect that when such Securities have been executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and delivered to and duly paid for by the purchasers thereof, they will be valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms (subject to customary exceptions) and will be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. With respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Securities, the forms and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Company Order, Opinion of Counsel, Officers' Certificate and other documents delivered pursuant to this Section at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series unless and until such Company Order, Opinion of Counsel, Officers' Certificate or other documents have been superseded or revoked or expire by their terms. The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. 16
SECTION 2.05. (a) Securities of any series may be exchanged upon presentation thereof at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose, for other Securities of such series of authorized denominations, and for a like aggregate principal amount, upon payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge in relation thereto, all as provided in this Section. In respect of any Securities so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in exchange therefor the Security or Securities of the same series which the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive, bearing numbers not contemporaneously outstanding. (b) The Company shall keep, or cause to be kept, at its office or agency designated for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, or such other location designated by the Company a register or registers (herein referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall register the Securities and the transfers of Securities as in this Article provided and which at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the Trustee. The registrar for the purpose of registering Securities and transfer of Securities as herein provided shall be appointed as authorized by Board Resolution, an indenture supplement hereto or Company Order (the "Security Registrar"). Upon surrender for transfer of any Security at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, or other location as aforesaid, the Company shall execute, the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series as the Security presented for a like aggregate principal amount. All Securities presented or surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer, as provided in this Section, shall be accompanied (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security Registrar, duly executed by the registered holder or by his duly authorized attorney in writing. (c) Except as provided in the first paragraph of Section 2.07, no service charge shall be made for any exchange or 17
registration of transfer of Securities, or issue of new Securities in case of partial redemption of any series, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge in relation thereto, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.06, Section 3.03(b) and Section 9.04 not involving any transfer. (d) The Company shall neither be required (i) to issue, exchange or register the transfer of any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of less than all the outstanding Securities of the same series and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, nor (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of any series or portions thereof called for redemption or as to which the holder thereof has exercised its right, if any, to require the Company to repurchase such Security in whole or in part, except that portion of such Security not required to be repurchased. The provisions of this Section 2.05 are, with respect to any Global Security, subject to Section 2.11 hereof. SECTION 2.06. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities (printed, lithographed or typewritten) of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Every temporary Security of any series shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities of such series in accordance with Section 2.04. Without unnecessary delay the Company will execute and will furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon any or all temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor (without charge to the holders thereof), at the office or agency of the Company designated for the purpose, and the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of such series, unless the Company advises the Trustee to the effect that definitive Securities need not be executed and furnished until further notice from the Company. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of such series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series authenticated and delivered hereunder. 18
SECTION 2.07. In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company (subject to the next succeeding sentence) shall execute, and upon its request the Trustee (subject as aforesaid) shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the same series bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Security shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of the applicant's Security and of the ownership thereof. The Trustee may authenticate any such substituted Security and deliver the same upon the written request or authorization of any officer of the Company. Upon the issuance of any substituted Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as they may require to save them harmless, and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof. Every Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section in substitution for any Security which is mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, or be enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities, and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies, notwithstanding any 19
law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender. SECTION 2.08. All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, exchange or registration of transfer, or for credit against a sinking fund, shall, if surrendered to the Company or any paying agent, be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be canceled by it, and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly required or permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. On request of the Company, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company canceled Securities held by the Trustee. In the absence of such request the Trustee may dispose of canceled Securities in accordance with its standard procedures. If the Company shall otherwise acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. SECTION 2.09. Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and the holders of the Securities, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Indenture, or under any covenant, condition or provision herein contained; all such covenants, conditions and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and of the holders of the Securities. SECTION 2.10. So long as any of the Securities of any series remain outstanding there may be an Authenticating Agent for any or all such series of Securities which the Trustee shall have the right to appoint. Said Authenticating Agent shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, transfer or partial redemption thereof, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. All references in this Indenture to the authentication of Securities by the Trustee shall be deemed to include authentication by an Authenticating Agent for such series except for authentication upon original issuance or pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall be a corporation which has a combined capital and surplus, as most recently reported or determined by it, sufficient under the laws of any jurisdiction under which it is organized or in which it is doing business to conduct a trust 20
business, and which is otherwise authorized under such laws to conduct such business and is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authorities. If at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with these provisions it shall resign immediately. Any Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time (and upon request by the Company shall) terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon resignation, termination or cessation of eligibility of any Authenticating Agent, the Trustee may appoint an eligible successor Authenticating Agent acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent pursuant hereto. The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section. SECTION 2.11. (a) If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 2.01 that the Securities of a particular series are to be issued as a Global Security, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 2.04, authenticate and deliver, a Global Security which (i) shall represent, and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of, all of the Outstanding Securities of such series, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, (iii) shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee to the Depository or pursuant to the Depository's instruction and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.11 of the Indenture, this Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depository or to a successor Depository or to a nominee of such successor Depository." (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05, the Global Security of a series may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 2.05, only to another nominee of the Depository for such series, or to a successor Depository for such series selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depository. (c) If at any time the Depository for a series of Securities notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for such series or if at any time the Depository for 21
such series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation and a successor Depository for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, this Section 2.11 shall no longer be applicable to the Securities of such series and the Company will execute, and subject to Section 2.05, the Trustee will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in exchange for such Global Security. In addition, the Company may at any time determine that the Securities of any series shall no longer be represented by a Global Security and that the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall no longer apply to the Securities of such series. In such event the Company will execute, and subject to Section 2.05, the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate evidencing such determination by the Company, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in exchange for such Global Security. Upon the exchange of the Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee. Such Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.11(c) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depository, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Security Registrar. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Depository for delivery to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered. SECTION 2.12. In the case of the Securities of any series denominated in any currency other than Dollars or in a composite currency (the "Required Currency"), except as otherwise specified with respect to such Securities as contemplated by Section 2.01, the obligation of the Company to make any payment of the principal thereof, or the premium or interest thereon, shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender by the Company, or recovery by the Trustee, in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the Trustee timely holding the full amount of the Required Currency then due and payable. If any such tender or recovery is in a currency other than the Required Currency, the Trustee may take such actions as it considers appropriate to exchange such 22
currency for the Required Currency. The costs and risks of any such exchange, including, without limitation, the risks of delay and exchange rate fluctuation, shall be borne by the Company, the Company shall remain fully liable for any shortfall or delinquency in the full amount of Required Currency then due and payable, and in no circumstances shall the Trustee be liable therefor except in the case of its negligence or willful misconduct. SECTION 2.13. The Company in issuing Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so used, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to holders of Securities; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or contained in any notice of redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers. ARTICLE THREE REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES AND SINKING FUND PROVISIONS SECTION 3.01. The Company may redeem the Securities of any series issued hereunder on and after the dates and in accordance with the terms established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof. SECTION 3.02. (a) In case the Company shall desire to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Securities of any series in accordance with the right reserved so to do, it shall give notice of such redemption to holders of the Securities of such series to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption of that series to such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder receives the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Security of any series designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Securities of such series or any other series. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption or subject to 23
compliance with certain conditions provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with any such restriction or condition. Unless otherwise so provided as to a particular series of Securities, if at the time of mailing of any notice of redemption the Company shall not have deposited with the paying agent an amount in cash sufficient to redeem all of the Securities called for redemption, including accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, such notice shall state that it is subject to the receipt of redemption moneys by the paying agent on or before the date fixed for redemption (unless such redemption is mandatory) and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so received on or before such date. Each such notice of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers, if any), specify the date fixed for redemption and the redemption price at which Securities of that series are to be redeemed, and shall state that payment of the redemption price of such Securities to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company, upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice, that from and after said date interest will cease to accrue and that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of Securities of that series to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Securities to be so redeemed. In case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice which relates to such Security shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued. (b) The Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days' notice in advance of the date fixed for redemption (unless the Trustee shall agree to a shorter period) and, in the case of redemption of less than all the Securities of a series, as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the series to be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair in its discretion and which may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof, subject to Sections 2.01(xi) and (xiv)) of the principal amount of 24
such Securities of a denomination larger than $1,000 (subject as aforesaid), the Securities to be redeemed and shall thereafter promptly notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Securities to be redeemed, in whole or in part. The Company may, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of instructions signed on its behalf by an Authorized Officer, instruct the Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Securities of a particular series for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth in this Section, such notice to be in the name of the Company or its own name as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions of this Section. SECTION 3.03. (a) If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with, subject to the Company Order or supplemental indenture hereto establishing the terms of such series of Securities, interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption and interest on such Securities or portions of Securities shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest with respect to any such Security or portion thereof. On presentation and surrender of such Securities on or after the date fixed for redemption at the place of payment specified in the notice, said Securities shall be paid and redeemed at the applicable redemption price for such series, together with, subject to the Company Order or supplemental indenture hereto establishing the terms of such series of Securities, interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. (b) Upon presentation of any Security of such series which is to be redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and the office or agency where the Security is presented shall deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same 25
series, of authorized denominations in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented. SECTION 3.04. The provisions of this Section 3.04 and Sections 3.05 and 3.06 shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Securities of such series. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 3.05. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of such series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series. SECTION 3.05. The Company (i) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (ii) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment; provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the mandatory sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. SECTION 3.06. Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.05 and the basis for such credit and will, together with such Officers' Certificate, deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.02 and cause 26
notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.02, except that the notice of redemption shall also state that the Securities of such series are being redeemed by operation of the sinking fund and the sinking fund payment date. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.03. ARTICLE FOUR PARTICULAR COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY The Company covenants and agrees for each series of the Securities as follows: SECTION 4.01. The Company will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities of that series at the time and place and in the manner provided herein and established with respect to such Securities. SECTION 4.02. So long as any series of the Securities remain outstanding, the Company agrees to maintain an office or agency with respect to each such series, which shall be in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York or at such other location or locations as may be designated as provided in this Section 4.02, where (i) Securities of that series may be presented for payment, (ii) Securities of that series may be presented as hereinabove authorized for registration of transfer and exchange, and (iii) notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be given or served, such designation to continue with respect to such office or agency until the Company shall, by written notice signed by an Authorized Officer and delivered to the Trustee, designate some other office or agency for such purposes or any of them. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, notices and demands. The Trustee will initially act as paying agent for the Securities. The Company may also from time to time, by written notice signed by an Authorized Officer and delivered to the Trustee, designate one or more other offices or agencies for the foregoing purposes within or outside the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, 27
and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligations to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York for the foregoing purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. SECTION 4.03. (a) If the Company shall appoint one or more paying agents for all or any series of the Securities, other than the Trustee, the Company will cause each such paying agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section: (1) that it will hold all sums held by it as such agent for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that series (whether such sums have been paid to it by the Company or by any other obligor of such Securities) in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto; (2) that it will give the Trustee prompt notice of any failure by the Company (or by any other obligor of such Securities) to make any payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that series when the same shall be due and payable; (3) that it will, at any time during the continuance of any failure referred to in the preceding paragraph (a)(2) above, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such paying agent; and (4) that it will perform all other duties of paying agent as set forth in this Indenture. (b) If the Company shall act as its own paying agent with respect to any series of the Securities, it will on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on Securities of that series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay such principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due on Securities of that series until such sums shall be paid to such persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of such action, or any failure (by it or any other obligor on such Securities) to take 28
such action. Whenever the Company shall have one or more paying agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with the paying agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such paying agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. (c) Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the agreement to hold sums in trust as provided in this Section is subject to the provisions of Section 11.04, and (ii) the Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or direct any paying agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such paying agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same terms and conditions as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such paying agent; and, upon such payment by any paying agent to the Trustee, such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money. SECTION 4.04. The Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 7.10, a Trustee, so that there shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder. SECTION 4.05. The Company will not, while any of the Securities remain outstanding, consolidate with, or merge into, or merge into itself, or sell or convey all or substantially all of its property to any other Person unless the provisions of Article Ten hereof are complied with. SECTION 4.06. In the event that the Company issues a Discount Security, the Company shall file with the Trustee at or prior to the time of the authentication of such Discount Security a written notice, in such form as mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Trustee, specifying the amount of original issue discount that will be accrued on such Discount Security in each calendar year from the date of issuance to the maturity thereof. 29
ARTICLE FIVE SECURITYHOLDERS' LISTS AND REPORTS BY THE COMPANY AND THE TRUSTEE SECTION 5.01. The Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee (a) on each regular record date (as defined in Section 2.03) for the Securities of each Tranche of a series a list, in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the holders of such Tranche of Securities as of such regular record date, provided, that the Company shall not be obligated to furnish or cause to be furnished such list at any time that the list shall not differ in any respect from the most recent list furnished to the Trustee by the Company and (b) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished; provided, however, no such list need be furnished for any series for which the Trustee shall be the Security Registrar. SECTION 5.02. (a) The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all information as to the names and addresses of the holders of Securities contained in the most recent list furnished to it as provided in Section 5.01 and as to the names and addresses of holders of Securities received by the Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar (if acting in such capacity). (b) The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 5.01 upon receipt of a new list so furnished. (c) In case three or more holders of Securities of a series (hereinafter referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee, and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Security for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other holders of Securities of such series or holders of all Securities with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under such Securities, and is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, at its election, either: (1) afford to such applicants access to the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 5.02; or 30
(2) inform such applicants as to the approximate number of holders of Securities of such series or of all Securities, as the case may be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 5.02, and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Securityholders the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such application. (d) If the Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to such information, the Trustee shall, upon the written request of such applicants, mail to each holder of such series or of all Securities, as the case may be, whose name and address appears in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 5.02, a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within five days after such tender, the Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the holders of Securities of such series or of all Securities, as the case may be, or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have been met and shall enter an order so declaring, the Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Securityholders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise, the Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application. (e) Each and every holder of the Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the holders of Securities in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this Section, regardless of the source from 31
which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under said subsection (c). SECTION 5.03. (a) The Company covenants and agrees to file with the Trustee, within 30 days after the Company is required to file the same with the Commission, a copy of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or a copy of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company may be required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act; or, if the Company is not required to file information, documents or reports pursuant to either of such sections, then to file with the Trustee and, unless the Commission shall not accept such information, documents or reports, the Commission, in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports which may be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act, in respect of a security listed and registered on a national securities exchange as may be prescribed from time to time in such rules and regulations. (b) The Company covenants and agrees to file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such additional information, documents and reports with respect to compliance by the Company with the conditions and covenants provided for in this Indenture as may be required from time to time by such rules and regulations. (c) The Company covenants and agrees to transmit by mail, first class postage prepaid, or reputable over-night delivery service which provides for evidence of receipt, to the Securityholders, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register, within 30 days after the filing thereof with the Trustee, such summaries of any information, documents and reports required to be filed by the Company pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this Section as may be required by rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission. (d) The Company covenants and agrees to furnish to the Trustee, on or before May 15 in each calendar year in which any of the Securities are outstanding, or on or before such other day in each calendar year as the Company and the Trustee may from time to time agree upon, a certificate from the principal executive 32
officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, as to his or her knowledge, of the Company's compliance with all conditions and covenants under this Indenture. For purposes of this subsection (d), such compliance shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided under this Indenture. (e) Delivery of such information, documents or reports to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.03(a) or 5.03(b) is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt thereof shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including, in the case of Section 5.03(b), the Company's compliance with any of the covenants hereunder. SECTION 5.04. (a) The Trustee shall transmit to Holders such reports concerning the Trustee and its actions under this Indenture as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner provided pursuant thereto. If required by Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall, within 60 days after each September 15th following the date of this Indenture deliver to Holders a brief report, dated as of such September 15th, which complies with the provisions of such Section 313(a). (b) A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Trustee with each stock exchange, if any, upon which the Securities are listed, with the Commission and with the Company. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee when the Securities are listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof. ARTICLE SIX REMEDIES OF THE TRUSTEE AND SECURITYHOLDERS ON EVENT OF DEFAULT SECTION 6.01. (a) Whenever used herein with respect to Securities of a particular series, "Event of Default" means any one or more of the following events which has occurred and is continuing: (1) default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the Securities of that series, as and when the same shall become due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days (subject to the deferral of any due date in the case of an extension period); 33
(2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any of the Securities of that series as and when the same shall become due and payable whether at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration or otherwise; (3) default in the making or satisfaction of any sinking fund payment or analogous obligation as and when the same shall become due and payable by the terms of the Securities of that series, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; (4) failure on the part of the Company duly to observe or perform any other of the covenants or agreements on the part of the Company with respect to that series contained in such Securities or otherwise established with respect to that series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof or contained in this Indenture (other than a covenant or agreement which has been expressly included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Securities other than such series) for a period of 90 days after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder, shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee, by registered or certified mail, or to the Company and the Trustee by the holders of at least twenty-five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series at the time outstanding; (5) a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall have been entered adjudging the Company as bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking liquidation or reorganization of the Company under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other similar applicable Federal or State law, and such decree or order shall have continued unvacated and unstayed for a period of 90 consecutive days; or an involuntary case shall be commenced under such Code in respect of the Company and shall continue undismissed for a period of 90 consecutive days or an order for relief in such case shall have been entered; or a decree or order of a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall have been entered for the appointment on the ground of insolvency or bankruptcy of a receiver or custodian or liquidator or trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company or of its property, or for the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and such decree or order shall have remained in force unvacated and unstayed for 34
a period of 90 consecutive days; (6) the Company shall institute proceedings to be adjudicated a voluntary bankrupt, or shall consent to the filing of a bankruptcy proceeding against it, or shall file a petition or answer or consent seeking liquidation or reorganization under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other similar applicable Federal or State law, or shall consent to the filing of any such petition, or shall consent to the appointment on the ground of insolvency or bankruptcy of a receiver or custodian or liquidator or trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of it or of its property, or shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (7) the occurrence of any other Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series, as contemplated by Section 2.01 hereof. (b) The Company shall file with the Trustee written notice of the occurrence of any Event of Default within five Business Days of the Company's becoming aware of any such Event of Default. In each and every such case, unless the principal of all the Securities of that series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than twenty-five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by such Securityholders), may declare the principal (or, if any of such Securities are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount thereof as may be specified by their terms as contemplated by Section 2.01) of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything contained in this Indenture or in the Securities of that series or established with respect to that series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof to the contrary notwithstanding. (c) Section 6.01(b), however, is subject to the condition that if, at any time after the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any and all Securities of that series which shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal 35
and premium, if any, and, to the extent that such payment is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate per annum expressed in the Securities of that series to the date of such payment or deposit) and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06, and any and all defaults under the Indenture, other than the nonpayment of principal on Securities of that series which shall not have become due by their terms, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 6.06, then and in every such case the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences with respect to that series of Securities; but no such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. (d) In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right with respect to Securities of that series under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken. SECTION 6.02. (a) The Company covenants that in case an Event of Default described in subsection 6.01(a)(1) or (a)(2) shall have occurred and be continuing, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of that series, the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on all such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) or interest, or both, as the case may be, with interest upon the overdue principal (and premium, if any) and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law and without duplication of any other amounts paid by the Company in respect thereof) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum expressed in the Securities of that series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06. (b) In case the Company shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to 36
institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or other obligor upon the Securities of that series and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or other obligor upon the Securities of that series wherever situated the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable. (c) In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or other judicial proceedings affecting the Company, any other obligor on such Securities, or the creditors or property of either, the Trustee shall have power to intervene in such proceedings and take any action therein that may be permitted by the court and shall (except as may be otherwise provided by law) be entitled to file such proofs of claim and other papers and documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and of the holders of Securities of such series allowed for the entire amount due and payable by the Company or such other obligor under this Indenture at the date of institution of such proceedings and for any additional amount which may become due and payable by the Company or such other obligor after such date, and to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and to distribute the same after the deduction of the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized by each of the holders of Securities of such series to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it under Section 7.06. (d) All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the terms established with respect to Securities of that series, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Securities, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for payment to the Trustee of any amounts due under Section 7.06, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series. In case of an Event of Default hereunder, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in 37
it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of that series or the rights of any holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding. SECTION 6.03. Any monies collected by the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.02 with respect to a particular series of Securities shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such monies on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the several Securities of that series, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of costs and expenses of collection and of all amounts payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06; SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon Securities of such series for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, respectively; and THIRD: To the Company. SECTION 6.04. No holder of any Security of any series shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the 38
continuance thereof with respect to Securities of such series specifying such Event of Default, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the holders of not less than twenty-five percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have failed to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and holder of every Security of such series with every other such taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or more holders of Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the holders of any other of such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Securities of such series. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section, each and every Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, however, the right of any holder of any Security to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Security, as therein provided, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates or redemption date, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder. SECTION 6.05. (a) All powers and remedies given by this Article to the Trustee or to the Securityholders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any others thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Securities, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture or otherwise established with respect to such Securities. (b) No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Securities to exercise any right or power accruing upon 39
any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, every power and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Securityholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders. SECTION 6.06. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series; provided, however, that such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture or unduly prejudicial to the rights of holders of Securities of any other series at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04 not parties thereto. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed might involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, may on behalf of the holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained herein or established pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Securities of that series as and when the same shall become due by the terms of such Securities otherwise than by acceleration (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal otherwise than by acceleration and any premium has been deposited with the Trustee (in accordance with Section 6.01(c))) or a call for redemption of Securities of that series. Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby shall be deemed to be cured for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. 40
SECTION 6.07. The Trustee shall, within 90 days after the occurrence of a default with respect to a particular series, transmit by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the holders of Securities of that series, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register, notice of all defaults with respect to that series known to the Trustee, unless such defaults shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice (the term "defaults" for the purposes of this Section being hereby defined to be the events specified in subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of Section 6.01(a), not including any periods of grace provided for therein and irrespective of the giving of notice provided for by subsection (4) of Section 6.01(a)); provided, that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities of that series or in the payment of any sinking or analogous fund installment established with respect to that series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers, of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the holders of Securities of that series; provided further, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 6.01(a)(4) with respect to Securities of such series no such notice to the holders of the Securities of that series shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any default, except (i) a default under subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) or (a)(4) of Section 6.01 as long as the Trustee is acting as paying agent for such series of Securities or (ii) any default as to which the Trustee shall have received written notice or a Responsible Officer charged with the administration of this Indenture shall have obtained written notice. SECTION 6.08. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Securities by his or her acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to 41
any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder, or group of Securityholders, holding more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of such series, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security or established pursuant to this Indenture. ARTICLE SEVEN CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE SECTION 7.01. (a) The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to Securities of a series and after the curing of all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series which may have occurred, shall undertake to perform with respect to Securities of such series such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. In case an Event of Default with respect to Securities of a series has occurred (which has not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise with respect to Securities of that series such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. (b) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (1) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to Securities of a series and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default with respect to that series which may have occurred: (i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall with respect to Securities of such series be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to Securities of such series except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and 42
(ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may with respect to Securities of such series conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein); (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the written direction of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that series; and (4) none of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur or risk personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Trustee reasonably believes that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Indenture or adequate indemnity against such risk is not reasonably assured to it. (c) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 7.01. 43
SECTION 7.02. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.01: (a) The Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, demand, approval, bond, security or other paper or document believed by it (i) to be genuine and (ii) to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (b) Any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution or an Officers' Certificate (unless other evidence in respect thereof is specifically prescribed herein); (c) The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (d) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Securityholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby; nothing herein contained shall, however, relieve the Trustee of the obligation, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to a series of the Securities (which has not been cured or waived) to exercise with respect to Securities of that series such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs; (e) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture; (f) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, direction, order, demand, approval, bond, security, or other 44
papers or documents, unless requested in writing so to do by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of the particular series affected thereby (determined as provided in Section 8.04); provided, however, that if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such costs, expenses or liabilities as a condition to so proceeding. The reasonable expense of every such examination shall be paid by the Company or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company upon demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee, in its direction, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit. In making any investigation required or authorized by this subparagraph, the Trustee shall be entitled to examine books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; (g) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; (h) The permissive right of the Trustee to do things enumerated in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty; (i) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder; and (j) The Trustee may request that the Company deliver a certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded. SECTION 7.03. (a) The recitals contained herein and in the Securities (other than the Certificate of Authentication on the Securities) shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the 45
same. (b) The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. (c) The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of any of the Securities or of the proceeds of such Securities, or for the use or application of any monies paid over by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture or established pursuant to Section 2.01, or for the use or application of any monies received by any paying agent other than the Trustee. SECTION 7.04. The Trustee or any paying agent or Security Registrar, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, paying agent or Security Registrar. SECTION 7.05. Subject to the provisions of Section 11.04, all monies received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any monies received by it hereunder except such as it may agree in writing with the Company to pay thereon. SECTION 7.06. (a) The Company covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to such compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Trustee (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) for all services rendered by it in the execution of the trusts hereby created and in the exercise and performance of any of the powers and duties hereunder of the Trustee, and the Company will pay or reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the reasonable expenses and disbursements of its counsel and agents and of all persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Company also covenants to indemnify the Trustee (and its officers, agents, directors and employees) for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Trustee and arising out 46
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. (b) The obligations of the Company under this Section to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness hereunder. Such additional indebtedness shall be secured by a lien prior to that of the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the holders of particular Securities. (c) Without prejudice to any other rights available to the Trustee under applicable law, when the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default, the expenses (including reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and compensation for its services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. (d) The provisions of this Section 7.06 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or the appointment of a successor trustee. SECTION 7.07. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.01, whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee and such certificate, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof. SECTION 7.08. If the Trustee has acquired or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. 47
SECTION 7.09. There shall at all times be a Trustee with respect to the Securities issued hereunder which shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or any State or Territory thereof or of the District of Columbia, or a corporation or other person permitted to act as trustee by the Commission, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least 50 million dollars, and subject to supervision or examination by Federal, State, Territorial, or District of Columbia authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. The Company may not, nor may any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company, serve as Trustee. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 7.10. SECTION 7.10. (a) The Trustee or any successor hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company and by transmitting notice of resignation by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Securityholders of such series, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee with respect to Securities of such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to Securities of such series, or any Securityholder of that series who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 6.08, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee. (b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur: 48
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 7.08 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months; or (2) The Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Securityholder; or (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation; then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 6.08, unless, with respect to subsection (b)(1) above, the Trustee's duty to resign is stayed as provided in Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee. (c) The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to such series and appoint a successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. (d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the Securities 49
of a series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 7.11. (e) Any successor trustee appointed pursuant to this Section may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more series or all of such series, and at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series. SECTION 7.11. (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights, powers, and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject to any prior lien provided for in Section 7.06(b). (b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates, (2) shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall 50
constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust, that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee and that no Trustee shall be responsible for any act or failure to act on the part of any other Trustee hereunder; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein, such retiring Trustee shall with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates have no further responsibility for the exercise of rights and powers or for the performance of the duties and obligations vested in the Trustee under this Indenture, and each such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee, to the extent contemplated by such supplemental indenture, the property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates. (c) Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be. (d) No successor trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and eligible under this Article. (e) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this Section, the Company shall transmit notice of the succession of such trustee hereunder by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Securityholders, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. If the Company fails to transmit such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be transmitted at the expense of the Company. SECTION 7.12. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any 51
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be qualified under the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act and eligible under the provisions of Section 7.09, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. SECTION 7.13. If and when the Trustee shall become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding collection of claims against the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities). ARTICLE EIGHT CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS SECTION 8.01. Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of such majority or specified percentage of that series have joined therein may be evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such holders of Securities of that series in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing. If the Company shall solicit from the Securityholders of any series any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, the Company may, at its option, as evidenced by an Officers' Certificate, fix in advance a record date for such series for the determination of Securityholders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver 52
or other action may be given before or after the record date, but only the Securityholders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Securityholders for the purposes of determining whether Securityholders of the requisite proportion of outstanding Securities of that series have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, and for that purpose the outstanding Securities of that series shall be computed as of the record date; provided that no such authorization, agreement or consent by such Securityholders on the record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date. In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, the principal amount of a Discount Security that shall be deemed to be outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date of such determination upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.01. SECTION 8.02. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder (such proof will not require notarization) or his agent or proxy and proof of the holding by any person of any of the Securities shall be sufficient if made in the following manner: (a) The fact and date of the execution by any such person of any instrument may be proved in any reasonable manner acceptable to the Trustee. (b) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register of such Securities or by a certificate of the Security Registrar thereof. (c) The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary. SECTION 8.03. Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the person in whose name such Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the 53
Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.03) interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. SECTION 8.04. In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities of that series which are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under common control with the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities of such series which the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding for the purposes of this Section, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not a person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any such other obligor. In case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee. SECTION 8.05. At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 8.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any holder of a Security of that series which is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee, and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security, and of any Security issued in exchange therefor, on registration of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Security. Any action taken by 54
the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities of that series. ARTICLE NINE SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES SECTION 9.01. In addition to any supplemental indenture otherwise authorized by this Indenture, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect), without the consent of the Securityholders, for one or more of the following purposes: (a) to evidence the succession of another person to the Company, and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Company contained herein or otherwise established with respect to the Securities; or (b) to add to the covenants of the Company such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions for the protection of the holders of the Securities of all or any series, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any of such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions a default or an Event of Default with respect to such series permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture as herein set forth; provided, however, that in respect of any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such default or may limit the right of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series to waive such default; or (c) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture, or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under this Indenture as shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture and shall not materially and adversely affect the 55
interests of the holders of the Securities of any series; or (d) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture or to add any new provision to this Indenture; provided, however, that such change, elimination or addition shall become effective only when there is no Security outstanding of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provisions; or (e) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Section 2.01; or (f) to add any additional Events of Default with respect to all or any series of outstanding Securities; or (g) to provide collateral security for the Securities; or (h) to provide for the authentication and delivery of bearer securities and coupons appertaining thereto representing interest, if any, thereon and for the procedures for the registration, exchange and replacement thereof and for the giving of notice to, and the solicitation of the vote or consent of, the holders thereof, and for any other matters incidental thereto; or (i) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a separate or successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Article Seven; or (j) to change any place or places where (1) the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on all or any series of Securities shall be payable, (2) all or any series of Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer, (3) all or any series of Securities may be surrendered for exchange and (4) notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of all or any series of Securities and this Indenture may be served; provided, however, that any such place shall be located in New York, New York or be the principal office of the Company; or (k) to provide for the payment by the Company of additional amounts in respect of certain taxes imposed on certain holders and for the treatment of such additional amounts as interest and for all matters incidental thereto; or 56
(l) to provide for the issuance of Securities denominated in a currency other than Dollars or in a composite currency and for all matters incidental thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Trust Indenture Act as in effect at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture or at any time thereafter shall be amended and (x) if any such amendment shall require one or more changes to any provisions hereof or the inclusion herein of any additional provisions, or shall by operation of law be deemed to effect such changes or incorporate such provisions by reference or otherwise, this Indenture shall be deemed to have been amended so as to conform to such amendment to the Trust Indenture Act, and the Company and the Trustee may, without the consent of any Securityholders, enter into a supplemental indenture hereto to effect or evidence such changes or additional provisions; or (y) if any such amendment shall permit one or more changes to, or the elimination of, any provisions hereof which, at the date of the execution and delivery hereof or at any time thereafter, are required by the Trust Indenture Act to be contained herein, this Indenture shall be deemed to have been amended to effect such changes or elimination, and the Company and the Trustee may, without the consent of any Securityholders, enter into a supplemental indenture hereto to effect such changes or elimination; or (z) if, by reason of any such amendment, one or more provisions which, at the date of the execution and delivery hereof or at any time thereafter, are required by the Trust Indenture Act to be contained herein shall be deemed to be incorporated herein by reference or otherwise, or otherwise made applicable hereto, and shall no longer be required to be contained herein, the Company and the Trustee may, without the consent of any Securityholders, enter into a supplemental indenture hereto to effect the elimination of such provisions. The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Company in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's 57
own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section may be executed by the Company and the Trustee without the consent of the holders of any of the Securities at the time outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 9.02. SECTION 9.02. With the consent (evidenced as provided in Section 8.01) of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series affected by such supplemental indenture or indentures at the time outstanding voting as one class, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity date or dates of any Securities of any series, (ii) extend the time of payment of interest or on any sinking fund payment, other than extensions permitted pursuant to Section 2.01, (iii) reduce the rate of interest on any Security, (iv) reduce the principal amount due for payment on any Security, (v) make the principal, premium, if any, or interest on a Security payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in such Security, (vi) modify any redemption or repurchase right to the detriment of a Securityholder, (vii) impair the right of any Securityholder to institute suit for payment, (viii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, or reduce the percentage of Securities, the holders of which are required to waive any covenant or default and its consequences, (ix) waive any past payment default, or (x) modify any provision of Section 9.02, without the consent of the holders of each Security then outstanding and affected thereby. Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a Board Resolution authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Securityholders required to consent thereto as aforesaid, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental 58
indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture. A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture that has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or that modifies the rights of holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the holders of Securities of any other series. It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders of any series affected thereby under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall transmit by mail, first class postage prepaid, a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, to the Securityholders of all series affected thereby as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. Any failure of the Trustee to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture. SECTION 9.03. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article or of Section 10.01, this Indenture shall, with respect to such series, be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of Securities of the series affected thereby shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes. SECTION 9.04. Securities of any series, affected by a supplemental indenture, authenticated and delivered after the execution of such supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article, Article Two or Article Seven or of Section 10.01, may bear a notation in form approved by the 59
Company, provided such form meets the requirements of any exchange upon which such series may be listed, as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of that series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may be prepared by the Company, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Securities of that series then outstanding. SECTION 9.05. The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article is authorized or permitted by, and conforms to, the terms of this Article and that it is proper for the Trustee under the provisions of this Article to join in the execution thereof. ARTICLE TEN CONSOLIDATION, MERGER AND SALE SECTION 10.01. The Company covenants that it will not merge into or consolidate with any other corporation or other entity (whether or not affiliated with the Company) or sell, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property to any other corporation or other entity (whether or not affiliated with the Company or its successor or successors), unless (i) such other corporation or Person shall expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on all the Securities of all series in accordance with the terms of each series, according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture with respect to each series or established with respect to such series pursuant to Section 2.01 to be kept or performed by the Company by supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee, executed and delivered to the Trustee by such corporation or Person and (ii) immediately after giving effect to such merger or consolidation, or such sale, conveyance, transfer or lease or other disposition, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Any Person may merge into or consolidate with the Company provided that the Company is the surviving corporation. SECTION 10.02. (a) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition and upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by supplemental 60
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the due and punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all of the Securities of all series outstanding and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture or established with respect to each series of the Securities pursuant to Section 2.01 to be kept or performed by the Company with respect to each series, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company, with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the party of the first part, and thereupon (provided, that in the case of a lease, the term of the lease is at least as long as the longest maturity of any Securities outstanding at such time) the predecessor corporation shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities. Such successor corporation thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company or any other predecessor obligor on the Securities, any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor company, instead of the Company, and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the predecessor Company to the Trustee for authentication, and any Securities which such successor corporation thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All the Securities so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Securities theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Securities had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. (b) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Securities thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate. (c) Nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent the Company from merging into itself or acquiring by purchase or otherwise all or any part of the property of any other corporation (whether or not affiliated with the Company). SECTION 10.03. The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, shall receive an Officers' Certificate and an 61
Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition, and any such assumption, comply with the provisions of this Article. ARTICLE ELEVEN SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE; UNCLAIMED MONIES SECTION 11.01. Securities of a series may be defeased in accordance with their terms and, unless the Company Order or supplemental indenture establishing the series otherwise provides, in accordance with this Article. The Company at any time may terminate as to a series all of its obligations for such series under this Indenture ("legal defeasance option"). The Company at any time may terminate as to a series its obligations, if any, under any restrictive covenant, including under Section 4.05 and Article 10, which may be applicable to a particular series ("covenant defeasance option"). However, in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.05, 2.07, 4.02, 7.06, 7.10 and 11.04 shall survive until the Securities of the series are no longer outstanding; thereafter the Company's obligations in Sections 7.06, 7.10 and 11.04 shall survive. The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, a series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, a series may not be accelerated by reference to any restrictive covenant which may be applicable to a particular series so defeased under the terms of the series. The Company may exercise as to a series its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option if: (1) The Company irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee or another trustee (x) money in an amount which shall be sufficient; or (y) Eligible Obligations the principal of and the interest on which when due, without regard to reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys, which, together with the money, if any, deposited or held by the Trustee or such other trustee, shall be sufficient, as demonstrated by evidence in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the 62
Trustee; or (z) a combination of money and Eligible Obligations which shall be sufficient, as demonstrated by evidence in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Securities on or prior to maturity; and (2) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that holders of the series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance but will realize income gain or loss on the Securities, including payments of interest thereon, in the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same time as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred and which, in the case of legal defeasance, shall be (x) accompanied by a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service issued to the Company or (y) based on a change in Federal income tax law or regulation occurring after the date hereof. In the event the Company exercises its option to effect a covenant defeasance with respect to the Securities of any series as described above and the Securities of that series are thereafter declared due and payable because of the occurrence of any Event of Default other than the Event of Default caused by failing to comply with the covenants which are defeased, the amount of money and securities on deposit with the Trustee may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Securities of that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default. However, the Company shall remain liable for such payments. SECTION 11.02. All monies or Eligible Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Sections 11.01 or 11.02 shall be held in trust and shall be available for payment as due, either directly or through any paying agent (including the Company acting as its own paying agent), to the holders of the particular series of Securities for the payment or redemption of which such monies or Eligible Obligations have been deposited with the Trustee. SECTION 11.03. In connection with the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture all monies or Eligible Obligations then held by any paying agent under the provisions of this Indenture shall, upon demand of the Company, be paid to the Trustee and thereupon such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such monies or Eligible Obligations. 63
SECTION 11.04.

This Note is one of a duly authorized series of Securities of the Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "Notes"), specified in the Indenture, as hereinafter defined, all issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant to a Senior Note Indenture dated as of duly executed and delivered between the Company and The Bank of New York, a New York banking corporation, as Trustee (herein referred to as the "Trustee") (such Indenture, as originally executed and delivered and as thereafter supplemented and amended being herein referred to as the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto or Company Orders reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Notes.

This Global Note is exchangeable for Notes in definitive registered form only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture.

Any such consent or waiver by the registered holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.03 of the Indenture) interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
