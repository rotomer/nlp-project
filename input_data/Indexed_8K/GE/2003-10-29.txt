GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY DEBT SECURITIES AND/OR WARRANTS TO PURCHASE DEBT SECURITIES UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT STANDARD PROVISIONS October 21, 2003 Ladies and Gentlemen: General Electric Company, a New York corporation (the "Company"), may from time to time enter into one or more underwriting agreements in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto (each an "Underwriting Agreement") that provide for the sale of certain of its securities specified in the particular Underwriting Agreement (the "Designated Securities"). The basic provisions set forth herein to the extent applicable to securities of the type represented by the Designated Securities will be incorporated by reference in any such Underwriting Agreement relating to a particular issue of Designated Securities. Each Underwriting Agreement will be entered into, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine and shall be specified in such Underwriting Agreement. The Underwriting Agreement may appoint a lead underwriter or underwriters (collectively, the "Representative") for the particular issue of Designated Securities and will specify the underwriters participating in such offering (the "Underwriters", which term shall include any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 9 hereof). The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Designated Securities and the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Designated Securities shall be evidenced by the Underwriting Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. The Underwriting Agreement, including the provisions incorporated therein by reference, is herein referred to as "this Agreement." The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement shall be several and not joint. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Underwriting Agreement are used herein as defined therein. 7
The terms and rights of any particular issue of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Underwriting Agreement relating thereto and (i) if the Designated Securities are either senior or subordinated debt securities ("Debt Securities"), in or pursuant to the senior or subordinated indenture as applicable (the "Indenture") identified in the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) if the Designated Securities are warrants ("Warrants"), in or pursuant to a warrant agreement (the "Warrant Agreement") identified in the Underwriting Agreement and (iii) if the Designated Securities are debt securities subject to the warrants ("Warrant Debt Securities"), pursuant to the Indenture identified in the Underwriting Agreement. An Underwriting Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. A registration statement in respect of the Designated Securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); the registration statement has been declared effective by the Commission and each Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement has been issued and no proceeding for the purpose has been initiated or threatened by the Commission. The Company proposes to file pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Designated Securities and has previously advised the Underwriters of all information to be set forth therein. The term "Registration Statement" means the registration statement as amended to the date of this Agreement, including the information, if any, deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 434(d) under the rules and regulations of the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations") and any related Registration Statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations. The term "Basic Prospectus" means the prospectus included in the Registration Statement. The term "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus together with the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Designated Securities, as first filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 (the "Prospectus Supplement"); provided, however, that if the Company elects to rely upon Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, then all references to the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to the Basic Prospectus and the term sheet relating to the Designated Securities in the form furnished to the Underwriters by the Company in reliance upon Rule 434. The term "Preliminary Prospectus" means a preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Designated Securities together with the Basic Prospectus. All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus, as the case may be, prior to the execution of the applicable Underwriting Agreement; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act") which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus, as the case may be, after the execution of the applicable Underwriting Agreement. 8
SECTION 1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. (a). REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY. The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter named in the applicable Underwriting Agreement, as of the date thereof and as of the Closing Time (as defined below) as follows: (1) each document filed by the Company pursuant to the 1934 Act which is incorporated by reference in the Prospectus complied when so filed in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and each document, if any, hereafter filed by the Company and so incorporated by reference in the Prospectus will comply when so filed with the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; (2) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply, and the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (and any amendments and supplements thereto, other than supplements relating only to securities, other than the Designated Securities) will as of the Closing Time comply, in all material respects with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations. (3) each Preliminary Prospectus, if any, relating to the Designated Securities filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act complied when so filed in all material respects with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations; and (4) each part of the Registration Statement at the time such part became effective did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Prospectus as of the date of the prospectus supplement relating to the Designated Securities did not, and the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented, other than as to supplements relating only to securities other than the Designated Securities) as of the Closing Time will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; except that these representations and warranties do not apply to (i) statements or omissions in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements to the foregoing, based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter expressly for use therein and (ii) any Form T-1 Statement of Eligibility and Qualification included as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. SECTION 2. SALE AND DELIVERY; CLOSING. (a) DELAYED DELIVERY CONTRACTS. Pursuant to the applicable Underwriting Agreement, the Company will agree to sell to the several Underwriters named in Schedule I thereto and the Underwriters, upon the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the conditions hereinafter stated, will agree to purchase from the Company severally and not jointly, (i) the principal amounts of Debt Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I thereto, less their respective amounts of the Contract Debt Securities (as hereinafter defined), if 9
any, determined as provided below, and/or (ii) Warrants to purchase the principal amounts of Warrant Debt Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I thereto, less their respective amounts of the Contract Warrants (as hereinafter defined), if any, determined as provided below, all at the respective purchase prices set forth in such Underwriting Agreement, plus accrued interest, if any, from the date set forth therein to the date of payment and delivery. Debt Securities and, if applicable, Warrants to be purchased pursuant to delayed delivery contracts are hereinafter referred to as "Contract Debt Securities" and "Contract Warrants", respectively, and collectively as the "Contract Securities". If so indicated in the applicable Underwriting Agreement, the Company may authorize the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Contract Securities on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein pursuant to delayed delivery contracts substantially in the form of Exhibit D attached hereto but with such changes therein as the Company may authorize or approve (hereinafter referred to as "Delayed Delivery Contracts"). Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors approved by the Company and described in the Prospectus. The aggregate principal amount of Contract Debt Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Warrant Debt Securities for which Contract Warrants are exercisable shall not exceed the respective amounts set forth in Schedule I to the applicable Underwriting Agreement. As of the Closing Time, the Company will pay to the Representative as compensation, for the accounts of the Underwriters, the fee specified in the applicable Underwriting Agreement in respect of all Contract Securities. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. If the Designated Securities are Debt Securities, the deduction for the Contract Debt Securities referred to above shall become effective upon execution and delivery by the Company and the several institutional investors of the Delayed Delivery Contracts and such deduction for each Underwriter shall be in the amount which shall bear the same proportion to the total principal amount of Contract Debt Securities as the principal amount of Debt Securities set forth opposite the name of the respective Underwriter bears to the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities set forth in Schedule I to the applicable Underwriting Agreement, except to the extent that the Representative determines that such deduction shall be otherwise than in such proportions, and so advises the Company in writing. If the Designated Securities are Warrants and Debt Warrant Securities, the deduction for the Contract Warrants referred to above shall become effective upon execution and delivery by the Company and the several institutional investors of the Delayed Delivery Contracts and such deduction for each Underwriter shall be in the amount which shall bear the same proportion to the total principal amount of Debt Warrant Securities for which Contract Warrants are exercisable as the principal amount of Debt Warrant Securities for which Warrants are exercisable as set forth opposite the name of the respective Underwriter bears to the aggregate principal amount of Debt Warrant Securities for which Warrants are exercisable as set forth in Schedule I to the applicable Underwriting Agreement, except to the extent that the Representative determines that such deduction shall be otherwise than in such proportions, and so advises the Company in writing. 10
(b) SALES TO UNDERWRITERS. The several commitments of the Underwriters to purchase the Designated Securities pursuant to the applicable Underwriting Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. (c) PAYMENT. Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement relating thereto, in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representative may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representative for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor in the funds and in the manner specified in such Underwriting Agreement, all at the place and time and date specified in such Underwriting Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the Representative and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "Closing Time" for such Designated Securities. Concurrently with the delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities, the Company will deliver to the Representative for the accounts of the Underwriters a check payable or wire transfer to the order of the party designated in the Underwriting Agreement relating to such securities in the amount of any compensation payable by the Company to the Underwriters in respect of any Delayed Deliver Contracts as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section 2 and in the Underwriting Agreement related to such securities. SECTION 3. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. The Company covenants with each Underwriter of the Designated Securities as follows: (a) COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES REGULATIONS AND COMMISSION REQUESTS. The Company will comply in respect of the Designated Securities with the requirements of the 1933 Act Regulations, as applicable, and will promptly effect the filings necessary pursuant to Rule 424 and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the Prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424 was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file the Prospectus. (b) DELIVERY OF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS AND PROSPECTUSES. The Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Time and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus relating to the Designated Securities and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representative may reasonably request. (c) CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS. If at any time when the Prospectus relating to the Designated Securities is required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Designated Securities, any event shall occur as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the 11
circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of such counsel, at any such time to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to make the Prospectus comply with such requirements, and the Company will furnish to the Underwriters, without charge, such number of copies of such amendment or supplement as the Underwriters may reasonably request. (d) BLUE SKY QUALIFICATIONS. The Company will use its best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Designated Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may reasonably request; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction. (e) EARNINGS STATEMENT. The Company will make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the date of each Underwriting Agreement, an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations. SECTION 4. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES.

Commission, and there shall have been no material adverse change (not in the ordinary course of business) in the condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Prospectus; and the Representative shall have received at the Closing Time a certificate of the Company, dated the date of Closing Time and signed by an officer of the Company, to the foregoing effect. The officer making such certificate may rely upon the best of his knowledge as to proceedings pending or threatened. (b) At Closing Time, the Representative shall have received the opinion, dated such date, of Robert E. Healing, corporate counsel, relating to the Designated Securities, to the effect set forth in Exhibit B hereto. (c) At Closing Time, the Representative shall have received the opinion, dated such date, of Dewey Ballantine LLP, counsel for the Company, relating to the Designated Securities, to the effect set forth in Exhibit C hereto. (d) At Closing Time, the Representative shall have received the opinion, dated such date, of counsel for the Underwriters, relating to the Designated Securities and such other matters as the Representative may reasonably request.

SECTION 6. (a) INDEMNIFICATION. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (if used within the period set forth in paragraph (c) of Section 3 hereof and as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter expressly for the use therein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing indemnity with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus or any Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any losses, claims, damages or liabilities otherwise covered by this paragraph purchased Designated Securities, or to the benefit of any person controlling such Underwriter, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended and supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of Designated Securities to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability. Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information furnished in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto. Promptly after receipt by any person of notice of any claim or the institution of any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "indemnified party") shall notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it elects (upon notice to the indemnified party), jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party shall not have so elected to assume such defense, then, upon request of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. If the indemnifying party shall so elect to assume such defense, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party pursuant to this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and 14
the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties. Anything hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding, any reference in this Section 6 to counsel reasonably satisfactory to , or designated by, the indemnified party shall mean (i) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory, or designated by, the Representative on behalf of all parties so indemnified pursuant to such paragraph and (ii) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph, counsel reasonable satisfactory, or designated by, the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgement for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (b) CONTRIBUTION. If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of Section 6 is unavailable as a matter of law to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) if the indemnifying party is the Company, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefit received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities, (ii) if an Underwriter is the indemnifying party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the Underwriter's relative fault on the one hand and that of the Company on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or (iii) if the allocation provided by claims (i) or clause (ii) above, as the case may be, is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefit referred to in clause (i) above or the relative fault referred to in clause (ii) above, as the case may be, but also such relative fault (in cases covered by clause (i)) or such relative benefit (in cases covered by clause (ii)) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omissions. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this paragraph were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the 15
Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations provided for, in the respective cases, in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provision of this paragraph (b) concerning contribution, no indemnifying party shall be required to make contribution in any circumstances in which such party would not have been required to provide indemnification by the terms of paragraph (a). Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by an indemnified party of such party's rights, if any, to receive contribution pursuant to Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act or other applicable law. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this section are several, in proportion to the respective amounts of Designated Securities underwritten by each of such Underwriters, and not joint. In the event that the indemnifying party is one or more of the Underwriters, then the Representative shall act on behalf of the indemnifying party with respect to receipt of notice, agreement as to retention of separate counsel and consent to settlement, and the indemnified party may rely upon the action of the Representative as binding upon each such indemnifying party for purposes of this section. SECTION 7. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities. The provisions of Section 6 shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. SECTION 8. TERMINATION. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the discretion of a majority in interest of the Representative of a particular issue of Designated Securities at any time subsequent to the date of the applicable Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date by notice given to the Company, if (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in the State of New York or the United States shall have been declared by the appropriate authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any material outbreak, or material escalation, of 16
hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis, of such magnitude and severity in it effect on the financial markets of the United States, in the reasonable judgment of a majority in interest of the Representative, as to prevent or materially impair the marketing, or enforcement of contracts for sale, of the Designated Securities. SECTION 9. DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Designated Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Underwriting Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then: (a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Designated Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Underwriting Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under such Underwriting Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Designated Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Underwriting Agreement, such Underwriting Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. No action taken pursuant to this Section 9 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Underwriting Agreement either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. SECTION 10. NOTICES. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Underwriters, will be mailed, delivered or faxed and confirmed to them, at the address of the Representative described in the applicable Underwriting Agreement; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or faxed and confirmed to it, at 3135 Easton Turnpike, Fairfield, Connecticut 06431; attention Robert E. Healing, Esq. SECTION 11. PARTIES. This Agreement shall each inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, the Representative and any other Underwriters and their respective successors.

No. R- GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY $ LIBOR Floating Rate Notes due CUSIP: Original Issue Date: ISIN: Common Code: Stated Maturity Date: Principal Amount: $ Redeemable: GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York (herein referred to as the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO. or registered assigns, the Principal Amount specified above on the Stated Maturity Date specified above, and to pay interest on said Principal Amount from the Original Issue Date specified above or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly in arrears on , , and in each year, commencing , and on the Stated Maturity Date at the per annum interest rate determined as specified herein by the Calculation Agent on each Interest Determination Date, as such terms are defined herein, until the Principal Amount shall have been paid or duly provided for. Interest shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360 day year. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, as provided in the Indenture, as hereinafter defined, shall be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) shall have been registered at the close of business on the regular record date with respect to such Interest Payment Date, which shall be the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day (as
defined below)) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided, that interest payable on the Stated Maturity Date shall be paid to the Person to whom principal shall be paid. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the holder on such regular record date and shall be paid as provided in said Indenture. If any Interest Payment Date (other than the Stated Maturity Date) is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date (other than the Stated Maturity Date) shall be the next preceding Business Day. If the Stated Maturity Date is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal and interest on this Note will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for the period from and after such date to the next succeeding Business Day. RATE OF INTEREST The interest rate on this Note will be reset quarterly on , , and of each year, commencing (each, an "Interest Reset Date"), and this Note will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR (as defined below) for the applicable Interest Reset Period (as defined below), plus %. The interest rate for the Initial Interest Reset Period (as defined below) will be three-month LIBOR, determined as of two London Business Days (as defined below) prior to the Original Issue Date, plus % per annum. The "Initial Interest Reset Period" will be the period from and including the Original Issue Date to but excluding the Initial Interest Reset Date. Thereafter, each "Interest Reset Period" will be the period from and including an Interest Reset Date to but excluding the immediately succeeding Interest Reset Date; PROVIDED that the final Interest Reset Period for this Note will be the period from and including the Interest Reset Date immediately preceding the Stated Maturity Date of this Note to but excluding the Stated Maturity Date. If any Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Reset Date shall be the next preceding Business Day. The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if that day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date or (ii) if that day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date immediately preceding the most recent Interest Reset Date or the Original Issue Date, as the case may be. "Business Day" means a day which is not a day when banking institutions in the city in which the Trustee administers its corporate trust business, currently New York City, or in the place of payment, are authorized or required by law or regulation to be closed, and that is also a "London Business Day", which is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. 2
INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION The interest rate applicable to each Interest Reset Period commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, or the Original Issue Date in the case of the Initial Interest Reset Period, will be the rate determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date. The "Interest Determination Date" will be the second London Business Day immediately preceding the Original Issue Date, in the case of the Initial Reset Period, or thereafter the applicable Interest Reset Date. Three-month LIBOR (hereafter referred to as "LIBOR") will be determined by The Bank of New York, or its successor appointed by the Company, acting as calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent"), as of the applicable Interest Determination Date in accordance with the following provisions: (i) LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the offered rates for deposits in U.S. dollars having a three-month maturity, commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date, which appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 (as defined below) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. "Moneyline Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated on page "3750" on Moneyline Telerate (or such other page as may replace the 3750 page on that service, any successor service or such other service or services as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits). If no rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (ii) below. (ii) With respect to an Interest Determination Date on which no rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date, the Calculation Agent shall request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks (which may include affiliates of the underwriters) in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) to provide the Calculation Agent with a quotation of the rate at which deposits of U.S. dollars having a three-month maturity, commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date, are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations as calculated by the Calculation Agent. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include affiliates of the underwriters) selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having a three-month maturity commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. 3
$1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at such time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the banks selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting such rates as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR determined with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Determination Date. All percentages resulting from any calculation of any interest rate for this Note will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward and all dollar amounts will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward. Promptly upon such determination, the Calculation Agent will notify the Company and the Trustee (if the Calculation Agent is not the Trustee) of the interest rate for the new Interest Reset Period.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the holders of the Notes of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Notes of such series as and when the same shall become due by the terms of the Notes otherwise than by acceleration (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal otherwise than by acceleration and any premium has been deposited with the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture) or a call for redemption of Notes of that series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
