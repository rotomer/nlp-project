Item 5. Other Events
     On March 30, 2004, General Electric Company (GE) filed a Form 8-K providing reclassified information about the January 1, 2004, reorganization of our businesses.

Attached as Exhibit 99 is a revised Summary of Operating Segments reflecting the corrected data. The information included in this Form 8-KA affects only disclosures related to 2000 segment results and in no way restates or revises the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of GE.
