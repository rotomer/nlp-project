As stated in the Company's 2004 Proxy Statement, in connection with the acquisition of Amersham plc, the Company agreed to appoint Castell, Amersham's chief executive officer, to the board as a Vice Chairman after the completion of the acquisition because of his broad business experience and extensive industry knowledge.

Following the completion of the acquisition, Castell was appointed President and CEO of GE Healthcare, a position he obtained by entering into a Service Agreement with the Company, amended and restated as of February 11, 2004. Under the terms of the Service Agreement, among other things, Castell's annual basic salary is 1,000,000, and he is also entitled to an annual bonus of not less than 1,000,000, subject to continued employment and satisfactory performance.
