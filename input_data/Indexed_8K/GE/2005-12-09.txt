INDEMNIFICATION
 
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, (i) with reference to information furnished in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Material or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto and (ii) arising from any other free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter, except to the extent arising from information furnished in writing by the Company expressly for use therein.
 
Promptly after receipt by any person of notice of any claim or the institution of any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either of the two preceding paragraphs, such person (the "") shall notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it elects (upon notice to the indemnified party), jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party shall not have so elected to assume such defense, then, upon request of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. If the indemnifying party shall so elect to assume such defense, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party pursuant to this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties. Anything hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding, any reference in this Section 6 to counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the indemnified party shall mean (i) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the second preceding paragraph, counsel reasonably satisfactory to, or designated by, the Representative on behalf of all parties so indemnified pursuant to such paragraph and (ii) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to the first preceding paragraph, counsel reasonable satisfactory to, or designated by, the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

indemnifying party
 
(b) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of Section 6 is unavailable as a matter of law to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) if the indemnifying party is the Company, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefit received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities, (ii) if an Underwriter is the indemnifying party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the Underwriter's relative fault on the one hand and that of the Company on the other hand in
CONTRIBUTION
 
connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or (iii) if the allocation provided by claims (i) or clause (ii) above, as the case may be, is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefit referred to in clause (i) above or the relative fault referred to in clause (ii) above, as the case may be, but also such relative fault (in cases covered by clause (i)) or such relative benefit (in cases covered by clause (ii)) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefit received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omissions.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this paragraph were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations provided for, in the respective cases, in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Designated Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provision of this paragraph (b) concerning contribution, no indemnifying party shall be required to make contribution in any circumstances in which such party would not have been required to provide indemnification by the terms of paragraph (a). Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by an indemnified party of such party's rights, if any, to receive contribution pursuant to Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act or other applicable law. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this section are several, in proportion to the respective amounts of Designated Securities underwritten by each of such Underwriters, and not joint.
 
In the event that the indemnifying party is one or more of the Underwriters, then the Representative shall act on behalf of the indemnifying party with
 
respect to receipt of notice, agreement as to retention of separate counsel and consent to settlement, and the indemnified party may rely upon the action of the Representative as binding upon each such indemnifying party for purposes of this section.
 
SECTION 7. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Designated Securities. The provisions of Section shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Defaulted Securities
 
(A) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Designated Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Underwriting Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under such Underwriting Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
 
(B) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Designated Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Underwriting Agreement, such Underwriting Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section 9 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
 
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Underwriting Agreement either the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
 
The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
 
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
 
The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next
 
paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.

If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
 
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section 104, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section 104, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
 
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents, each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
 
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; provided, however, that in the case of Securities offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Securities from time to time in accordance with such other procedures (including, without limitation, the receipt by the Trustee of oral or electronic instructions from the Company or its duly authorized agents, promptly confirmed in writing) acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified by or pursuant to a Company Order delivered to the Trustee prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
 
(1) if the form or forms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form or forms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
 
(2) if the terms of such Securities have been, or in the case of Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, will be, established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301,

(3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
 
If such forms or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate or Company Order otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued. This paragraph shall not be applicable to Securities of a series that are issued pursuant to the proviso to Section 301(2).

With respect to Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Securities, the form or forms and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and the other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 and this Section, as applicable, in connection with the first authentication of Securities of such series.
 
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 310, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

Temporary Securities
 
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities of such series in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
 
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
 
SECTION 305. .
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange
 
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office being herein sometimes referred to as the "") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided. If in accordance with Section 301(5), the Company designates a transfer agent (in addition to the Security Registrar) with respect to any series of Securities, the Company may at any time rescind the designation of any such transfer agent or approve a change in the location through which any such transfer agent acts, provided that the Company maintains a transfer agent in each Place of Payment for such series. The Company may at any time designate additional transfer agents with respect to any series of Securities.
Security Register
 
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
 
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company and the Security Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities.
 
If the Securities of any series are to be redeemed in part, neither the Trustee nor the Company shall be required, pursuant to the provisions of this Section 305, (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, any portion not to be redeemed.
 
The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities:
 
(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
 
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security, (ii) defaults in the performance of its duties as Depositary, or (iii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as depositary, in each case, unless the Company has approved a successor Depositary within 90 days after receipt of such notice or after it has become aware of such default or cessation, (B) the Company in its sole discretion determines, subject to the procedures of the Depositary, that such Global Security will be so exchangeable or transferable or (C) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301.
 
(3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
 
(4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section 305, Section 304, 306, 906, 1107 or 1305 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
 
SECTION 306. .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee together with such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and shall cancel and dispose of such mutilated Security in accordance with its customary procedures.
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If, after the delivery of such new Security, a bona fide purchaser of the original Security in lieu of which such new Security was issued presents for payment or registration such original Security, the Trustee shall be entitled to recover such new Security from the party to whom it was delivered or any party taking therefrom, except a bona fide purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Company and the Trustee in connection therewith and shall cancel and dispose of such new Security in accordance with its customary procedures.
 
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 306, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel to the Company and the fees and expenses of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section 306 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section 306 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

The initial payment of interest on any Security of any series which is issued between a Regular Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date shall be payable as provided in such Security or in or pursuant to the Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate, Company Order or supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 301 with respect to the related series of Securities. Except in the case of a Global Security, at the option of the Company, interest on any series of Securities may be paid (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as it shall appear on the Security Register of such series or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such account as designated in writing by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Security Register of such series at least fifteen days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date.
 
Any Paying Agents will be identified in accordance with Section 301, except for the Trustee, who has been appointed as Paying Agent for the Securities as provided in the definition of "Paying Agent" contained in Section 101. The Company may at any time designate additional Paying Agents or rescind the designation of any Paying Agent; however, the Company at all times will be required to maintain a Paying Agent in each Place of Payment for each series of Securities.
 
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not timely paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
 
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series in respect of which interest is in default (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as provided in this Clause (1). Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
 
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which such Securities may be listed or traded, and upon such notice as may
 
be required by such exchange or automated quotation system, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
 
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 307, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
(b) The provisions of this Section 307(b) may be made applicable to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 (with such modifications, additions or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 301).

The Company may exercise such option with respect to such Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50 but not more than 60 days prior to an Optional Reset Date for such Security, such notice to contain the information to be included in the Trustee's notice referred to in the following sentence. If the Company exercises such option, not later than 40 days prior to each Optional Reset Date, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, to the Holder of any such Security a notice (the "") indicating that the Company has elected to reset the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable), and (i) such new interest rate (or such new spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) and (ii) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional Reset Date or if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated Maturity of such Security (each such period a ""), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Subsequent Interest Period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the Optional Reset Date, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice and establish an interest rate (or a spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) that is higher than the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice, for the Subsequent Interest Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, notice of such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) to the Holder of such Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Securities with respect to which the interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if applicable) is reset on an Optional Reset Date, and with respect to which the Holders of such Securities have not tendered such Securities for repayment (or have validly revoked any such tender) pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph, will bear such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier, if applicable).
 
The Holder of any such Security will have the option to elect repayment by the Company of the principal of such Security on each Optional Reset Date at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus interest accrued to such Optional Reset Date. In order to obtain repayment on an Optional Reset Date, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article Thirteen for repayment at the option of Holders except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to such Optional Reset Date and except that, if the Holder has tendered any Security for repayment pursuant to the Reset Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender or repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before such Optional Reset Date.
 
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 307 and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

Original Stated Maturity
Extension Notice
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days before the Original Stated Maturity of such Security, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for the Extension Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, notice of such higher interest rate to the Holder of such Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Securities with respect to which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear such higher interest rate.
 
If the Company extends the Maturity of any Security, the Holder will have the option to elect repayment of such Security by the Company on the Original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, plus interest accrued to such date. In order to obtain repayment on the Original Stated Maturity once the Company has extended the Maturity thereof, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article Thirteen for repayment at the option of Holders, except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to the Original Stated Maturity and except that, if the Holder has tendered any Security for repayment pursuant to an Extension Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before the Original Stated Maturity.

In addition, for purposes of determining whether payments in respect of any Security are usurious, all sums paid or agreed to be paid with respect to such Security for the use, forbearance or detention of money shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such Security.

Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
 
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 501(7) which is common to all Outstanding series of Securities) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the
 
Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default under Section 501(7) which is common to all Outstanding series of Securities occurs and is continuing, then in such case, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all the Securities then Outstanding hereunder (treated as one class), by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders) may declare the principal amount (or, if any Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified by the terms thereof) of all the Securities then Outstanding to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.
 
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter provided in this Article Five, the Event of Default giving rise to such declaration of acceleration shall, without further act, be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if:
 
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
 
(A) all overdue installments of interest on all Securities of that series,
 
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities,
 
(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and
 
(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;
 
and
 
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.

(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days,
 
(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, or
 
(3) default is made in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of any Security and such default continues for a period of 30 days,
 
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, all amounts owing the Trustee, its agents and counsel under Section 607.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

Repayment of Securities of any series before their Stated Maturity at the option of Holders thereof shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Securities and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article Thirteen.
 
SECTION 1302. .
Repayment of Securities
 
Securities of any series subject to repayment in whole or in part at the option of the Holders thereof will, unless otherwise provided in the terms of such Securities, be repaid at a price equal to the principal amount thereof and any premium thereon, together with interest thereon accrued to the Repayment Date specified in or pursuant to the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants that on or before the Repayment Date it will deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the principal (or, if so provided by the terms of the Securities of any series, a percentage of the principal) of, the premium, if any, and (except if the Repayment Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities or portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid on such date.
 
SECTION 1303. .
Exercise of Option
 
Securities of any series subject to repayment at the option of the Holders thereof will contain an "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse of such Securities. To be repaid at the option of the Holder, any Security so providing for such repayment, with the "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse of such Security duly completed by the Holder (or by the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), must be received by the Company at the Place of Payment therefor specified in the terms of such Security (or at such other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time notify the Holders of such Securities) not earlier than 45 days nor later than 30 days prior to the Repayment Date. If less than the entire principal amount of such Security is to be repaid in accordance with the terms of such Security, the principal amount of such Security to be repaid, in increments of the minimum denomination for Securities of such series, and the denomination or denominations of the Security or Securities to be issued to the Holder for the portion of the principal amount of such Security surrendered that is not to be repaid, must be specified. The principal amount of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof may not be repaid in part if, following such repayment, the unpaid principal amount of such Security would be less than the minimum authorized denomination of Securities of the series of which such Security to be repaid is a part. Except as otherwise may be provided by the terms of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof and as provided in Sections 307(b) and 308, exercise of the repayment option by the Holder shall be irrevocable unless waived by the Company.
 
SECTION 1304. .
When Securities Presented for Repayment Become Due and Payable
 
If Securities of any series providing for repayment at the option of the Holders thereof shall have been surrendered as provided in this Article Thirteen and as provided by or pursuant to the terms of such Securities, such Securities or the portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid shall become due and payable and shall be paid by the Company on the Repayment Date therein specified, and on and after such Repayment Date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities on such Repayment Date) such Securities shall, if the same were interest-bearing, cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for repayment in accordance with such provisions, the principal amount of such Security so to be repaid shall be paid by the Company, together with accrued interest and/or premium, if any, to (but excluding) the Repayment Date; , that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest, if any, whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable (but without interest thereon, unless the Company shall default in the payment thereof) to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.
provided, however
 
If the principal amount of any Security surrendered for repayment shall not be so repaid upon surrender thereof, such principal amount (together with interest, if any, thereon accrued to such Repayment Date) and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Repayment Date at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) set forth in such Security.
 
SECTION 1305. .
Securities Repaid in Part
 
Upon surrender of any Security which is to be repaid in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge and at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination specified by the Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the portion of the principal of such Security so surrendered which is not to be repaid.

SECTION 1407. .
Reinstatement
 
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article Fourteen with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 1402 or 1403 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article Fourteen with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1406 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article Fourteen; , that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust.

Exhibit 4(b)
 
THIS SECURITY IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF A DEPOSITARY. THIS SECURITY IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR SECURITIES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY.
 
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Company or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
 
 
General Electric Company, a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to C & C., or registered assigns, the principal sum of FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($500,000,000) on December 9, 2008, and to pay interest thereon from December 9, 2005 (the "Original Issue Date") or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly on March 9, June 9, September 9 and December 9 in each year, commencing March 9, 2006 (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), at the rate of interest per annum equal to Three-Month LIBOR (as determined pursuant to the provisions set forth on the reverse of this Security) plus .04%, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest on this Security will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year. If any Interest Payment Date other than December 9, 2008 falls on a day which is not a Business Day (as defined below) such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except that if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the next preceding Business Day. If December 9, 2008 shall not be a Business Day, payment of the principal and interest due on that date need not be made on that day but may be made on the next day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on December 9, 2008, provided that no interest shall accrue for the period from and after December 9, 2008. A "Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in the

th
calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable on December 9, 2008, shall be payable to the Person to whom the principal of this Security shall be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Securities of this series may be listed or traded, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or automated quotation system, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
 
Payment of the principal of and any such interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Paying Agent maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (currently the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof located at 4 New York Plaza, 15

provided, however
 
The interest payable on any Interest Payment Date will be the amount of interest accrued from, and including, the next preceding Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from and including the Original Issue Date if no interest has been paid or duly provided for with respect to the Securities of this series) to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date.
 
The interest rate on the Securities of this series will be reset quarterly on March 9, June 9, September 9 and December 9 of each year, commencing March 9, 2006 (each an "Interest Reset Date") and the Securities of this series will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Three-Month LIBOR (as defined below) for the applicable Interest Reset Period (as defined below), plus .04 %. The interest rate for the Initial Interest Reset Period will be Three-Month LIBOR, determined as of two London Business Days prior to the Original Issue Date, plus .04 % per annum. The "Initial Interest Reset Period" will be the period from and including the Original Issue Date to but excluding the initial Interest Reset Date. Thereafter, each "Interest Reset Period" will be the period from and including an Interest Reset Date to but excluding the immediately succeeding Interest Reset Date; provided that the final Interest Reset Period for the Securities of this series will be the period from an including the Interest Reset Date immediately preceding December 9, 2008 to but excluding December 9, 2008. If an Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Reset Date will be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Reset Date shall be the next preceding Business Day.
 
The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if that day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) immediately preceding such Interest Reset Date or (ii) if that day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date immediately preceding the most recent Interest Reset Date or the Original Issue Date, as the case may be.
 
The interest rate applicable to each Interest Reset Period commencing on the related Interest Reset Date, or the Original Issue Date in the case of the Initial Interest Reset Period, will be the rate determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date. The "Interest Determination Date" will be the second London Business Day immediately preceding the Original Issue Date, in the case of the Initial Interest Reset Period, or two London Business Days prior to each Interest Reset Date. "London Business Day" means a day which is a Business Day and which is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or its successor appointed by the Company, will act as Calculation Agent. Three-Month LIBOR will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the applicable Interest Determination Date in accordance with the following provisions:
 
(i) Three-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the offered rates for deposits in U.S. dollars having a three-month maturity, commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date, which appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 (as defined below) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date. "Moneyline Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated on page "3750" on Moneyline Telerate (or such other page as may replace the 3750 page on that service, any successor service or such other service or services as may be nominated by the British Banker's Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits). If no rate appears on Moneyline Telerate page 3750, Three-Month LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (ii) below.
 
(ii) With respect to an Interest Determination Date on which no rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750, as specified in (i) above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks (which may include affiliates of the underwriter of the Securities of this series) selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) in the London interbank market to provide the Calculation Agent with a quotation of the rate at which deposits in U.S. dollars having a three month maturity, commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date, are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations as calculated by the Calculation Agent. If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR on such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time on such Interest Determination Date by three major banks (which may include affiliates of the underwriter of the Securities of this series) selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having a three-month maturity commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date
 
and in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less than $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at that time; provided, however, that if the banks selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting such rates as mentioned in this sentence, Three-Month LIBOR for such Interest Determination Date will be Three-Month LIBOR determined with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Determination Date.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation of any interest rate with respect to the Securities of this series will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one-hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards and all dollar amounts will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
 
All calculations made by the Calculation Agent for the purposes of calculating interest on the Securities of this series shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders of such Securities and the Company, absent manifest error.
 
The Securities of this series are not subject to redemption by the Company prior to their Stated Maturity and will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction and discharge of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of all series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected, treated as one class. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and the Trustee shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Security Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
THE INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

Re: Registration Statement on Form S-3
 
I am Corporate and Securities Counsel at General Electric Company (the "Company"). I have represented the Company in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-130117) (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to which $1,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's LIBOR Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the "Notes") were registered. The Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture dated as of December 1, 2005 between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented and amended by an Officers' Certificate dated as of December 9, 2005 (collectively, the "Indenture").
 
I have examined the Registration Statement and the Indenture. I have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered at closing, and upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents or oral statements of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such other and further investigations, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such investigation, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. I have also assumed that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, I am of the opinion that the Notes are valid, binding and legal obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and limited by general equitable principles (regardless of whether the issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
My opinion is limited to matters governed by the Federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of New York.
 
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the statements with respect to my name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the prospectus forming part of the Registration Statement. In giving
the foregoing consent, I do not hereby admit that I come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. This opinion may not be furnished or quoted to, or relied upon by, any other person for any purpose, without my prior written consent.
