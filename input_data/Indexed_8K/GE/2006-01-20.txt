PRESS RELEASE
GE Reports Record Financial Results for Full-Year and Fourth-Quarter 2005
Fairfield, Conn., January 20, 2006
- GE announced today record full-year 2005 earnings from continuing operations of $18.3 billion, or $1.72 per share, up 12% and 10% from 2004. Full-year revenues from continuing operations were also a record $149.7 billion, up 11%, increasing 8% organically. Cash flow from GEs operating activities in 2005 increased 42% to $21.6 billion.
We finished 2005 as we expected with a strong quarter in our business segments that capped an excellent year, said GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. This year we executed on our organic growth initiatives, strengthened our organization and improved our portfolio, including the continued exit from the majority of our insurance businesses.
Looking into 2006, the current economic environment remains positive and is in line with our expectations: we see continued strong growth in Asia and developing markets, mid single-digit growth in the Americas, and slow growth in Europe. This is the kind of environment that plays well to GEs products and services strengths.
Our business fundamentals remain strong. Total year orders were up 10% in 2005, with demand coming from all the businesses. Our equipment backlog was $24 billion at year end and our multi-year services agreements increased to $87 billion, up 15%. We have good visibility into the increasing demand for our products and services in 2006.
 
 
Growth is also fueling robust cash flow. GEs CFOA is up 42%, with Industrial CFOA up 14% over 2004. With these funds we increased the quarterly dividend for the 30
th
straight year and we expanded our stock buyback program from $15 billion through 2007 to $25 billion through 2008. In 2005, we eliminated the remaining parent-supported debt at GE Capital Services ahead of schedule, and we purchased $5 billion of stock, a 67% increase over what we committed to earlier in the year. We plan to repurchase $7-9 billion of our stock in 2006.
 
Highlights of Preliminary Full-Year and Fourth-Quarter 2005 Results
 
 
I am proud of the GE team and our accomplishments. We enter 2006 with solid momentum and a strong outlook, including full-year 2006 EPS from continuing operations of $1.94-2.02, an increase of 13-17% over comparable 2005 earnings. For 1Q06, we expect to achieve EPS of $.38-.40, up 15-21%, said Immelt. This sustained double-digit earnings growth and healthy cash generation should produce strong shareowner returns in 2006.
GE will discuss preliminary fourth-quarter and full-year results on a conference call and Webcast at 8:30 a.m. ET today. Call information is available at

, and related charts will be posted there prior to the call.

Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
2005 results are preliminary and quarterly information is unaudited. This document contains "forward-looking statements" - that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance, and often contain words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," or "will." Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. For us, particular uncertainties which could adversely or positively affect our future results include: the behavior of financial markets, including fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices; strategic actions, including dispositions; future integration of acquired businesses; future financial performance of major industries which we serve, including, without limitation, the air and rail transportation, energy generation, media, real estate and healthcare industries; unanticipated loss development in our insurance businesses; and numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business, competitive and regulatory nature. These uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.

We sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC rules. Specifically, we have referred to organic revenue growth for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the increase in cash from operating activities from our industrial businesses (or Industrial CFOA) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, earnings growth excluding the previously announced corrrection for SFAS 133 and the effects of dispositions of GE's ownership interest in Gecis (now Genpact) and financial services revenue growth excluding the previously announced correction for SFAS 133 and the effects of dispositions of GE's ownership interest in Gecis (now Genpact). The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and their reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures - continuing revenues, cash from operating activities, earnings from continuing operations and financial services revenues - follow.
 
 
 
We believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the likelihood that particular factors will repeat. In some cases, short-term patterns and long-term trends may be obscured by large factors or events. For example, events or trends in a particular segment may be so significant as to obscure patterns and trends of our industrial or financial services businesses in total. For this reason, we believe that investors may find it useful to see our 2005 growth in continuing revenues without the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange rates, without the effects of the 2004 Olympics broadcasts and without the effects of the May 2005 SFAS 133 correction. We also believe that investors would find it useful to compare our operating cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, to the operating cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, without the impact of GECS dividends, which can vary from period-to-period. Similarly, we believe that investors would find it useful to compare our 2005 earnings from continuing operations with our 2004 earnings from continuing operations without the effects of the May 2005 SFAS 133 correction and the effects of the Genpact dispositions. We also believe that investors would find it useful to compare our financial services revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2005 with the revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2004, without the effects of the May 2005 SFAS 133 correction and the effects of the Genpact dispositions.
