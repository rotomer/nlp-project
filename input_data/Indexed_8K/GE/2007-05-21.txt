Item 8.01.  Other Events.
General Electric Company (the Company) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its GE Plastics business to Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), a global petrochemicals manufacturer, in a deal valued at $11.6 billion in cash plus assumption of liabilities.  GE Plastics is a $6.645 billion global supplier of plastic resins widely used in automotive, healthcare, consumer electronics, transportation, performance packaging, building and construction, telecommunications, and optical media. It is headquartered in Pittsfield, MA. and employs 10,300 people in 60 locations worldwide.
The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, and is targeted for the third quarter of 2007.  The Company will receive net after-tax proceeds from the sale of approximately $9 billion.  The Company intends to use the proceeds principally to re-launch its current stock buyback program, increasing the 2007 planned share repurchase from $6 billion to $7 to $8 billion. The sale will generate an approximate after-tax gain of $1.5 billion, which will be used to fund restructuring across GEs businesses and the share repurchase.  This Form 8-K shall be deemed filed for purposes of being incorporated by reference in the Companys registration statements.
