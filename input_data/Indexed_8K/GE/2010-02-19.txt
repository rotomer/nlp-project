Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
General Electric Company is furnishing this Form 8-K to provide revised unaudited summary segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and each of the quarters in 2009 and 2008, to reflect the results of our segment reorganization that became effective January 1, 2010.
Effective January 1, 2010, we reorganized our segments to better align our Consumer & Industrial and Energy businesses for growth. As a result of this reorganization, we created a new segment called Home & Business Solutions that includes the Appliances and Lighting businesses from our previous Consumer & Industrial segment and the retained portion of the GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms business of our previous Enterprise Solutions business (a business formerly within our Technology Infrastructure segment). In addition, the Industrial business of our previous Consumer & Industrial segment and the Sensing & Inspection Technologies and Digital Energy businesses of Enterprise Solutions are now part of the Energy business within the Energy Infrastructure segment. The Security business of Enterprise Solutions is now reported in GE Corporate Items and Eliminations pending its expected sale. Also, effective January 1, 2010, the Capital Finance segment was renamed GE Capital and includes all of the continuing operations of General Electric Capital Corporation.
As a result of this reorganization, our five operating segments as of January 1, 2010, are as follows:
 In this Form 8-K, we are providing prior-period reclassified segment information resulting from these organizational changes. GEs consolidated financial statements covering periods beginning on January 1, 2010 will reflect modifications to our previous reportable segments resulting from this reorganization, including reclassification of all comparative prior period segment information.
The information furnished pursuant to Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99, shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
