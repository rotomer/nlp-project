Item 1.01.   Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously announced on December 3, 2009, General Electric Company ("GE"), NBC Universal, Inc. ("NBCU") and Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") entered into a master agreement (the "Master Agreement") pursuant to which GE and Comcast will form a joint venture which will consist of the NBCU businesses and Comcast's cable networks. In connection with the joint venture transaction, NBCU obtained a commitment letter from various lenders to provide NBCU with $9.1 billion of financing (plus a $750 million revolving credit facility). On March 19, 2010, NBCU entered into definitive agreements providing the financing contemplated by the commitment letter. These agreements consist of (a) a three-year credit agreement (the "Three-Year Credit Agreement") and (b) a 364-day bridge loan agreement (the "Bridge Loan Agreement") with a syndicate of lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent.
  The Three-Year Credit Agreement provides a $3 billion term loan facility and a $750 million revolving facility to NBCU. When drawn, the proceeds of (a) the revolving loans will be used to pay fees and expenses in connection with the joint venture transaction and for other general corporate purposes and working capital of NBCU and its subsidiaries and (b) the term loans will be used for the same purposes as the revolving loans and to finance a portion of the distribution NBCU will make to GE in connection with the closing of the joint venture transaction.
.
Three-Year Credit Agreement
The lenders are obligated to fund under the Three-Year Credit Agreement on the date that certain conditions are met or waived (the "closing date"), including: (a) the closing of the joint venture transaction; (b) since January 1, 2009, there being no material adverse effect on NBCU and the businesses to be contributed by Comcast to the joint venture, taken as a whole; (c) a rating, taking into account the joint venture transaction, of at least Baa3 (with stable (or better) outlook) from Moody's and at least BBB- (with stable (or better) outlook) from S&P; and (d) a consolidated leverage ratio (based on the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA) not to exceed 4.85 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the joint venture transaction.
If the closing date under the Three-Year Credit Agreement has not occurred, the commitments of the lenders will automatically terminate on the earlier to occur of (a) the termination of the Master Agreement by the parties thereto and (b) December 3, 2010 (or such later date as the outside termination date after which either GE or Comcast can terminate the Master Agreement may be extended, but in any event no later than June 3, 2011). Each lender would need to agree to any extension beyond June 3, 2011.
The term loans and revolving loans generally will bear interest at a rate per annum based upon, at NBCU's option, the base rate or the Eurodollar rate, plus in each case, a ratings-based margin. If any bridge loans are borrowed under the Bridge Loan Agreement and remain outstanding, the interest rates under the Three-Year Credit Agreement will increase. NBCU will pay an unused commitment fee to the revolving lenders under the Three-Year Credit Agreement, commencing from the closing date of the Three-Year Credit Agreement, and prior to the closing date, NBCU will also pay a ticking fee to the term loan and revolving lenders based on the average daily amount of their commitments.
The term loans amortize over time and mature on the third anniversary of the closing date. The revolving facility matures on the third anniversary of the closing date, and such maturity date may be extended from time to time for up to two additional one-year periods at NBCU's request and with the revolving facility lenders' approval.
The Three-Year Credit Agreement includes customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, the administrative agent may (and upon request of the required lenders shall), terminate all
 
commitments and declare all unpaid loans, accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder immediately due and payable.
  The Bridge Loan Agreement provides a $6.1 billion bridge loan facility. The proceeds of the bridge loans will be used for the same purposes as the proceeds of the term loans under the Three-Year Credit Facility. The obligation of the lenders under the Bridge Loan Agreement to fund the bridge loans are generally subject to the same conditions as are applicable to the funding of the loans under the Three-Year Credit Agreement and the commitments of the lenders under the Bridge Loan Agreement generally are terminable under the same conditions as the commitments under the Three-Year Credit Agreement.
.
Bridge Loan Agreement
The bridge loans have interest rate and fee terms that generally are similar to those applicable to the term loans. In addition, NBCU will pay duration fees, increasing over time, based on the aggregate outstanding amount of the bridge loans. The bridge loans mature 364 days after the closing date of the Bridge Loan Agreement. The Bridge Loan Agreement requires a mandatory reduction of the bridge loan commitments if, on or after March 19, 2010 but prior to the closing date of the Bridge Loan Agreement, NBCU receives cash proceeds from certain asset sales, recovery events, equity issuances and debt issuances. The Bridge Loan Agreement requires a mandatory prepayment of the bridge loans if, on or after the closing date of the Bridge Loan Agreement, NBCU receives cash proceeds from certain asset sales, recovery events, equity issuances and debt issuances.
The Bridge Loan Agreement includes representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and remedies that generally are similar to (but in some cases more extensive than) those in the Three-Year Credit Agreement.
Certain of the agents and lenders under the Three-Year Credit Agreement and the Bridge Loan Agreement (and their affiliates) have various financing and other relationships with GE and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.

Unless the Administrative Agent notifies the applicable Issuing Lender that such Letter of Credit Action is not permitted hereunder, or the applicable Issuing Lender notifies the Administrative Agent that it has determined that such Letter of Credit Action is contrary to any Laws or policies of such Issuing Lender, the applicable Issuing Lender shall effect such Letter of Credit Action.

The obligation of each Revolving Lender to so reimburse such Issuing Lender shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default or any other occurrence or event; that such Issuing Lender shall not have a right to be so reimbursed in respect of a Letter of Credit if such Issuing Lender issued such Letter of Credit after being notified by the Administrative Agent that such issuance was not permitted hereunder.

(e) If the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.03 can be satisfied (except for the giving of a Request for Extension of Credit) on any date the Borrower is obligated to, but fails to, reimburse an Issuing Lender for a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the funding by the Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection (d) above shall be deemed to be a Borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans by the Borrower (without regard to the Minimum Amount therefor). If the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.03 (except for the giving of a Request for Extension of Credit) cannot be satisfied on the date the Borrower is obligated to, but fails to, reimburse an Issuing Lender for a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the funding by the Revolving Lenders pursuant to the previous subsection shall be deemed to be a funding by each Revolving Lender of its participation in such Letter of Credit, and each Revolving Lender making such funding shall thereupon acquire a pro rata participation, to the extent of its payment, in the claim of such Issuing Lender against the Borrower in respect of such payment and shall share, in accordance with that pro rata participation, in any payment made by the Borrower with respect to such claim. Any amounts made available by a Revolving Lender under its participation shall be payable by the Borrower upon demand of the Administrative Agent, and shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.
(f) The Borrower may request Letters of Credit that have automatic extension or renewal provisions ("evergreen" Letters of Credit), so long as the applicable Issuing Lender consents thereto and has the right not to permit any such extension or renewal at least annually within a notice period to be agreed upon at the time each such Letter of Credit is issued. Once an evergreen Letter of Credit is issued, unless the Administrative Agent has notified the applicable Issuing Lender that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or renewal, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) such Issuing Lender to permit the renewal of such evergreen Letter of Credit at any time to a date not later than five Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date (as it may be extended). Such Issuing Lender may elect not to permit an evergreen Letter of Credit to be extended or renewed at any time.

(iv) any demand, statement or any other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever so long as any such document appeared to comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;
(v) any payment by such Issuing Lender in good faith under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or any accompanying document which does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or any payment made by such Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidation, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws;
(vi) any error in the transmission of any message relating to such Letter of Credit not caused by such Issuing Lender, or any delay or interruption in any such message;

(l) Each Issuing Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, not later than the 20th day after each calendar quarter ending after the Effective Date, a written report, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, setting forth the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender
 
and outstanding as of the last day of such calendar quarter, any Letter of Credit Actions effected during such calendar quarter, and any draws made under such Letters of Credit during such calendar quarter.

To request Competitive Bids, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone not later than the Requisite Time therefor; that the Borrower may submit up to (but not more than) two Competitive Bid Requests on the same day, but no Competitive Bid Request or Requests shall be made within five Business Days after the date of any previous Competitive Bid Request or Requests, unless any and all such previous Competitive Bid Requests shall have been withdrawn or all Competitive Bids received in response thereto rejected. Each such telephonic Competitive Bid Request shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Competitive Bid Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Competitive Bid Request shall specify the following information:
provided

(i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing (which shall be at least the Minimum Amount therefor);
(ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

(iv) the Interest Period to be applicable to such Borrowing, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
Promptly following receipt of a Competitive Bid Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of the details thereof by telecopy, inviting the Revolving Lenders to submit Competitive Bids.
(b) Each Revolving Lender may (but shall not have any obligation to) make one or more Competitive Bids to the Borrower in response to a Competitive Bid Request.

Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially to the form approved by the Administrative Agent may be rejected by the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Revolving Lender as promptly as practicable. Each Competitive Bid shall specify (i) the principal amount (which shall be a minimum of $10,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and which may equal the entire principal amount of the Competitive Borrowing requested by the Borrower) of the Competitive Loan or Loans that the Lender is willing to make, (ii) the Competitive Bid Rate or Rates at which the Lender is prepared to make such
 
Loan or Loans (expressed as a percentage rate per annum in the form of a decimal to no more than four decimal places) and (iii) the Interest Period applicable to each such Loan and the last day thereof.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower by telecopy of the Competitive Bid Rate and the principal amount specified in each Competitive Bid and the identity of the Lender that shall have made such Competitive Bid.
(d) Subject only to the provisions of this subsection, the Borrower may accept or reject any Competitive Bid. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone, confirmed by telecopy in a form approved by the Administrative Agent, whether and to what extent it has decided to accept or reject each Competitive Bid, in the case of a Competitive Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans, not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Competitive Borrowing, and in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on the proposed date of the Competitive Borrowing; that (i) the failure of the Borrower to give such notice shall be deemed to be a rejection of each Competitive Bid, (ii) the Borrower shall not accept a Competitive Bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate if the Borrower rejects a Competitive Bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate with respect to the same Competitive Bid Request, (iii) the aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by the Borrower shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the requested Competitive Borrowing specified in the related Competitive Bid Request, (iv) to the extent necessary to comply with clause (iii) above, the Borrower may accept Competitive Bids at the same Competitive Bid Rate in part, which acceptance, in the case of multiple Competitive Bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such Competitive Bid and (v) except pursuant to clause (iv) above, no Competitive Bid shall be accepted for a Competitive Loan unless such Competitive Loan is in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000; that if a Competitive Loan must be in an amount less than $5,000,000 because of the provisions of clause (iv) above, such Competitive Loan may be for a minimum of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and in calculating the pro rata allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple Competitive Bids at a particular Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to clause (iv) the amounts shall be rounded to integral multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner determined by the Borrower. A notice given by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection shall be irrevocable.

(e) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each bidding Lender by telecopy whether or not its Competitive Bid has been accepted (and, if so, the amount and Competitive Bid Rate so accepted), and each successful bidder will thereupon become bound, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to make the Competitive Loan in respect of which its Competitive Bid has been accepted.
(f) If the Administrative Agent shall elect to submit a Competitive Bid in its capacity as a Lender, it shall submit such Competitive Bid directly to the Borrower at least one quarter of an hour earlier than the time by which the other Lenders are required to submit their Competitive Bids to the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section.

Reduction or Termination of Commitments
(a) Upon Requisite Notice to the Administrative Agent not later than the Requisite Time therefor, the Borrower may at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty, permanently and irrevocably reduce the Revolving Commitments, in a Minimum Amount therefor to an amount not less than the sum of the Outstanding Revolving Obligations at such time plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans at any time, or terminate the Revolving Commitments. Any such reduction or termination after the Effective Date shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued and unpaid commitment fees with respect to the portion of the Revolving
 
Commitments being reduced or terminated. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Revolving Lenders of any such request for reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments. Each Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment shall be reduced pro rata by the amount of such reduction.
(b) Upon Requisite Notice to the Administrative Agent not later than the Requisite Time therefor, the Borrower may at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty, permanently and irrevocably reduce the Term Commitments in a Minimum Amount therefor or terminate the Term Commitments. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Term Lenders of any such request for reduction or termination of the Term Commitments. Each Term Lender's Term Commitment shall be reduced pro rata by the amount of such reduction.
(c) If the Effective Date has not occurred, the Commitments shall be automatically terminated upon the earlier to occur of (i) the termination of the Master Agreement by the parties thereto and (ii) December 3, 2010 (or such later date as the "End Date" under the Master Agreement may be extended pursuant to Section 10.01(d) thereof, but in any event no later than June 3, 2011) unless, in the case of this clause (ii), each Lender shall, in its sole discretion, agree to an extension. Upon the termination of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.08(c), all accrued and unpaid ticking fees payable under Section 2.16(a) shall become immediately due and payable.

Prepayments of Loans
(a) Upon Requisite Notice to the Administrative Agent not later than the Requisite Time therefor, the Borrower may at any time and from time to time voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans or Term Loans made to it in part in the Minimum Amount therefor or in full without premium or penalty; that the Borrower may not prepay any Competitive Loan without the prior written consent of the Revolving Lender thereof. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof and of such Lender's percentage of such prepayment. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with the costs set forth in Section 3.05.
provided
(b) If for any reason the amount of the Outstanding Revolving Obligations of all Revolving Lenders plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Competitive Loans at any time exceeds the combined Revolving Commitments from time to time in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Revolving Loans and/or deposit cash in a Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.
(c) Prepayments of the Term Loans shall be applied to the remaining installments thereof (including the payment to be made on the Term Facility Maturity Date) as directed by the Borrower. Prepayments of the Term Loans may not be reborrowed.
2.13 .
Documentation of Loans
(a) Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, a Lender's Loans may be evidenced by one or more Notes of the Borrower, instead of or in addition to its loan accounts or records. Each such Lender may attach schedules to its Notes and endorse thereon the
 
date, amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. Any failure so to record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.
(b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain, at the Administrative Agent's Office, a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments and Extensions of Credit of each Lender from time to time as more fully described in subsection (c) (the "Register"). The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register, acting, solely for this administrative purpose only, as agent for the Borrower (it being acknowledged and agreed that the Administrative Agent and each Administrative Agent-Related Person, in such capacity, shall constitute Indemnitees under Section 10.13).
(c) The Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the Commitments and Extensions of Credit from time to time of each Lender, the amount of any principal or interest due and payable by the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, and the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower, whether such sum constitutes principal or interest (and the type of Loan to which it applies), fees, expenses or other amounts due under the Loan Documents and each Lender's share thereof, if applicable. Any recordation shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and each Lender, absent manifest error; , , that the failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Commitments or Outstanding Obligations or outstanding Competitive Loans.
provided
however
(d) Each Lender shall record on its internal loan accounts or records (and may record on the Note(s) held by such Lender) the amount of each Extension of Credit made by it and each payment in respect thereof; that the failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Commitments or Outstanding Obligations or outstanding Competitive Loans; and , , that in the event of any inconsistency between the Register and any Lender's records, the recordations in the Register shall govern, absent manifest error.
provided
provided
further
(e) The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall deem and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as the holders and owners of the corresponding Commitments and Extensions of Credit listed therein for all purposes hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any such Commitment or Extensions of Credit shall be effective, in each case, unless and until an Assignment and Acceptance effecting the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been accepted by the Administrative Agent and recorded in the Register. Prior to such recordation, all amounts owed with respect to the applicable Commitment or Outstanding Obligations or outstanding Competitive Loans shall be owed to the Lender listed in the Register as the owner thereof, and any request, authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, assignee or transferee of the corresponding Commitments or Outstanding Obligations or outstanding Competitive Loans.
2.14 .
Continuation and Conversion Option
(a) Subject to Section 2.14(d), the Borrower may irrevocably request a Conversion or Continuation of Loans on any Business Day in a Minimum Amount therefor by delivering a Request for Extension of Credit therefor by Requisite Notice to the Administrative Agent not later than the Requisite Time therefor. All Conversions and Continuations shall constitute Base Rate Loans unless properly and timely otherwise designated as set forth in the prior sentence.
 
(b) Unless the Borrower pays all amounts due under Section 3.05, if any, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be Continued or Converted only on the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may (and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall) prohibit Loans from being requested as, Converted into, or Continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans be Converted immediately into Base Rate Loans.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan upon determination of the same. The Administrative Agent shall from time to time notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in JPMorgan Chase's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Competitive Loans may not be Converted or Continued.
2.15 .
Interest
(a) Subject to subsection (b) below, and unless otherwise specified herein, the Borrower hereby promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made to it (before and after default, before and after maturity, before and after judgment and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws) from the date borrowed until paid in full (whether by acceleration or otherwise) on each Applicable Payment Date at a rate per annum equal to:
(i) in the case of Base Rate Loans, the Base Rate plus the Applicable Amount for such type of Loan;
(ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans (other than Competitive Loans), the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Amount for such type of Loan;
(iii) in the case of Competitive Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus (or minus, as the case may be) the Margin applicable to such Loan; and
(iv) in the case of Fixed Rate Loans, at the Fixed Rate applicable to such Loan.
(b) If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), the Borrower hereby promises to pay interest (after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by Law) on such amount at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be payable upon demand.
(c) On any Business Day, the Borrower may call the Administrative Agent and request information as to the then current Eurodollar Base Rate or Base Rate, and the Administrative Agent shall provide such information.
2.16 .
Fees
 
(a) . The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender pro rata according to its Aggregate Exposure Percentage a ticking fee equal to the average daily amount of such Lender's Commitments multiplied by the Ticking Fee Rate then in effect. The ticking fee shall accrue at all times from the Initial Effective Date until the earlier to occur of (i) the termination or expiration of the Commitments and (ii) the Effective Date, and shall be payable on such earlier date.
Ticking Fee
(b) . The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender pro rata according to its Revolving Percentage a commitment fee equal to the Applicable Amount multiplied by the average daily amount of the excess, if any, of its Revolving Commitment over its Outstanding Revolving Obligations (it being understood, for avoidance of doubt, that for purposes of the calculation of the commitment fee, Competitive Loans shall not be deemed to be a utilization of the Revolving Facility). The commitment fee shall accrue at all times from the Effective Date until the Revolving Termination Date (as it may be extended) and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Applicable Payment Date. If there is any change in the Applicable Amount during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Amount separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Amount was in effect. The commitment fee shall accrue at all applicable times, including at any time during which one or more conditions in Section 4 are not met.
Commitment Fee
(c) . The Borrower agrees to pay to the other parties hereto (and their respective Affiliates) fees in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in writing by the Borrower and such parties (or their Affiliates), except that any "ticking fee" payable pursuant to any such agreement with respect to the Commitments shall, from the Initial Effective Date, be replaced with the fee referred to in Section 2.16(a).
Other Fees
2.17 . Computation of interest on Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by JPMorgan Chase's "prime rate" shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed. Computation of all other types of interest and all fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.
Computation of Interest and Fees
provided
2.18 .
Making Payments
(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all payments by the Borrower or any Lender hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than the Requisite Time for such type of payment. All payments received after such Requisite Time shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of the calculation of interest and fees, but not for purposes of determining whether a Default has occurred. All payments of principal and interest shall be made in immediately available funds in Dollars. All payments by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
(b) Upon satisfaction of any applicable terms and conditions set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall promptly make any amounts received in accordance with Section 2.18(a) available in like funds received as follows: (i) if payable to the Borrower, by crediting a deposit account designated from time to time by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent by Requisite Notice, and (ii) if payable to any Lender, by wire transfer to such Lender at its Lending Office. If such conditions are not so satisfied, the Administrative Agent shall return any funds it is holding to the Lenders making such funds available, without interest.
 
(c) Subject to the definition of "Interest Period," if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall instead be considered due on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest and fees.
(d) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the Requisite Time any payment to be made by it is due, that it does not intend to remit such payment, the Administrative Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely remitted such payment and may, in its sole and absolute discretion and in reliance thereon, make such payment available to the Person entitled thereto. If such payment was not in fact remitted to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:
(i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the amount of such assumed payment made available to such Lender, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Rate; and
(ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent promptly shall notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to recover interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, (A) from such Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate and (B) from the Borrower, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Revolving Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
(e) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender is required at any time to return to the Borrower, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or any official under any proceeding under Debtor Relief Laws, any portion of a payment made by the Borrower, each Lender shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent, return its share of the amount to be returned, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.
2.19 . Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
Funding Sources
2.20 . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders
(a) Fees set forth in Section 2.16 shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitments of such Defaulting Lender;
 
(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any voluntary prepayment of Revolving Loans shall, if the Borrower so directs at the time of making such voluntary prepayment, be applied to the Revolving Loans of other Lenders as if such Defaulting Lender had no Revolving Loans outstanding and the Aggregate Exposure of such Defaulting Lender in respect of its Revolving Commitment were zero;
(c) The Aggregate Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 10.01), that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender and in any event, no such amendment, modification, or waiver shall increase the Commitments or the principal amount of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender, extend the maturity date applicable thereto or decrease the rate of interest (including any commitment fees) payable in respect thereof without the consent of such Defaulting Lender;
provided
(d) If any Letter of Credit Usage exists at the time a Revolving Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) all or any part of such Letter of Credit Usage shall be reallocated among the Revolving Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Percentages but, in any case, only to the extent (x) the sum of the Outstanding Revolving Obligations of all Revolving Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders plus such Defaulting Lender's ratable participation in all Letter of Credit Usage does not exceed the total of the Revolving Commitments of all Revolving Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 4.03 are satisfied at such time;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent, either (x) cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender's participation in all Letter of Credit Usage (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in a Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account for so long as such Letter of Credit is outstanding or (y) backstop such Letter of Credit Usage with a letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Lender;
(iii) if the Borrower cash collateralizes or backstops any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Usage pursuant to this subsection (d), the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.06(j) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Usage during the period such Defaulting Lender's Letter of Credit Usage is cash collateralized or backstopped;
(iv) if the Letter of Credit Usage attributable to the Defaulting Lenders that are Revolving Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this subsection (d), then the fees payable to the non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.16(b) and Section 2.06(j) shall be adjusted in accordance with the non-Defaulting Lenders' respective Revolving Percentages to account for such reallocation; and
(v) if any Defaulting Lender's participation in all Letter of Credit Usage is neither cash collateralized, backstopped nor reallocated pursuant to this subsection (d), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lenders or any Lender
 
hereunder, all Letter of Credit fees payable under Section 2.06(j) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's remaining participation in all Letter of Credit Usage shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Lenders until such participation in all Letter of Credit Usage is backstopped, cash collateralized and/or reallocated.
(e) So long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral or backstop letters of credit will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section, and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders that are Revolving Lenders in a manner consistent with subsection (d)(i) of this Section (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).
(f) In the event that each of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Issuing Lenders agree that a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Letter of Credit Usage of the Revolving Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such formerly Defaulting Lender's Revolving Commitment and on such date such formerly Defaulting Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Revolving Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such formerly Defaulting Lender to hold such Revolving Loans in accordance with its Revolving Percentage.
3.01 .
Taxes
(a) To the extent permitted by Law, any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any and all present or future income, stamp or other taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, (w) in the case of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on it, by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a Lending Office, (x) with respect to each Lender, taxes imposed by reason of any present or former connection between such Lender and the jurisdiction imposing such taxes, other than solely as a result of this Agreement or any Note or any transaction contemplated hereby, (y) in the case of a Lender organized under the Laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States (other than an assignee pursuant to a request by the Borrower under Section 3.06(b)), any withholding tax that is imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (or designates a new lending office) or is attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with Section 10.21, except to the extent that such Lender (or its assignor, if any) was entitled, at the time of designation of a new lending office (or assignment), to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such withholding tax pursuant to this Section and (z) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a failure by any Lender, Administrative Agent, or any other legal or beneficial holder or any foreign financial institution through which payments on the Loans under this Agreement are made to comply with any applicable certification, documentation, information or other reporting requirement concerning the nationality, residence, identity, direct or indirect ownership of or
 
investment in, or connection with the United States of America of the applicable Lender, Administrative Agent, or any other legal or beneficial holder or any foreign financial institution through which payments on the Loans under this Agreement are made if such compliance is required by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2009 (H.R. 3933, S. 1934) ("FATCA"), if and to the extent enacted, or under any other United States federal legislation, if and to the extent enacted, that is substantially similar to FATCA (including, for example, Title V, Subtitle A, Chapter 4 of the Tax Extenders Act of 2009 (H.R. 4213)) or any federal regulation promulgated or Revenue Ruling, Revenue Procedure, or Notice (to the extent such Notice provides formal, definitive guidance) issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service thereunder as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Non-Excluded Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Non-Excluded Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the Administrative Agent and such Lender receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions or withholdings, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (who shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
(b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made by it under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").
(c) If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the Administrative Agent or such Lender such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed.
(d) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, amounts payable under Section 3.01(c) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.

however
3.02 . If any Lender determines that any Laws have made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or materially restricts the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable offshore interbank market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, the obligation of such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or Convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender made to the Borrower, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
Illegality
3.03 . If, in connection with any Request for Extension of Credit involving any Eurodollar Rate Loan, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) deposits in Dollars are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore dollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of the requested Eurodollar Rate Loan or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the underlying interest rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (b) the Required Lenders (or, in the case of a Competitive Loan that is a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Lender that is required to make such Loan) determine that such underlying interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders (or the Lender) of funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and all Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders (or the Lender) to make or maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be suspended until the
Inability to Determine Eurodollar Rates
 
Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
3.04 .
Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy
(a) If any Lender determines that the adoption of any Law or any change in any Law or in the interpretation thereof effective after the date hereof:
(i) subjects such Lender to any duty or other charge (excluding taxes, Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes addressed in Section 3.01) with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans;
(ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement (other than the reserve requirement utilized in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, such Lender (including its Revolving Commitment); or
(iii) imposes on such Lender or on the offshore interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making, Converting into, Continuing, or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by such Lender under this Agreement with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans, then from time to time upon demand of the Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts attributable to the Borrower as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.
(b) If any Lender determines that the adoption of any Law or any change in any Law or in the interpretation thereof effective after the date hereof has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts attributable to the Borrower as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a Lender shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section in respect of any Competitive Loan if the adoption of or change in Law or in the interpretation thereof that would otherwise entitle it to such compensation shall have been publicly announced prior to submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.
3.05 . Subject to Section 3.06(a), upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any actual loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
Breakfunding Costs
 
(a) Any Continuation, Conversion, payment or prepayment by the Borrower of any Eurodollar Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration or otherwise);
(b) Any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Eurodollar Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loan) to prepay, borrow, Continue or Convert any Eurodollar Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
(c) Any failure by the Borrower to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to make such Loan;
excluding any loss of anticipated profits but including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
3.06 .
Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation
(a) A certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of clearly demonstrable error; that such certificate (i) sets forth with reasonable specificity the calculation of the amount to be paid, (ii) states that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, is treating substantially all similarly situated borrowers in a manner that is consistent with the treatment afforded the Borrower hereunder, (iii) is delivered within 90 days of the later of the date of the event giving rise to such compensation and the date the Administrative Agent or such Lender knew or, with the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the requirements for such compensation and (iv) confirms (in the case of a claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or Section 3.04) that either a change in the Administrative Agent's Office or Lending Office, as the case may be, of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, would not have eliminated the request for compensation or that such change would have been otherwise disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be. In determining the amount of such compensation, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
provided
(b) Upon any Lender becoming prohibited from making, maintaining or funding Eurodollar Rate Loans pursuant to Section 3.02, or upon any Lender making a claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or Section 3.04, the Borrower may remove and replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.22.

The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

such Test Period attributable to such assets; (ii) if at any time during such Test Period (or, in the case of any pro forma calculation required to be made pursuant hereto in respect of the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Material Acquisition, at any time during the period commencing on the first day of such Test Period and ending on the date such designation is made) the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary shall have made a Material Acquisition, Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, for such Test Period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the incurrence or assumption of any Indebtedness in connection therewith) as if such Material Acquisition (and the incurrence or assumption of any such Indebtedness) occurred on the first day of such Test Period; and (iii) if at any time during such Test Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such Test Period shall have entered into any Material Disposition or Material Acquisition that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above if made by the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary during such Test Period, Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, for such Test Period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Material Disposition or Material Acquisition occurred on the first day of such Test Period. For the purposes of this section, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a Material Disposition or Material Acquisition and the amount of income or earnings related thereto, the pro forma calculations shall be determined in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Comparable adjustments shall be made in connection with any determination of Consolidated EBITDA.

Documentation of Loans
(a) Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, a Lender's Loans may be evidenced by one or more Notes of the Borrower, instead of or in addition to its loan accounts or records. Each such Lender may attach schedules to its Notes and endorse thereon the date, amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. Any failure so to record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.
(b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain, at the Administrative Agent's Office, a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments and Extensions of Credit of each Lender from time to time as more fully described in subsection (c) (the "Register"). The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register, acting, solely for this administrative purpose only, as agent for the Borrower (it
 
being acknowledged and agreed that the Administrative Agent and each Administrative Agent-Related Person, in such capacity, shall constitute Indemnitees under Section 10.13).
(c) The Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the Commitments and Extensions of Credit from time to time of each Lender, the amount of any principal or interest due and payable by the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, and the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower, whether such sum constitutes principal or interest (and the type of Loan to which it applies), fees, expenses or other amounts due under the Loan Documents and each Lender's share thereof, if applicable.

Continuation and Conversion Option
(a) The Borrower may irrevocably request a Conversion or Continuation of Loans on any Business Day in a Minimum Amount therefor by delivering a Request for Extension of Credit therefor by Requisite Notice to the Administrative Agent not later than the Requisite Time therefor. All Conversions and Continuations shall constitute Base Rate Loans unless properly and timely otherwise designated as set forth in the prior sentence.
(b) Unless the Borrower pays all amounts due under Section 3.05, if any, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be Continued or Converted only on the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may (and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall) prohibit Loans from being requested as, Converted into, or Continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans be Converted immediately into Base Rate Loans.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan upon determination of the same. The Administrative Agent shall from time to time notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in
 
JPMorgan Chase's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.

(i) in the case of Base Rate Loans, the Base Rate plus the Applicable Amount for such type of Loan;
(ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Amount for such type of Loan;
(b) If any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), the Borrower hereby promises to pay interest (after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by Law) on such amount at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be payable upon demand.

The ticking fee shall accrue at all times from the Initial Effective Date until the earlier to occur of (i) the termination or expiration of the Commitments and (ii) the Effective Date, and shall be payable on such earlier date.
Ticking Fee
(b) . If the Loans have not been repaid in full in cash on or prior to:

(c) . The Borrower agrees to pay to the other parties hereto (and their respective Affiliates) fees in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in writing by the Borrower and such parties (or their Affiliates), except that any "ticking fee" payable pursuant to any such agreement with respect to the Commitments shall, from the Initial Effective Date, be replaced with the fee referred to in Section 2.13(a).
Other Fees
2.14 . Computation of interest on Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by JPMorgan Chase's "prime rate" shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed. Computation of all other types of interest and all fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.

Making Payments
(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all payments by the Borrower or any Lender hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than the Requisite Time for such type of payment. All payments received after such Requisite Time shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of the calculation of interest and fees, but not for purposes of determining whether a Default has occurred. All payments of principal and interest shall be made in immediately available funds in Dollars. All payments by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
(b) Upon satisfaction of any applicable terms and conditions set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall promptly make any amounts received in accordance with Section 2.15(a) available in like funds received as follows: (i) if payable to the Borrower, by crediting a deposit account designated from time to time by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent by Requisite Notice, and (ii) if payable to any Lender, by wire transfer to such Lender at its Lending Office. If such conditions are not so satisfied, the Administrative Agent shall return any funds it is holding to the Lenders making such funds available, without interest.
(c) Subject to the definition of "Interest Period," if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall instead be considered due on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest and fees.
(d) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the Requisite Time any payment to be made by it is due, that it does not intend to remit such payment, the Administrative Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely remitted such payment and may, in its sole and absolute discretion and in reliance thereon, make such payment available to the Person entitled thereto. If such payment was not in fact remitted to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:
(i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the amount of such assumed payment made available to such Lender, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Rate; and
 
(ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent promptly shall notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to recover interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, (A) from such Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate and (B) from the Borrower, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
(e) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender is required at any time to return to the Borrower, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or any official under any proceeding under Debtor Relief Laws, any portion of a payment made by the Borrower, each Lender shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent, return its share of the amount to be returned, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.
2.16 . Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

2.17 . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders
(a) Fees set forth in Section 2.13 shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitments of such Defaulting Lender;
(b) The Aggregate Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 10.01), that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender and in any event, no such amendment, modification or waiver shall increase the Commitments or the principal amount of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender, extend the maturity date applicable thereto or decrease the rate of interest (including any duration fees) payable in respect thereof without the consent of such Defaulting Lender.

Taxes
(a) To the extent permitted by Law, any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any and all present or future income,
 
stamp or other taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, (w) in the case of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on it, by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a Lending Office, (x) with respect to each Lender, taxes imposed by reason of any present or former connection between such Lender and the jurisdiction imposing such taxes, other than solely as a result of this Agreement or any Note or any transaction contemplated hereby, (y) in the case of a Lender organized under the Laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States (other than an assignee pursuant to a request by the Borrower under Section 3.06(b)), any withholding tax that is imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (or designates a new lending office) or is attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with Section 10.21, except to the extent that such Lender (or its assignor, if any) was entitled, at the time of designation of a new lending office (or assignment), to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such withholding tax pursuant to this Section and (z) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for a failure by any Lender, Administrative Agent, or any other legal or beneficial holder or any foreign financial institution through which payments on the Loans under this Agreement are made to comply with any applicable certification, documentation, information or other reporting requirement concerning the nationality, residence, identity, direct or indirect ownership of or investment in, or connection with the United States of America of the applicable Lender, Administrative Agent, or any other legal or beneficial holder or any foreign financial institution through which payments on the Loans under this Agreement are made if such compliance is required by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2009 (H.R. 3933, S. 1934) ("FATCA"), if and to the extent enacted, or under any other United States federal legislation, if and to the extent enacted, that is substantially similar to FATCA (including, for example, Title V, Subtitle A, Chapter 4 of the Tax Extenders Act of 2009 (H.R. 4213)) or any federal regulation promulgated or Revenue Ruling, Revenue Procedure, or Notice (to the extent such Notice provides formal, definitive guidance) issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service thereunder as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Non-Excluded Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Non-Excluded Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the Administrative Agent and such Lender receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions or withholdings, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (who shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
(b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made by it under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").
(c) If the Borrower shall be required to deduct or pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall also pay to the Administrative Agent or such Lender such additional amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the
 
after-tax yield (after factoring in all taxes, including taxes imposed on or measured by net income) that the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received if such Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed.
(d) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, amounts payable under Section 3.01(c) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.01, all obligations of the Borrower to any Lender under such Section 3.01 shall be subject to, and conditioned upon such Lender's compliance with its obligations, if any, under, Section 10.21.
(f) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender has received a refund from a relevant taxing or governmental authority in respect of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); , that in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay any or all of such refund to such Governmental Authority (a "Refund Repayment Requirement"), the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent or such Lender the full amount of such Refund Repayment Requirement (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority). If the Borrower becomes aware that the Administrative Agent or any Lender is entitled to receive a refund from a relevant taxing or governmental authority in respect of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01 and requests that the Administrative Agent or such Lender make a claim to such taxing authority or governmental authority for such refund, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall make such claim for such refund, , (i) the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent or Lender for any costs incurred by such Administrative Agent or Lender in connection with making such claim for such refund and (ii) if any refund is received pursuant to such request, such refund will be subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

If any Lender determines that any Laws have made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or materially restricts the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable offshore interbank market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, the obligation of such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the
Illegality
 
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or Convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender made to the Borrower, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
3.03 . If, in connection with any Request for Extension of Credit involving any Eurodollar Rate Loan, (a) the Administrative Agent determines that (i) deposits in Dollars are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore dollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of the requested Eurodollar Rate Loan or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the underlying interest rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (b) the Required Lenders determine that such underlying interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders (or the Lender) of funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and all Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders (or the Lender) to make or maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement (other than the reserve requirement utilized in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, such Lender (including its Commitment); or

Regardless of how a Lender may treat payments for the purpose of its own accounting, for the purpose of computing the Obligations hereunder, payments received during the existence of an Event of Default shall be applied first, to costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Lender (to the extent that each Lender has a right to reimbursement thereof pursuant to the Loan Documents), second, to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Obligations to and including the date of such application, third, to the payment of, or as cash collateral for, the unpaid principal of the Obligations, and fourth, to the payment of all other amounts (including fees) then owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents, in each case paid pro rata to each Lender in the same proportions that the aggregate Obligations owed to each Lender under the Loan Documents bear to the aggregate Obligations owed under the Loan Documents to all Lenders, without priority or preference among the Lenders.
9.01 . Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.
Appointment
9.02 . The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.

Delegation of Duties
9.03 . Neither any Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person's own gross negligence or
Exculpatory Provisions
 
willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrower or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of the Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower.
9.04 .
Reliance by the Administrative Agent
(a) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.
(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Sections 4.01 and 4.02, absent Requisite Notice by such Lender to the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each Lender shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent by the Administrative Agent to each Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender.
9.05 . The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.
Notice of Default
provided
9.06 . Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower or any affiliate of the Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders
 
any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any affiliate of the Borrower that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.
9.07 . The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentage in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentage immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
Indemnification
provided
9.08 . Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and its affiliates as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.
Agent in Its Individual Capacity
9.09 . The Administrative Agent may resign as the Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), Section 8.01(b) or Section 8.01(i) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "the Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as the Administrative Agent shall be
Successor Administrative Agent
 
terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of the former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as the Administrative Agent by the date that is 30 days following the retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as the Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

(e) No payment or payments made by the Borrower, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments (other than payments made by such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations or payments received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations), remain liable for the Obligations up to the maximum liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated.

The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall notify such Guarantor promptly of any such set-off and the application made by the Administrative Agent or such Lender of the proceeds thereof, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of the Administrative Agent and each Lender under this Section 4 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which the Administrative Agent or such Lender may have.
Set-Off
5. . Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by any of the Guarantors hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of any of the Guarantors by any Lender, no Guarantor shall be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by any Lender for the payment of the Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Borrower or any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Borrower on account of the Obligations (other than contingent expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations) are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations (other than contingent expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations) shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine.
No Subrogation
6. . Each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by such party and any of the Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part

Each Guarantor understands and agrees that this Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrower against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Borrower or such Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for the Obligations, or of such Guarantor under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or any such other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve such Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against such Guarantor.
