NEW YORKMonday, September 27, 2010  General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) today announced that its subsidiary, NBC Universal, Inc., priced an offering of $5.1 billion aggregate principal amount of NBC Universals senior unsecured notes. The notes consist of the following tranches:
 
 
 
The issuance of the notes is part of the $9.1 billion of financing raised by NBC Universal in connection with the previously announced combination of NBC Universal with Comcast Corporations national cable networks, regional cable networks and certain digital media assets. The proceeds of the offering will be transferred to GE as an intercompany loan. Upon the closing of the GE-Comcast transaction this loan will be repaid and the proceeds will be used to make a cash distribution to GE. If the GE-Comcast transaction has not closed before June 10, 2011 or such earlier date as the master agreement governing that transaction is terminated, then NBC Universal has agreed to redeem all of the notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes (plus accrued and unpaid interest). These notes replace $5 .1 billion that would otherwise have been borrowed by NBC Universal under the bridge loan and term loan agreements it entered into as part of the $9.1 billion of financing for the GE-Comcast transaction.
 
 
The notes will be sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A, and outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws and may not be offered or sold by holders thereof without registration unless an exemption from such registration is available.
