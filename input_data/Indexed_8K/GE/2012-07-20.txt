PRESS RELEASE
 
 
GE [NYSE: GE] announced today second-quarter 2012 Operating Earnings of $4.0 billion, or $0.38 per share, up 7% and 12% respectively from the second-quarter of 2011.   GAAP earnings from continuing operations (attributable to GE) were $3.7 billion, up 2%, or $0.34 per share, up 3%.  Revenues were $36.5 billion for the quarter, up 2%.  Industrial segment revenue grew by 9%, with organic growth of 10%.  The strength of GEs Industrial portfolio was underscored by strong segment profit increases in Energy, Oil & Gas and Transportation.  The company is performing well and is on track to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2012 for both Industrial and GE Capital segments.
FAIRFIELD, Conn.  July 20, 2012 
Todays results demonstrate that we are executing on our growth strategy in the midst of a still volatile global economy, said GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt.  GE Capitals strong operating performance and capital position allowed it to return a $3 billion dividend to the parent, and our Industrial segments delivered another quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth.  Our strategy to invest in growth markets is paying off, as we achieved orders expansion in growth markets of 14% and revenue growth of 17%.  We ended the quarter with a record backlog.
Infrastructure orders were $23.1 billion, down 1% primarily driven by a 37% decrease in orders for wind turbines.  Orders were up 8% on a year-to-date basis.  Total orders performance included: Aviation up 5% and Transportation up 2%. Orders for the quarter included: GE Transportation orders for 176 locomotives from railroad customers in North America, up 28% from second-quarter 2011. In Australia, GE Energy is

supplying 5 Frame 6B gas turbines, 3 SC4 single-flow steam turbines and 5 heat recovery generators to provide 500 megawatts of installed power capacity for a combined cycle power plant for the Ichthys liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.  It will enable the facility to produce more than 8 million tons of LNG each year.  In Russia, GE Energy signed a deal with REP Holding for the assembly of 28 GE MS 5002E gas turbines.
Total revenues for the quarter were $36.5 billion, up 2%.  Revenues were negatively impacted by $0.9 billion due to FX and further shrinkage of our GE Capital business.  GEs second-quarter Industrial segment revenues were $25.0 billion, up 9%.  Industrial segment organic revenues were up 10% for the quarter.  Industrial growth market revenues were up 17%, driven by double-digit growth in Australia, Canada, China, Latin America, the Middle East/North Africa, Southeast Asia and Russia.
Industrial segment profit was up 7% to $3.7 billion and segment operating profits were strong in Energy Infrastructure and Transportation, up 13% and 58%, respectively.  In addition, pricing on orders was up 1.2% in total with higher prices in 4 out of 5 businesses.  Energy Infrastructure pricing was up 1.8%.  Cash generated from operating activities was up 55% at $6.8 billion.  GE ended the quarter with $74 billion of consolidated cash and cash equivalents.
Immelt concluded, Our Industrial outlook remains positive.  Margins have stabilized and Energy, Oil & Gas, and Transportation performed very well with double-digit profit increases.  We are confident in our double-digit EPS growth expectations for 2012 and are raising our operating cash expectations to $17-19 billion based upon the restart of the GE Capital dividend.
Second-quarter Highlights:
were $4.0 billion, up 7% from second quarter 2011 and operating EPS was $0.38, up 12% from $0.34 in the second quarter of last year.  GAAP earnings from continuing operations (attributable to GE) were $3.7 billion, up 2%, or $0.34 per share, up 3% from the second quarter of 2011.
Second-quarter operating earnings
Including the effects of discontinued operations, second-quarter net earnings attributable to GE were $3.1 billion ($0.29 per share attributable to common shareowners) in 2012 compared with $3.7 billion ($0.35 per share attributable to common shareowners) in the second quarter of 2011.  Discontinued Operations included $0.05 per share of charges primarily related to WMC and GE Money Japan reserve adjustments.  Positive one-time tax items of $0.02 per share were offset by $0.02 per share of restructuring and other charges.
increased 2% to $36.5 billion.  Industrial sales of $25.1 billion increased 9% versus the second quarter of 2011. GE Capital (GECC) revenues of $11.5 billion decreased 8% from last year, driven by lower assets in-line with plan.

We sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered non-GAAP financial measures under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure. We have referred to operating earnings, operating earnings per share (EPS), Industrial segment organic revenue growth and cash generated from Industrial operating activities (Industrial CFOA). The reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures follow.
Operating earnings excludes non-service related pension costs of our principal pension plans comprising interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/losses. The service cost and prior service cost components of our principal pension plans are included in operating earnings. We believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees. As such, we believe that our measure of operating earnings provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of our business. Other components of GAAP pension cost are mainly driven by market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. Neither GAAP nor operating pension costs are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to our pension plan. We also believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding GAAP measure, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies.

Organic revenue growth measures revenue excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates.  We believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends.  We also believe that presenting organic revenue growth separately for our industrial businesses provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other non-financial businesses and companies.  Management recognizes that the term "organic revenue growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. Although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.
We define Industrial CFOA as GEs cash from operating activities less the amount of dividends received by GE from GECC. This includes the effects of intercompany transactions, including GE customer receivables sold to GECC; GECC services for trade receivables management and material procurement; buildings and equipment (including automobiles) leased by GE from GECC; information technology (IT) and other services sold to GECC by GE; aircraft engines manufactured by GE that are installed on aircraft purchased by GECC from third-party producers for lease to others; and various investments, loans and allocations of GE corporate overhead costs. We believe that investors may find it useful to compare GEs operating cash flows without the effect of GECC dividends, since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from period to period based upon the results of the financial services businesses. Management recognizes that this measure may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies which contain both industrial and financial services businesses, but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the GECC cash flows. We believe that our measure of Industrial CFOA provides management and investors with a useful measure to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flow with the operating cash flow of other non-financial businesses and companies and as such provides a useful measure to supplement the reported GAAP CFOA measure.
