Product Sales
Product sales increased 11 percent to $2.07 billion for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $1.87 billion in the third quarter of 2010. This increase in sales was driven primarily by Gilead's antiviral franchise, due to strong growth in sales of Atripla (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) and Truvada (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg).

Sales of Atripla for the treatment of HIV infection increased 7 percent to $794.7 million for the third quarter of 2011, up from $742.7 million in the third quarter of 2010, driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe and the United States.
 
Sales of Truvada for the treatment of HIV infection increased 11 percent to $744.7 million for the third quarter of 2011, up from $668.7 million in the third quarter of 2010, driven primarily by sales volume growth in Europe and the United States.
 
Sales of Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for the treatment of HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B increased 5 percent to $192.9 million for the third quarter of 2011, up from $184.3 million in the third quarter of 2010. Sales increases in Europe and the United States were partially offset by lower sales in Latin America.
 
 
 
Sales of our newest product, Complera (emtricitabine 200 mg/rilpilvirine 25 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) for the treatment of HIV infection, were $19.0 million for the third quarter of 2011. On August 10, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Complera, a new once-daily, complete single-tablet HIV treatment regimen for treatment-nave adults.

Sales of Letairis (ambrisentan) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension increased 31 percent to $79.0 million for the third quarter of 2011, up from $60.4 million for the third quarter of 2010, driven primarily by sales volume growth.
Ranexa
Sales of Ranexa (ranolazine) for the treatment of chronic angina increased 36 percent to $82.0 million for the third quarter of 2011, up from $60.3 million for the third quarter of 2010, driven primarily by sales volume growth.

P. aeruginosa
Royalty, Contract and Other Revenues
Royalty, contract and other revenues from collaborations were $55.8 million in the third quarter of 2011, down 23 percent from $72.1 million in the third quarter of 2010. This decrease was due to an 89 percent decrease in Tamiflu royalties from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd to $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2011 from $34.5 million in the third quarter of 2010, as pandemic planning initiatives worldwide have declined.
Research and Development
Research and development (R&D) expenses in the third quarter of 2011 were $290.1 million, compared to $230.4 million for the third quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2011, which exclude acquisition-related, restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses, were $269.3 million, compared to $203.2 million for the third quarter of 2010. The increase in non-GAAP R&D expenses was due primarily to increased clinical activities and expenses associated with acquisitions and collaborations.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the third quarter of 2011 were $295.9 million, compared to $250.6 million for the third quarter of 2010.

The increase in non-GAAP SG&A expenses was driven primarily by the impact of the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from U.S. healthcare reform, expansion of commercial activities and legal expenses.
Net Foreign Currency Exchange Impact
The net foreign currency exchange impact on third quarter 2011 revenues and pre-tax earnings, which includes revenues and expenses generated from outside the United States, was a favorable $19.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2010.

Forward-looking Statements
Statements included in this press release that are not historical in nature are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Gilead cautions readers that forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include: Gilead's ability to achieve its anticipated full year 2011 financial results, including the possibility that its full year 2011 guidance may be revised at a later date; Gilead's ability to sustain growth in revenues for its antiviral, cardiovascular and respiratory franchises; unpredictable variability of Tamiflu royalties and the strong relationship between this royalty revenue and global pandemic planning and supply; the availability of funding for state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) and their ability to purchase at levels to support the number of patients that rely on ADAPs; the levels of inventory held by wholesalers and retailers which may cause fluctuations in Gilead's earnings; Gilead's ability to submit New Drug Applications for new product candidates in the timelines currently anticipated, including for elvitegravir and cobicistat; Gilead's ability to receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all, for new and current products, including the Quad; Gilead's ability to successfully commercialize its products, including the risk that physicians may not see advantages of Complera over other therapies and may therefore be reluctant to prescribe the product; Gilead's ability to successfully develop its respiratory, cardiovascular and oncology franchises; safety and efficacy data from clinical studies may not warrant further development of Gilead's product candidates; initiating and completing clinical trials may take longer or cost more than expected; the potential for additional austerity measures in European countries that may increase the amount of discount required on Gilead's products; fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the U.S. dollar that may cause an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact on Gilead's future revenues and pre-tax earnings; Gilead's ability to complete the $5.00 billion share repurchase program due to changes in its stock price, corporate or other market conditions; and other risks identified from time to time in Gilead's reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Gilead makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Gilead bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. You are urged to consider statements that include the words "may," "will," "would," "could," "should," "might," "believes," "estimates," "projects," "potential," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "intends," "continues," "forecast," "designed," "goal," or the negative of those words or other comparable words to be uncertain and forward-looking. Gilead directs readers to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 and other subsequent disclosure documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and press releases. Gilead claims the protection of the Safe Harbor contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
