Net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $665.1 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, compared to $629.4 million, or $0.76 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2011, which excludes after-tax acquisition-related, restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses, was $743.1 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to $779.3 million, or $0.95 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010.

For 2011, product sales increased 10 percent to $8.10 billion compared to $7.39 billion in 2010. This increase in product sales was driven primarily by Gilead's antiviral franchise, resulting from continued growth in sales of Atripla (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) and Truvada (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Complera, a new once-daily, single-tablet complete HIV treatment regimen for patients new to therapy in August 2011.

Other Products
Sales of other products were $151.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $150.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and included AmBisome (amphotericin B) liposome for injection, Hepsera (adefovir dipivoxil), Emtriva (emtricitabine) and Cayston (aztreonam for inhalation solution). For 2011, sales of other products increased 2 percent to $612.7 million from $601.1 million in 2010.

For 2011, royalty, contract and other revenues were $283.0 million, down 49 percent from $559.5 million in 2010, primarily due to lower Tamiflu royalties from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd as pandemic planning initiatives worldwide have declined.
Research and Development
Research and development (R&D) expenses in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $402.2 million, compared to $392.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2011, which exclude acquisition-related, restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses, were $349.3 million, compared to $231.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.

The increase in non-GAAP R&D expenses was due primarily to increased clinical activities and expenses associated with acquisitions, collaborations and continued advancements of our clinical pipeline.
 
 
 
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $346.2 million, compared to $280.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2011, which exclude acquisition-related, restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses, were $289.9 million, compared to $239.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, SG&A expenses were $1.24 billion compared to $1.04 billion in 2010. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for 2011 were $1.09 billion compared to $912.6 million in 2010. The increase in non-GAAP SG&A expenses was driven primarily by the impact of the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from the U.S. healthcare reform, increased expenses associated with the ongoing growth of Gilead's business, and increased bad debt expense due to slower collections in certain Southern European countries.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for 2011 was 23.6 percent compared to 26.2 percent for 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower state taxes and the geographic mix of product sales, partially offset by the impact of the U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax.
Net Foreign Currency Exchange Impact
The net foreign currency exchange impact on fourth quarter 2011 revenues and pre-tax earnings was an unfavorable $21.2 million and $22.1 million, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The net foreign currency exchange impact on full year 2011 revenues and pre-tax earnings was a favorable $21.4 million and an unfavorable $18.6 million, respectively, compared to 2010.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
As of December 31, 2011, Gilead had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $9.96 billion compared to $5.32 billion as of December 31, 2010, which included the proceeds from $3.70 billion of investment grade bonds raised to partially fund the Pharmasset, Inc. (Pharmasset) acquisition. Gilead generated $3.64 billion of operating cash flow in 2011 of which $978.1 million was generated in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Product and Pipeline Update
Antiviral Franchise
In October, Gilead announced that it submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for marketing approval of the "Quad", a complete single-tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults.

In November, Gilead announced positive five-year data from the open-label phase of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (Studies 102 and 103) evaluating the efficacy of Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection among primarily treatment-nave patients.

In December, Gilead announced Phase 3 clinical trial results showing that cobicistat, which increases blood levels of certain HIV medicines to allow for one-pill, once-daily dosing, met its 48-week primary objective of non-inferiority to ritonavir. These data have been submitted for presentation at a scientific conference in 2012.
Also in December, Phase 3 clinical trial results showing that elvitegravir, an integrase inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, was non-inferior to the integrase inhibitor raltegravir after two years (96 weeks) of therapy in treatment-experienced patients.

Gilead also announced in December that the submission of a supplemental NDA (sNDA) to the FDA for the approval of once-daily Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection among uninfected adults.
