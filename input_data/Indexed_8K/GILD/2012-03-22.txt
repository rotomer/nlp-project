Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On January 17, 2012, Gilead Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Gilead"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing that Gilead and Royal Merger Sub II, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead ("Purchaser"), completed a cash tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset, Inc. ("Pharmasset") by accepting for payment all shares of Pharmasset common stock validly tendered and not withdrawn on January 12, 2012. On January 17, 2012, Gilead caused Purchaser to merge with and into Pharmasset, pursuant to which Pharmasset became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead, and all outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset, other than (i) shares of common stock of Pharmasset owned by Gilead, Purchaser or any of their direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, (ii) shares of common stock of Pharmasset owned by Pharmasset or its subsidiary and (iii) shares of common stock of Pharmasset held by Pharmasset stockholders who properly demanded appraisal for their shares under Delaware law, were canceled and converted into the right to receive cash equal to the $137 price per share.
Item 9.01(a) and (b) of the Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 17, 2012 did not include the historical financial statements of Pharmasset or the unaudited pro forma combined financial information of Gilead (collectively, the Financial Information), and instead contained an undertaking subsequently to file the Financial Information. This amendment is being filed for the purpose of satisfying Gilead's undertaking to file the Financial Information required by Item 9.01(a) and (b) of Form 8-K, and this amendment should be read in conjunction with the initial report on Form 8-K.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
The audited financial statements of Pharmasset as of September 30, 2011 and 2010, and for each of the three years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 6, 2011 and are incorporated by reference herein.
 
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information of Gilead and Pharmasset as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2011 giving effect to Gilead's acquisition of Pharmasset are filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A and are incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT LIST
 
 

Exhibit 12.1
 

Exhibit 99.2
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements presented below are based on, and should be read in conjunction with (i) the historical consolidated financial statements for Gilead Sciences, Inc. ("Gilead") included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011; and (ii) the historical financial statements of Pharmasset, Inc. ("Pharmasset") included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2011. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet and statement of income give effect to the acquisition of Pharmasset, as if it had occurred on December 31, 2011 for balance sheet purposes and on January 1, 2011 for income statement purposes.
The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the merger, (2) factually supportable and (3) with respect to the statement of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company's financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the acquisition been completed as of the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not purport to project the future financial position or operating results of the combined company.
 
 
1. Description of Transaction
On November 21, 2011, Gilead and Pharmasset announced that the companies had signed a definitive agreement under which Gilead would acquire Pharmasset for $137.00 per share in cash through a tender offer (the "Acquisition"). On January 12, 2012, Gilead completed the tender offer for all outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmasset. On January 17, 2012, Pharmasset became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead. Gilead financed the Acquisition with approximately $5.1 billion in cash on hand, $3.7 billion in senior unsecured notes issued in December 2011 and $2.2 billion in bank debt issued in January 2012.
2. Basis of Presentation
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the historical financial statements of Gilead as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2011 and Pharmasset as of, and for the year ended, September 30, 2011. For ease of reference, no adjustments were made to Pharmasset's reported information for its different year-end date. Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical financial statements of Pharmasset to conform with Gilead's presentation, primarily related to the presentation of prepaid assets, other non-current assets and deferred rent.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total consideration transferred of $11.0 billion is to be allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Pharmasset based on their estimated fair values. Management has made a preliminary allocation of the consideration transferred to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on various estimates. The acquisition accounting is dependent upon certain valuations that are currently in progress. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments included in this document are preliminary, have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma combined financial information and may be revised as additional information becomes available or as additional analyses are performed.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not reflect any cost savings, operating synergies or revenue enhancements that the combined company may achieve as a result of the Acquisition, the costs to integrate the operations of Gilead and Pharmasset or the costs necessary to achieve these cost savings, operating synergies and revenue enhancements.
3. Accounting Policies
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not assume any differences in accounting policies. Gilead is not aware of any differences that would have a material impact on the pro forma combined financial statements.
4. Consideration Transferred
A preliminary estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by Gilead for this Acquisition, reconciled to the total consideration transferred is shown below (in thousands):
5. Pro Forma Adjustments
For purposes of preparing these unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, we included the following adjustments:
Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pro Forma Combined Statement of Income for the Year Ended December 31, 2011
 
 
 
The debt instruments issued to fund the Acquisition are a combination of $3.7 billion of fixed rate senior unsecured notes and $2.2 billion of floating rate bank debt. The fixed rate senior unsecured notes were issued in December 2011 and have maturity dates ranging from 3 to 30 years and fixed annual interest rates ranging from 2.40% to 5.65%. The floating rate bank debt was issued in January 2012 and will bear interest at either (i) the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or (ii) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the related credit agreements. The estimated weighted-average interest rate associated with this bank debt is 1.49%. A change of 1/8 of a percent (0.125%) in the interest rates assumed for these floating rate debt instruments would result in a $2.1 million change in pro forma interest expense.
 
Forward-looking Statements
These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate" and similar expressions. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the
Acquisition, including future financial and operating results, Gilead's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the possibility that expected synergies from the Acquisition will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; disruption from the Acquisition making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; Gilead's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; dependence on the effectiveness of patents and other protections for innovative products; Gilead's ability to advance the product pipeline; risks of unfavorable results from clinical trials, including GS-7977; Gilead's ability to develop an all-oral antiviral regimen for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) infected genotype 1 patients or pangenotypic regimen for all HCV patients; the risk of new and changing regulation and health policies in the United States and internationally and the exposure to litigation and/or regulatory actions. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements in the "Risk Factors" section of Gilead's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and other subsequent filings with the SEC available at the SEC's Internet site (http://www.sec.gov).
