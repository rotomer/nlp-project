Product sales increased
19 percent
to
$2.21 billion
for the first quarter of 2012 compared to
$1.86 billion
for the first quarter of 2011. This increase in product sales was driven primarily by Gilead's antiviral franchise, resulting from increased sales of Atripla
(efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) and Truvada
(emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), and the launch of Complera

18 percent
to
$1.93 billion
for the first quarter of 2012, up from
$1.63 billion
for the same quarter of 2011, reflecting sales growth of

Royalty, contract and other revenues from collaborations were
$74.1 million
for the first quarter of 2012, up

percent from
$62.5 million
for the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to an increase in other royalty revenues, which included higher royalties from GlaxoSmithKline Inc. for Volibris

compared to

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the first quarter of 2012 were
$443.1 million

$307.7 million
compared to

for the first quarter of 2011. The increase in non-GAAP SG&A expenses was due primarily to increased expenses to support the ongoing growth of Gilead's business and an increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax.
Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest expense for the first quarter of 2012 was
$97.3 million
compared to
$41.2 million
for the first quarter of 2011. The increase was due primarily to the additional debt Gilead issued in connection with its acquisition of Pharmasset.

The change was due primarily to a $40.1 million loss resulting from the Greek government's debt restructuring.
Net Foreign Currency Exchange Impact

$16.4 million
and
$16.2 million
, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2011.

As of March 31, 2012, Gilead had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of
$1.50 billion
compared to

Other Corporate Highlights
In January, Gilead announced that Roy D. Baynes, MD, PhD, joined the company as Senior Vice President, Oncology Therapeutics. Dr. Baynes reports to Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer and is responsible for Gilead's R&D efforts in oncology and inflammation.
Product and Pipeline Update
Antiviral Franchise
In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Viread in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients ages 2-12. The FDA approved three lower-strength once-daily tablets of Viread in doses of 150 mg, 200 mg and 250 mg for children ages 6-12. The agency also approved an oral powder formulation of Viread for children ages 2-5.
Also in January, Gilead announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating GS-7340 for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-nave adults. GS-7340 is a novel prodrug of tenofovir, the active agent in Viread. The Phase 2 study is evaluating GS-7340 as part of a once-daily, co-formulated single-tablet regimen that also contains Gilead's investigational boosting agent cobicistat, the investigational integrase inhibitor elvitegravir, and Emtriva. The GS-7340-containing single-tablet regimen is being compared to Gilead's Quad single-tablet regimen, which contains Viread, Emtriva, elvitegravir and cobicistat. Quad is currently under review for marketing approval by U.S. and European regulatory agencies.
In February, the FDA accepted Gilead's supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for once-daily Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection among uninfected adults. The sNDA was granted a six-month Priority Review with a target review date of June 15th
under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act.

Also in February, Gilead announced that the majority of hepatitis C genotype 1 patients with a prior null response to an interferon-containing regimen enrolled in the ongoing ELECTRON study experienced viral relapse within four weeks of completing 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 plus ribavirin. These data were presented at the 19
th
Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2012).
Lastly, in March, Gilead announced full Phase 3 clinical trial results from pivotal Studies 102 and 103 evaluating the Quad regimen versus Atripla among HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-nave adults. Study 102 demonstrated that Quad is non-inferior to Atripla after 48 weeks of therapy among HIV-1 infected treatment-nave adults. Study 103 determined that Quad was non-inferior to a protease-based regimen of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada at 48 weeks of therapy also among HIV-1 infected treatment-nave adults. Both data sets were presented at CROI 2012.

Forward-looking Statements
Statements included in this press release that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Gilead cautions readers that forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include: Gilead's ability to sustain growth in revenues for its antiviral, cardiovascular and respiratory franchises; unpredictable variability of Tamiflu royalties and the strong relationship between this royalty revenue and global pandemic planning and supply; the availability of funding for state ADAPs and their ability to purchase at levels to support the number of patients that rely on ADAPs; the levels of inventory held by wholesalers and retailers which may cause fluctuations in Gilead's earnings; Gilead's ability to submit NDAs for new product candidates in the timelines currently anticipated, including GS-7977 for the treatment of HCV; Gilead's ability to receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all, for new and current products, including Quad or Truvada for PrEP to reduce the risk of HIV infection; Gilead's ability to successfully commercialize its products, including Complera/Eviplera and Viread for pediatric use; Gilead's ability to successfully develop its respiratory, cardiovascular and oncology franchises; safety and efficacy data from clinical studies may not warrant further development of Gilead's product candidates, including GS-7340 for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; the potential for additional austerity measures in European countries that may increase the amount of discount required on Gilead's products; fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the U.S. dollar that may cause an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact on Gilead's future revenues and pre-tax earnings; Gilead's ability advance Pharmasset's product pipeline or develop an all-oral antiviral regimen for HCV; the effects of the Pharmasset acquisition on relationships with employees and the risk that anticipated synergies and benefits will not be realized; and other risks identified from time to time in Gilead's reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Gilead makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Gilead bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. You are urged to consider statements that include the words may, will, would, could, should, might, believes, estimates, projects, potential, expects, plans, anticipates, intends, continues, forecast, designed, goal, or the negative of those words or other comparable words to be uncertain and forward-looking. Gilead directs readers to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and other subsequent disclosure documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and press releases. Gilead claims the protection of the Safe Harbor contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Gilead, and Gilead assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
