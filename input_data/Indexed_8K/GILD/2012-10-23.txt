Forward-looking Statements
Statements included in this press release that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Gilead cautions readers that forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include: Gilead's ability to achieve its anticipated full year 2012 financial results; Gilead's ability to sustain growth in revenues for its antiviral, cardiopulmonary and respiratory franchises; the availability of funding for state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs) and their ability to purchase at levels to support the number of patients that rely on ADAPs; continued fluctuations in ADAP purchases driven by federal and state grant cycles which may not mirror patient demand and may cause fluctuations in Gilead's earnings; the possibility of unfavorable results from additional arms of the ATOMIC, ELECTRON and QUANTUM studies and subsequent clinical trials involving GS-7977 and ribavirin and GS-7977 plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin; the levels of inventory held by wholesalers and retailers which may cause fluctuations in Gilead's earnings; Gilead's ability to submit new drug applications for new product candidates in the timelines currently anticipated, including GS-7977 for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV); Gilead's ability to receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all, for new and current products, including cobicistat or elvitegravir; Gilead's ability to successfully commercialize its products, including Complera/Eviplera and Stribild; Gilead's ability to successfully develop its respiratory, cardiopulmonary and oncology franchises; safety and efficacy data from clinical studies may not warrant further development of Gilead's product candidates, including GS-7977; the potential for additional austerity measures in European countries that may increase the amount of discount required on Gilead's products; fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the U.S. dollar that may cause an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact on Gilead's future revenues and pre-tax earnings; Gilead's ability to advance Pharmasset's product pipeline or develop an all-oral antiviral regimen for HCV; and other risks identified from time to time in Gilead's reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Gilead makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Gilead bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. You are urged to consider statements that include the words may, will, would, could, should, might, believes, estimates, projects, potential, expects, plans, anticipates, intends, continues, forecast, designed, goal, or the negative of those words or other comparable words to be uncertain and forward-looking.
