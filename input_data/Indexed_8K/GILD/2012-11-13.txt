Section 7 - REGULATION FD
On November 12, 2012, at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Liver Meeting 2012, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company presented data from its Phase 2 study evaluating Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s sofosbuvir (also known as GS-7977) in combination with daclatasvir, an investigational NS5A inhibitor, with and without ribavirin, for 12 weeks in gentotype 1 treatment-nave HCV infected patients. The data showed that 96% (79 of 82) of genotype 1-treatment-nave HCV infected patients achieved a sustained viral response four weeks (SVR-4) after the completion of a 12 week course of treatment of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, with or without ribavirin. Of the three patients not achieving an SVR-4, all three subsequently achieved an SVR-12.
