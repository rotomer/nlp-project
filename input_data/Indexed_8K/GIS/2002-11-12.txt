ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On October 28, 2002, General Mills, Inc. (the "Company") completed its previously announced public offering of $2,233,305,000 principal amount at maturity of zero coupon convertible senior debentures due 2022, which included the exercise by the Initial Purchasers of their $223,330,000 overallotment option. The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the Company's short-term indebtedness that was incurred in connection with the acquisition of The Pillsbury Company in October 2001. The proceeds from the debenture offering aggregated approximately $1,329,000,000 after payment of underwriting discounts and expenses. The debentures were offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and were not registered under the Act. The debentures were issued under an Indenture dated October 28, 2002, between the Company and BNY Midwest Trust Company, as trustee. The debentures were sold pursuant to a purchase agreement dated October 23, 2002, among the Company, Banc of America Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as Representatives of the several Initial Purchasers. In connection with the sale of the debentures, the Company also granted to the Initial Purchasers for the benefit of the holders of the debentures certain registration rights with respect to the debentures and the common stock of the Company issuable on conversion of the debentures. The registration rights were granted pursuant to a resale registration rights agreement dated October 28, 2002, among the Company, Banc of America Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as Representatives of the several Initial Purchasers. The Purchase Agreement, the form of the debentures, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively. Simultaneously with the offering of the debentures, the Company separately entered into an agreement with Diageo plc ("Diageo") pursuant to which Diageo granted the Company a call option during a three-year period after the date of the offering to purchase from it approximately 26.2 million shares, subject to adjustment, of the Company's common stock held by Diageo, which equals the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the debentures other than the debentures sold in connection with the overallotment. Diageo also granted the Company a second three-year call option to purchase approximately 2.9 million shares of the Company's common stock held by Diageo, which equals the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the debentures sold in connection with the overallotment. In connection with the execution of the call option agreements, the Company and Diageo also entered into an amendment to the Company's Stockholders Agreement. The Call Option Agreement dated as of October 23, 2002, by and between the Company and Diageo Midwest B.V., the Call Option Agreement dated as of October 28, 2002, by and between the Company and Diageo Midwest B.V. and the First Amendment to Stockholders Agreement dated as of October 28, 2002, by and among the Company, Gramet Holdings Corp. and Diageo are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.4, 4.5 and 10.1, respectively.

In addition, the Company has granted to the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $223,330,000 in aggregate principal amount at maturity of its Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures due 2022 (the "Optional Debentures" and, together with the Firm Debentures, the "Debentures"). The Debentures will be redeemable at the Company's option at any time after October 28, 2005, and will be subject to repurchase at the holders' option in 2005, 2007, 2012 and 2017. Banc of America Securities LLC ("BAS") and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("MS") have agreed to act as representatives of the several Initial Purchasers (in such capacity, the "Representatives") in connection with the offering and sale of the Debentures. The Debentures will be convertible into fully paid, non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"). The Debentures will be convertible initially at a conversion rate of 13.0259 shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of the Debentures, on the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth in the Indenture (as defined below). As used herein, "Conversion Shares" means the shares of Common Stock into which the Debentures are convertible or the shares of Common Stock issued upon the redemption or repurchase of the Debentures. Upon conversion, the Company has the option to deliver cash in lieu of the Conversion Shares, on the terms set forth in the Indenture (as defined below). The Debentures will be issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture") to be dated as of the First Closing Date (as defined in Section 2), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Debentures will be offered and sold to the Initial Purchasers without being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") thereunder, in reliance upon an exemption therefrom. Holders of the Debentures (including the Initial Purchasers and their direct and indirect transferees) will be entitled to the benefits of a Resale Registration Rights Agreement, dated the First Closing Date, between the Company and the Initial Purchasers (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company will agree to file with the Commission a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (the "Registration Statement") covering the resale of the Debentures and the Conversion Shares, and to use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective. This Agreement, the Indenture, the Debentures and the Registration Rights Agreement are referred to herein collectively as the "Operative Documents." The Company understands that the Initial Purchasers propose to make an offering of the Debentures on the terms and in the manner set forth herein and in the Offering Memorandum (as defined below) and agrees that the Initial Purchasers may resell, subject to the conditions set forth herein, all or a portion of the Debentures to purchasers (the "Subsequent Purchasers") at any time after the date of this Agreement. The Debentures are to be offered and sold to or through the Initial Purchasers without being registered with the Commission under the Securities Act in reliance upon exemptions therefrom. The terms of the Debentures and the Indenture will require that investors that acquire Debentures expressly agree that Debentures (and any Conversion Shares) may only be resold or otherwise transferred, after the date hereof, if such Debentures (or Conversion Shares) are registered for sale under the Securities Act or if an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available (including the exemption afforded by Rule 144A ("Rule 144A") thereunder).

SECTION 2. PURCHASE, SALE AND DELIVERY OF THE DEBENTURES. (a) The Firm Debentures. The Company agrees to issue and sell to the several Initial Purchasers the Firm Debentures upon the terms herein set forth. On the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, and upon the terms but subject to the conditions herein set forth, the Initial Purchasers agree, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the principal amount at maturity of Firm Debentures set forth opposite their names on Schedule A at a purchase price of 98.5% of the Issue Price thereof. (b) The First Closing Date. Delivery of the Firm Debentures to be purchased by the Initial Purchasers and payment therefor shall be made at the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York (or such other place as may be agreed to by the Company and the Representatives) at 10:00 a.m. New York time, on October 28, 2002, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company (the time and date of such closing are called the "First Closing Date"). (c) The Optional Debentures; the Second Closing Date. In addition, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, and upon the terms but subject to the conditions herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the several Initial Purchasers to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to $223,330,000 aggregate principal amount of Optional Debentures from the Company at the same price as the purchase price to be paid by the Initial Purchasers for the Firm Debentures. The option granted hereunder may be exercised at
7 any time (but not more than once) upon notice by the Representatives to the Company, which notice may be given at any time on or prior to October 29, 2002. Such notice shall set forth (i) the amount (which shall be an integral multiple of $1,000 in aggregate principal amount at maturity) of Optional Debentures as to which the Initial Purchasers are exercising the option, (ii) the names and denominations in which the Optional Debentures are to be registered and (iii) the time, date and place at which such Debentures will be delivered (which time and date may be simultaneous with, but not earlier than, the First Closing Date; and in such case the term "First Closing Date" shall refer to the time and date of delivery of the Firm Debentures and the Optional Debentures). Such time and date of delivery, if subsequent to the First Closing Date, is called the "Second Closing Date" and shall be determined by the Representatives. Such date may be the same as the Closing Date but not earlier than the Closing Date nor later than 10 business days after the date of such notice. If any Optional Debentures are to be purchased, each Initial Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase the principal amount at maturity of Optional Debentures (subject to such adjustments to eliminate fractional amount as the Representatives may determine) that bears the same proportion to the total principal amount at maturity of Optional Debentures to be purchased as the principal amount at maturity of Firm Debentures set forth on Schedule A opposite the name of such Initial Purchaser bears to the total principal amount at maturity of Firm Debentures. The Representatives may cancel the option at any time prior to its expiration by giving written notice of such cancellation to the Company. (d) Payment for the Debentures. Payment for the Debentures shall be made at the First Closing Date (and, if applicable, at the Second Closing Date) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the order of the Company. It is understood that the Representatives have been authorized, for their own account and the accounts of the several Initial Purchasers, to accept delivery of and receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for, the Firm Debentures and any Optional Debentures the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase. BAS or MS, individually and not as a Representative of the Initial Purchasers, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment for any Debentures to be purchased by any Initial Purchaser whose funds shall not have been received by the Representatives by the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, for the account of such Initial Purchaser, but any such payment shall not relieve such Initial Purchaser from any of its obligations under this Agreement. (e) Delivery of the Debentures. The Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Representatives for the accounts of the several Initial Purchasers the Firm Debentures at the First Closing Date, against the irrevocable release of a wire transfer of immediately available funds for the amount of the purchase price therefor. The Company shall also deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Representatives for the accounts of the several Initial Purchasers, the Optional Debentures the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase at the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, against the irrevocable release of a wire transfer of immediately available funds for the amount of the purchase price therefor. The Debentures shall be registered in such names and denominations as the Representatives shall have requested at least two full business days prior to the First Closing Date (or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be) and shall be made available for inspection on the business day preceding the First Closing Date (or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be) at a location in New York City as the Representatives may designate. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified in this Agreement is a further condition to the obligations of the Initial Purchasers.
8 SECTION 3. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY. The Company further covenants and agrees with each Initial Purchaser as follows: (a) Representatives' Review of Proposed Amendments and Supplements. During such period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the date which is the earlier of nine months after the date hereof or the completion of the resale of the Debentures by the Initial Purchasers (as notified by the Initial Purchasers to the Company), prior to amending or supplementing the Offering Memorandum, the Company shall furnish to the Representatives for review a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement, and the Company shall not print or distribute such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representative reasonably objects. (b) Amendments and Supplements to the Offering Memorandum and Other Securities Act Matters. If, at any time prior to the earlier of nine months after the date hereof or the completion of the resale of the Debentures by the Initial Purchasers (as notified by the Initial Purchasers to the Company), any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Offering Memorandum in order that the Offering Memorandum will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if in the opinion of the Representatives or counsel for the Initial Purchasers it is otherwise necessary to amend or supplement the Offering Memorandum to comply with law, the Company shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers and prepare, subject to Section 3(a) hereof, such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission. (c) Copies of Offering Memorandum. The Company agrees to furnish the Representatives, without charge, until the earlier of nine months after the date hereof or the completion of the resale of the Debentures by the Initial Purchasers (as notified by the Initial Purchasers to the Company) as many copies of the Offering Memorandum and any amendments and supplements thereto as the Representatives may request. (d) Blue Sky Compliance. The Company shall cooperate with the Representatives and counsel for the Initial Purchasers, as the Initial Purchasers may reasonably request from time to time, to qualify or register the Debentures for sale under (or obtain exemptions from the application of) the state securities or blue sky laws or Canadian provincial Securities laws or other foreign laws of those jurisdictions designated by the Representatives, shall comply with such laws and shall continue such qualifications, registrations and exemptions in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Debentures. The Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not presently qualified or where it would be subject to taxation as a foreign corporation. The Company will advise the Representatives promptly of the suspension of the qualification or registration of (or any such exemption relating to) the Debentures for offering, sale or trading in any jurisdiction or any initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, and in the event of the issuance of any order suspending such qualification, registration or exemption, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal thereof at the earliest possible moment. (e) Rule 144A Information. For so long as any of the Debentures are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, the Company shall provide to any holder of the Debentures or to any prospective purchaser of the Debentures
9 designated by any holder, upon request of such holder or prospective purchaser, information required to be provided by Rule 144A(d)(4) of the Securities Act if, at the time of such request, the Company is not subject to the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (f) Legends. Each of the Debentures will bear, to the extent applicable, the legend contained in "Notice to Investors" in the Offering Memorandum for the time period and upon the other terms stated therein. (g) No General Solicitation. Except following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, solicit any offer to buy or offer to sell the Debentures by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising (as those terms are used in Regulation D under the Securities Act) or in any manner involving a public offering within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. (h) No Integration. The Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any "security" (as defined in the Securities Act) in a transaction that could be integrated with the sale of the Debentures in a manner that would require the registration under the Securities Act of the Debentures. (i) Rule 144 Tolling. During the period of two years after the last Closing Date, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its "affiliates" (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) to, resell any of the Debentures which constitute "restricted securities" under Rule 144 that have been reacquired by any of them. (j) Use of Proceeds. The Company shall apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Debentures sold by it in the manner described under the caption "Use of Proceeds" in the Offering Memorandum. (k) Transfer Agent. The Company shall engage and maintain, at its expense, a registrar and transfer agent for the Common Stock. (l) Agreement Not to Offer or Sell Additional Securities. During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the 90th day following the date of the Final Offering Memorandum, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives (which consent may be withheld in their sole discretion), directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or establish an open "put equivalent position" within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(h) under the Exchange Act, or otherwise dispose of or transfer, or announce the offering of, or file any registration statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any shares of Common Stock, options or warrants to acquire shares of the Common Stock or securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into shares of Common Stock (other than as contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the Debentures); provided, however, that (i) the Company may issue shares of its Common Stock or options to purchase its Common Stock, or Common Stock upon exercise of options, pursuant to any stock option, stock bonus or other stock plan or arrangement described in the Final Offering Memorandum, and (ii) the Company may issue, or enter into an agreement to issue, shares of its Common Stock or options or warrants to purchase shares of its Common Stock, or Common Stock in connection with its acquisition of an entity, business or the assets of an entity, provided that such entity enters into a substantially similar lock-up agreement with the Initial Purchasers.
10 (m) Investment Limitation. The Company shall not invest or otherwise use the proceeds received by the Company from its sale of the Debentures in such a manner as would require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. (n) No Manipulation of Price. The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action (i) designed to cause or result in, or that has constituted or might reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any securities of the Company (ii) that would violate Regulation M under the Exchange Act. (o) Existing Lock-Up Agreements. The Company will enforce all existing agreements between the Company and any of its security holders that prohibit the sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or hypothecation of any of the Company's securities in connection with the Company's initial public offering. In addition, the Company will direct the transfer agent to place stop transfer restrictions upon any such securities of the Company that are bound by such existing "lock-up" agreements for the duration of the periods contemplated in such agreements. (p) Diageo Lock-Up Agreement. The Company will not waive the lock-up agreement with Diageo plc without the prior written consent of the Representatives. (q) Inclusion of Conversion Shares. The Company will use its best efforts to have the Conversion Shares approved by the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") for inclusion prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. (r) No Conversion Rate Adjustment. Between the date hereof and Second Closing Date, the Company will not do or authorize any act that would result in an adjustment of the conversion rate of the Debentures. (s) No Directed Selling Efforts. None of the Company, its Affiliates or any person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial Purchasers) will engage in any directed selling efforts (as that term is defined in Regulation S) with respect to the Securities, and the Company and its Affiliates and each person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial Purchasers) will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S. SECTION 4. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES. The Company agrees to pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder and in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation (i) all expenses incident to the issuance and delivery of the Debentures (including all printing and engraving costs), (ii) all fees and expenses of the Trustee under the Indenture, (iii) all necessary issue, transfer and other stamp taxes in connection with the issuance and sale of the Debentures to the Initial Purchasers, (iv) all fees and expenses of the Company's counsel, independent public or certified public accountants and other advisors, (v) all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, printing, shipping and distribution of the Offering Memorandum, all amendments and supplements thereto and this Agreement, (vi) all filing fees, attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the Company or the Initial Purchasers in connection with qualifying or registering (or obtaining exemptions from the qualification or registration of) all or any part of the Debentures for offer and sale under the state securities or blue sky laws or the provincial securities laws of Canada, and, if requested by the Representatives, preparing and printing a "Blue Sky Survey" or memorandum, and any supplements thereto, advising the Initial Purchasers of such qualifications,
11 registrations and exemptions, (vii) the expenses of the Company and the Initial Purchasers in connection with the marketing and offering of the Debentures, (viii) the fees and expenses associated with including the Conversion Shares on the New York Stock Exchange, (ix) all expenses and fees in connection with admitting the Debentures for trading in the PORTAL Market and (x) all other cost and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section. Except as provided in this Section 4, Section 7, Section 10 and Section 11 hereof, the Initial Purchasers shall pay their own expenses, including the fees and disbursements of their counsel. SECTION 5. CONDITIONS OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE INITIAL PURCHASERS. The obligations of the several Initial Purchasers to purchase and pay for the Debentures as provided herein on the First Closing Date and, with respect to the Optional Debentures, the Second Closing Date, shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company set forth in Section 1 hereof as of the date hereof and as of the First Closing Date as though then made and, with respect to the Optional Debentures, as of the Second Closing Date as though then made, to the timely performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and to each of the following additional conditions: (a) Accountants' Comfort Letter. On the date hereof, the Representatives shall have received from KPMG LLP, independent public or certified public accountants for the Company, a letter dated the date hereof and a letter dated the First Closing Date, each addressed to the Initial Purchasers, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to Initial Purchasers, delivered according to Statement of Auditing Standards No. 72 (or any successor bulletin), with respect to the audited and unaudited financial statements and certain financial information contained in the Offering Memorandum with respect to the Company and Pillsbury (and the Representatives shall have received an additional conformed copy of such accountants' letter for each of the several Initial Purchasers). (b) No Material Adverse Change or Rating Agency Change. For the period from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the First Closing Date and, with respect to the Optional Debentures, the Second Closing Date: (i) in the sole judgment of the Representatives there shall not have occurred any Material Adverse Change that makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering and delivery of the Debentures as contemplated by the Offering Memorandum; and (ii) there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded any debt securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act. (c) Opinion of Counsel for the Company. On each of the First Closing Date and the Second Closing Date the Representatives shall have received the favorable opinion of Siri S. Marshall, General Counsel of the Company, dated as of such Closing Date, the form of which is attached as Exhibit A (and the Representatives shall have received an additional conformed copy of such counsel's legal opinion for each of the several Initial Purchasers).
12 (d) Opinion of Counsel for the Initial Purchasers. On each of the First Closing Date and the Second Closing Date the Representatives shall have received the favorable opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Initial Purchasers, dated as of such Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Initial Purchasers. (e) Officers' Certificate. On each of the First Closing Date and the Second Closing Date the Representatives shall have received a written certificate executed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or any Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated as of such Closing Date, to the effect set forth in subsection (b)(ii) of this Section 5, and further to the effect that: (i) for the period from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to such Closing Date, there has not occurred any Material Adverse Change; (ii) the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement are true and correct with the same force and effect as though expressly made on and as of such Closing Date; and (iii) the Company has complied with all the agreements hereunder and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to such Closing Date. (f) Registration Rights Agreement. The Company and the Initial Purchasers shall have executed and delivered the Registration Rights Agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the Initial Purchasers), and the Registration Rights Agreement shall be in full force and effect. (g) PORTAL Designation. The Debentures shall have been designated PORTAL-eligible securities in accordance with the rules and regulations of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (h) Additional Documents. On or before each of the First Closing Date and the Second Closing Date, the Representatives and counsel for the Initial Purchasers shall have received such information, documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purposes of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Debentures as contemplated herein, or in order to evidence the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties, or the satisfaction of any of the conditions or agreements, herein contained. If any condition specified in this Section 5 is not satisfied when and as required to be satisfied, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company at any time on or prior to the First Closing Date and, with respect to the Optional Debentures, at any time prior to the Second Closing Date, which termination shall be without liability on the part of any party to any other party, except that Section 4, Section 7 Section 8 and Section 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. SECTION 6. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS OF INITIAL PURCHASERS. Each of the Initial Purchasers represents and warrants that it is a "qualified institutional buyer," as defined in Rule 144A of the Securities Act (a "QIB"). Each Initial Purchaser agrees with the Company that: (a) The Debentures and the Conversion Shares have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act in connection with the initial offering of the Debentures.
13 (b) The Initial Purchasers are purchasing the Debentures pursuant to a private sale exemption from registration under the Securities Act. (c) The Debentures have not been and will not be offered or sold by such Initial Purchaser or its affiliates acting on its behalf except in accordance with Rule 144A. (d) The Initial Purchasers will not offer or sell the Debentures by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) of Regulation D, including (i) any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar medium or broadcast over television or radio, or (ii) any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any general solicitation or general advertising. (e) The Initial Purchasers have not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, any Debentures except to persons whom they reasonably believe to be QIBs. SECTION 7. REIMBURSEMENT OF INITIAL PURCHASERS' EXPENSES. If this Agreement is terminated by the Representatives pursuant to Section 5, Section 10 or Section 11, or if the sale to the Initial Purchasers of the Debentures on the First Closing Date is not consummated because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or to comply with any provision hereof, the Company agrees to reimburse the Representatives and the other Initial Purchasers (or such Initial Purchasers as have terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves), severally, upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses that shall have been reasonably incurred by the Representatives and the Initial Purchasers in connection with the proposed purchase and the offering and sale of the Debentures, including but not limited to fees and disbursements of counsel, printing expenses, travel expenses, postage, facsimile and telephone charges. SECTION 8. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Indemnification of the Initial Purchasers. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, its officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which such Initial Purchaser or such controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact, in each case, necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives expressly for use in the Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto); and provided, further, that with respect to any Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any Initial Purchaser from whom the person asserting any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense purchased Debentures, or any person controlling such Initial Purchaser, if copies of the Final Offering Memorandum were timely delivered to the Initial Purchaser pursuant to Section 2 and a copy of the Final Offering Memorandum (as then amended
14 or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Initial Purchaser to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Debentures to such person, and if the Final Offering Memorandum (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have. (b) Indemnification of the Company, its Directors and Officers. Each Initial Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of such Initial Purchaser), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or arises out of or is based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of such Initial Purchaser expressly for use therein; and to reimburse the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal and other expense reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action. The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each Initial Purchaser may otherwise have. (c) Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof may be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8 or to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume
15 the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel), approved by the indemnifying party (BAS in the case of Section 8(b) and Section 9), representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party. (d) Settlements. The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. SECTION 9. CONTRIBUTION. If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, from the offering of the Debentures pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Debentures pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Debentures pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total discount received by the Initial Purchasers bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Debentures. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers,
16 on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section 8(c) with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 9; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8(c) for purposes of indemnification. The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Debentures purchased by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each officer and employee of an Initial Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. SECTION 10. DEFAULT OF ONE OR MORE OF THE SEVERAL INITIAL PURCHASERS. If, on the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the several Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Debentures that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount at maturity of Debentures which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Debentures to be purchased on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the principal amount at maturity of Firm Debentures set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate principal amount at maturity of Firm Debentures set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, to purchase the Debentures which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Initial Purchasers
17 shall fail or refuse to purchase Debentures and the aggregate principal amount at maturity of Debentures with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount at maturity of Debentures to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Debentures are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party (other than a defaulting Initial Purchaser) to any other party except that the provisions of Section 4, Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the First Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Offering Memorandum or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. As used in this Agreement, the term "Initial Purchaser" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Initial Purchaser under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement. SECTION 11.

The terms of the Security include those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended ("TIA"), and those set forth in this Security. This Security is subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of all such terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Security and the terms of the Indenture, the terms of the Indenture shall control. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated. 1. INTEREST; ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT. General. The Securities shall not bear cash interest except as otherwise set forth herein, and for Contingent Cash Interest as set forth in the Indenture and in Section 3 hereof. If the Principal Amount at Maturity hereof or any portion thereof, or the Purchase Price, Change of Control Purchase Price, or accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages, if any, are not paid when due (whether upon acceleration pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Indenture, upon the date set for payment of the Redemption Price pursuant to Section 5 hereof, upon the date set for payment of the Redemption Price, Purchase Price or Change in Control Purchase Price pursuant to Section 6 hereof, upon the Stated Maturity of the Securities, upon the Interest Payment Dates pursuant to Section 11.03 of the Indenture or upon the Liquidated Damages Payment Dates as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), then in each such case the overdue amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear cash interest at the rate of 2% per annum, compounded semiannually, which interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was originally due to the date payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for. All such interest shall be payable in cash on demand but if not so demanded shall be paid quarterly to the Holders on the last day of each quarter. Original Issue Discount in the period during which a Security remains outstanding shall accrue at 2.00% per annum, on a semiannual bond equivalent basis using a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months, from the Issue Date. 4
2. METHOD OF PAYMENT. Except as provided below, the Company shall pay Contingent Cash Interest on (i) Global Securities, to DTC in immediately available funds, (ii) any Certificated Security having an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $5,000,000 or less, by check mailed to the Holder of such Security and (iii) any Certificated Security having an aggregate principal amount at maturity of more than $5,000,000, by wire transfer in immediately available funds at the election of the Holder of any such Security. At Stated Maturity, the Company will pay Contingent Cash Interest on Certificated Securities at the Company's office or agency in New York City. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make payments in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof, as the case may be, in respect of Redemption Prices, Purchase Prices, Change of Control Purchase Prices and at Stated Maturity to Holders who surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Securities. The Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Company may make such cash payments by check payable in such money. 3. CONTINGENT CASH INTEREST The Company shall pay Contingent Cash Interest under the circumstances and in the amounts described in Article 11 of the Indenture. Such Contingent Cash Interest, if any, shall be payable on April 27 and October 27 (each, an "INTEREST PAYMENT DATE") of each year, in the manner described in Section 11.02 of the Indenture. 4. INDENTURE. The Securities are general unsecured obligations of the Company limited to $2,233,305,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity. The Indenture does not limit other indebtedness of the Company, secured or unsecured. 5. REDEMPTION AT THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY. No sinking fund is provided for the Securities. The Securities are redeemable for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time on, or after October 28, 2005 upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail for a redemption price equal to the Accreted Value of the Securities redeemed plus accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on those Securities up to (but excluding) the Redemption Date (the "REDEMPTION PRICE"). 5
The table below shows Redemption Prices of a Security per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, assuming that no Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages have accrued, on the dates shown below and at Stated Maturity, which prices reflect accrued Original Issue Discount calculated to each such date. The Redemption Price of a Security redeemed between such dates shall include an additional amount reflecting the additional Original Issue Discount accrued since the next preceding date in the table. In addition, the Redemption Prices set forth below would be increased by the amount of any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages. In no event will any Security be redeemable before October 28, 2005. 6. PURCHASE BY THE COMPANY AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to purchase, at the option of the Holder, all or any portion of the Securities held by such Holder on October 28, 2005, October 28, 2007, October 28, 2012 and October 28, 2017 in integral multiples of $1,000 at a Purchase Price equal to the Accreted Value of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on those Securities up 6
to (but excluding) the Purchase Date. To exercise such right, a Holder shall deliver to the Company a Purchase Notice containing the information set forth in the Indenture, at any time from the opening of business on the date that is 20 Business Days prior to such Purchase Date until the close of business on the third Business Day prior to such Purchase Date, and shall deliver the Securities to the Paying Agent as set forth in the Indenture. The Purchase Price may be paid, at the option of the Company, in cash or by the issuance and delivery of shares of Applicable Stock, or in any combination thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture. At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to offer to purchase the Securities held by such Holder within 30 days (which purchase shall occur 30 days after the date of such offer) after the occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company for a Change of Control Purchase Price equal to the Accreted Value of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on those Securities up to (but excluding) the Change of Control Purchase Date. The Change of Control Purchase Price may be paid, at the option of the Company, in cash or by the issuance and delivery of shares of Applicable Stock, or in any combination thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture. Holders have the right to withdraw any Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. If cash (and/or Applicable Stock if permitted under the Indenture) sufficient to pay the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, of all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased as of the Purchase Date or the Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, is deposited with the Paying Agent, on the Business Day following the Purchase Date or the Change of Control Purchase Date, Original Issue Discount, Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and Liquidated Damages, if any, will cease to accrue on such Securities (or portions thereof) immediately after such Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, and the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such other than the right to receive the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price upon surrender of such Security. 7. NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. Notice of redemption pursuant to Section 5 of this Security will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address. If money 7
sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent prior to or on the Redemption Date, immediately on and after such Redemption Date, Original Issue Discount, Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and Liquidated Damages, if any, will cease to accrue on such Securities or portions thereof. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount at maturity. 8. CONVERSION. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of the Indenture (including, without limitation, the conditions to conversion of this Security set forth in Section 10.01 thereof), a Holder is entitled, at such Holder's option, to convert the Holder's Security (or any portion of the principal amount at maturity thereof that is $1,000 or an integral multiple $1,000), into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion. The Company will notify Holders of any event triggering the right to convert the Securities as specified above in accordance with the Indenture. A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, exercising the option of such Holder to require the Company to purchase such Security may be converted only if such Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The initial Conversion Rate is 13.0259 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. The Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages. Upon conversion, no payment shall be made by the Company with respect to Accrued Original Issue Discount and accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages, if any. Instead, such amount shall be deemed paid by the shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of any Security. In addition, no payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends on the Common Stock, except as set forth in the Indenture. To surrender a Security for conversion, a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the Notice of Conversion attached hereto (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required. 8
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Security. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of such Security, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment as provided in the Indenture. If the Company (i) is a party to a consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange or combination, (ii) reclassifies the Common Stock, or (iii) conveys, transfers or leases its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, the right to convert a Security into shares of Common Stock may be changed into a right to convert it into securities, cash or other assets of the Company or such other Person, in each case in accordance with the Indenture. 9. CONVERSION ARRANGEMENT ON CALL FOR REDEMPTION. Any Securities called for redemption, unless surrendered for conversion before the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, may be deemed to be purchased from the Holders of such Securities at an amount not less than the Redemption Price, by one or more investment bankers or other purchasers who may agree with the Company to purchase such Securities from the Holders, to convert them into shares of Common Stock and to make payment for such Securities to the Trustee in trust for such Holders. 10. PAYING AGENT, CONVERSION AGENT AND REGISTRAR. Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar without notice, other than notice to the Trustee; provided that the Company will maintain at least one Paying Agent in the State of New York, City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, which shall initially be an office or agency of the Trustee. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar. 11. DENOMINATIONS; TRANSFER; EXCHANGE. The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 of principal amount at maturity and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not transfer or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or any Securities in respect of which a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Security to be purchased in part, the portion of the Security not to be purchased) or any 9
Securities for a period of 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed. 12. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of this Security for all purposes. 13. UNCLAIMED MONEY OR SECURITIES. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company upon written request any money or securities held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable unclaimed property law.

Section 2.06. Transfer And Exchange. (a) Subject to Section 2.12 hereof, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security, together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Securityholder or such Securityholder's attorney duly authorized in writing, at the office or agency of the Company designated as Registrar or co-registrar pursuant to Section 2.03, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of any authorized denomination or denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount. The Company shall not charge a service charge for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to pay all taxes, assessments or other governmental charges that may be imposed in connection with the transfer or exchange of the Securities from the Securityholder requesting such transfer or exchange. At the option of the Holder, Securities may be exchanged for other Securities of any authorized denomination or denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount at maturity upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged, together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Securityholder or such Securityholder's attorney duly authorized in writing, at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. The Company shall not be required to make, and the Registrar need not register, transfers or exchanges of Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of Securities to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed) or any Securities in respect of which a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn by the Holder thereof in accordance with the terms of this Indenture (except, in the case of Securities to be purchased in part, the portion thereof not to be purchased) or any Securities for a period of 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed.

accordance with Section 2.12 and this Section 2.06(b). Transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole or in part, to the Depositary, to nominees of the Depositary or to a successor of the Depositary or such successor's nominee. (c) Successive registrations and registrations of transfers and exchanges as aforesaid may be made from time to time as desired, and each such registration shall be noted on the register for the Securities. (d) Any Registrar appointed pursuant to Section 2.03 hereof shall provide to the Trustee such information as the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with the delivery by such Registrar of Securities upon transfer or exchange of Securities. (e) No Registrar shall be required to make registrations of transfer or exchange of Securities during any periods designated in the text of the Securities or in this Indenture as periods during which such registration of transfers and exchanges need not be made. (f) If Securities are issued upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of Securities subject to restrictions on transfer and bearing the legends set forth on the forms of Security attached hereto as Exhibits A and B setting forth such restrictions (collectively, the "LEGEND"), or if a request is made to remove the Legend on a Security, the Securities so issued shall bear the Legend, or the Legend shall not be removed, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Company and the Registrar such satisfactory evidence, which shall include an opinion of counsel, as may be reasonably required by the Company and the Registrar and the Trustee (if not the same Person as the Trustee), that neither the Legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure that transfers thereof comply with the provisions of Rule 144A or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or that such Securities are not "restricted" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Upon (i) provision of such satisfactory evidence, or (ii) notification by the Company to the Trustee and Registrar of the sale of such Security pursuant to a registration statement that is effective at the time of such sale, the Trustee, at the written direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver a Security that does not bear the Legend. If the Legend is removed from the face of a Security and the Security is subsequently held by the Company or an Affiliate of the Company, the Legend shall be reinstated. Section 2.07. Replacement Securities. If (a) any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, or (b) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee 13
shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated Security or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of like tenor and principal amount, bearing a certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be purchased by the Company pursuant to Article 3 hereof, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay or purchase such Security, as the case may be. Upon the issuance of any new Securities under this Section 2.07, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section 2.07 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section 2.07 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. Section 2.08. Outstanding Securities; Determinations Of Holders' Action. Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those cancelled by it, those paid pursuant to Section 2.07, those delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate thereof holds the Security; provided, however, that in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount at maturity of Securities have given or concurred in any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver, or other Act hereunder, Securities owned by the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or such other obligor shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, in determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, only Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows to be so owned shall be so disregarded. Subject to the foregoing, only Securities outstanding at the time of such determination shall be considered in any such determination (including, without limitation, determinations pursuant to Articles 6 and 9). 14
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser. If the Paying Agent holds, in accordance with this Indenture, on a Redemption Date, or on the Business Day following a Purchase Date or a Change of Control Purchase Date, or on Stated Maturity, money or securities, if permitted hereunder, sufficient to pay Securities payable on that date, then immediately after such Redemption Date, Purchase Date, Change of Control Purchase Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, such Securities shall cease to be outstanding and Original Issue Discount, Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on such Securities shall cease to accrue; provided, that if such Securities are to be redeemed, notice of such redemption has been duly given pursuant to this Indenture or provision therefor satisfactory to the Trustee has been made. If a Security is converted in accordance with Article 10, then from and after the time of conversion on the date of conversion, such Security shall cease to be outstanding and Original Issue Discount, Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, shall cease to accrue on such Security. Section 2.09. Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. If temporary Securities are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities upon surrender of the temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose pursuant to Section 2.03, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount at maturity of definitive Securities of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities. Section 2.10. Cancellation. All Securities surrendered for payment, purchase by the Company pursuant to Article 3, conversion, redemption or registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities 15
previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or that any Holder has converted pursuant to Article 10. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with the Trustee's customary procedure. Section 2.11. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of the principal amount at maturity of the Security or any portion thereof, including the Issue Price and Accrued Original Issue Discount, or the payment of any Redemption Price, Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price in respect thereof, and Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages thereon, for the purpose of conversion and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Section 2.12. Global Securities. (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, (A) transfers of a Global Security, in whole or in part, shall be made only in accordance with Section 2.06 and Section 2.12(a)(i) below, (B) transfers of a beneficial interest in a Global Security for a Certificated Security shall comply with Section 2.06, Section 2.12(a)(ii) below and Section 2.12(e)(1) below, and (C) transfers of a Certificated Security shall comply with Section 2.06 and Sections 2.12(a)(iii) and 2.12(a)(iv) below. (i) Transfer of Global Security. A Global Security may not be transferred, in whole or in part, to any person other than the Depositary or a nominee or any successor thereof, and no such transfer to any such other person may be registered; provided that this clause 2.12(a)(i) shall not prohibit any transfer of a Security that is issued in exchange for a Global Security but is not itself a Global Security. No transfer of a Security to any person shall be effective under this Indenture or the Securities unless and until such Security has been registered in the name of such person. Nothing in this Section 2.12(a)(i) shall prohibit or render ineffective any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Security effected in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 2.12(a). (ii) Restrictions on Transfer of a Beneficial Interest in a Global Security for a Certificated Security. A beneficial interest in a Global Security may not be exchanged for a Certificated Security except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth below and in Section 2.12(e)(1) 16
below. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a transfer of a beneficial interest in a Global Security in accordance with Applicable Procedures for a Certificated Security in the form satisfactory to the Trustee, together with: (A) so long as the Securities are Restricted Securities, certification in the form set forth in Exhibit C; (B) written instructions to the Trustee to make, or direct the Registrar to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Security to reflect a decrease in the aggregate principal amount of the Securities represented by the Global Security, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depositary account to be credited with such decrease; and (C) if the Company so requests, an opinion of counsel or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to it as to the compliance with the restrictions set forth in the Legend, then the Trustee shall cause, or direct the Registrar to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depositary and the Registrar, the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities represented by the Global Security to be decreased by the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Certificated Security to be issued, shall issue such Certificated Security and shall debit or cause to be debited to the account of the person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Security equal to the principal amount at maturity of the Certificated Security so issued. (iii) Transfer and Exchange of Certificated Securities. When Certificated Securities are presented to the Registrar with a request: (y) to register the transfer of such Certificated Securities; or (z) to exchange such Certificated Securities for an equal principal amount at maturity of Certificated Securities of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if its reasonable requirements for such transaction are met; provided, however, that the Certificated Securities surrendered for transfer or exchange: (1) shall be duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing; and 17
(2) so long as such Securities are Restricted Securities, such Securities are being transferred or exchanged pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C) below, and are accompanied by the following additional information and documents, as applicable: (A) if such Certificated Securities are being delivered to the Registrar by a Holder for registration in the name of such Holder, without transfer, a certification from such Holder to that effect; or (B) if such Certificated Securities are being transferred to the Company, a certification to that effect; or (C) if such Certificated Securities are being transferred pursuant to an exemption from registration, (i) a certification to that effect (in the form set forth in Exhibit C, if applicable) and (ii) if the Company so requests, an opinion of counsel or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to it as to the compliance with the restrictions set forth in the Legend. (iv) Restrictions on Transfer of a Certificated Security for a Beneficial Interest in a Global Security. A Certificated Security may not be exchanged for a beneficial interest in a Global Security except upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth below. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a Certificated Security, duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, together with: (I) so long as the Securities are Restricted Securities, certification, in the form set forth in Exhibit C, that such Certificated Security is being transferred to a QIB in accordance with Rule 144A, or to an institutional accredited investor within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D of the Securities Act; and (II) written instructions directing the Trustee to make, or to direct the Registrar to make, an adjustment on its books and records with respect to such Global Security to reflect an increase in the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities represented by the Global Security, such instructions to contain information regarding the Depositary account to be credited with such increase, then the Trustee shall cancel such Certificated Security and cause, or direct the Registrar to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and procedures existing between the Depositary and the Registrar, the aggregate principal amount at maturity of Securities represented by the Global Security to be increased by the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Certificated Security 18
to be exchanged, and shall credit or cause to be credited to the account of the person specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Global Security equal to the principal amount at maturity of the Certificated Security so cancelled. If no Global Securities are then outstanding, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of the Company in the form of an Officers' Certificate, a new Global Security in the appropriate principal amount at maturity. (b) Subject to the succeeding Section 2.12(c), every Security shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer provided in the Legend including the delivery of an opinion of counsel, if so provided. Whenever any Restricted Security is presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange for a Security registered in a name other than that of the Holder, such Security must be accompanied by a certificate in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit C, dated the date of such surrender and signed by the Holder of such Security, as to compliance with such restrictions on transfer. The Registrar shall not be required to accept for such registration of transfer or exchange any Security not so accompanied by a properly completed certificate. (c) The restrictions imposed by the Legend upon the transferability of any Security shall cease and terminate when such Security has been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or transferred in compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto) or, if earlier, upon the expiration of the holding period applicable to sales thereof under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act (or any successor provision). Any Security as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms or shall have terminated may, upon a surrender of such Security for exchange to the Registrar in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.12 (accompanied, in the event that such restrictions on transfer have terminated by reason of a transfer in compliance with Rule 144 or any successor provision, by an opinion of counsel having substantial experience in practice under the Securities Act and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Company, addressed to the Company and in form acceptable to the Company, to the effect that the transfer of such Security has been made in compliance with Rule 144 or such successor provision), be exchanged for a new Security, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount at maturity, which shall not bear the restrictive Legend. The Company shall inform the Trustee of the effective date of any registration statement registering the Securities under the Securities Act. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the aforementioned opinion of counsel or registration statement. (d) As used in the preceding two paragraphs of this Section 2.12, the term "transfer" encompasses any sale, pledge, transfer, loan, hypothecation, or other disposition of any Security. 19
(e) The provisions of clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities: (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, a Global Security shall not be exchanged in whole or in part for a Security registered in the name of any person other than the Depositary or one or more nominees thereof, provided that a Global Security may be exchanged for Securities registered in the names of any person designated by the Depositary in the event that (i) the Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or such Depositary has ceased to be a "clearing agency" registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days or (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities. Any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (i) above shall be so exchanged in whole and not in part, and any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (ii) above may be exchanged in whole or from time to time in part as directed by the Depositary. Any Security issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be a Global Security; provided that any such Security so issued that is registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or a nominee thereof shall not be a Global Security. (2) Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be issued in definitive, fully registered form, shall have an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to that of such Global Security or portion thereof to be so exchanged, shall be registered in such names and be in such authorized denominations as the Depositary shall designate and shall bear the applicable legends provided for herein. Any Global Security to be exchanged in whole shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee, as Registrar. With regard to any Global Security to be exchanged in part, either such Global Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the Depositary or its nominee with respect to such Global Security, the principal amount at maturity thereof shall be reduced, by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Trustee. Upon any such surrender or adjustment, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Security issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an authorized representative thereof. (3) Subject to the provisions of clause (5) below, the registered Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any person, including 20
Agent Members (as defined below) and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities. (4) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (1) above, the Company will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of Certificated Securities in definitive, fully registered form. (5) Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary (collectively, the "AGENT MEMBERS") nor any other persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global Security, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security. Section 2.13 . CUSIP Numbers. The Company may issue the Securities with one or more "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers. Section 2.14 . Ranking. The indebtedness of the Company arising under or in connection with this Indenture and every outstanding Security issued under this Indenture from time to time constitutes and will constitute a senior unsecured general obligation of the Company, ranking equally with other existing and future senior unsecured Indebtedness of the Company and ranking senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Company that is expressly made subordinate to the Securities by the terms of such Indebtedness. For purposes of this Section 2.14 only, "Indebtedness" means, without duplication, the principal 21
or face amount of (i) all obligations for borrowed money, (ii) all obligations evidenced by debentures, notes or other similar instruments, (iii) all obligations in respect of letters of credit or bankers acceptances or similar instruments (or reimbursement obligations with respect thereto), (iv) all obligations to pay the deferred purchase price of property or services, (v) all obligations as lessee which are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (vi) all Indebtedness of others guaranteed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is legally responsible or liable (whether by agreement to purchase indebtedness of, or to supply funds or to invest in, others). ARTICLE 3 REDEMPTION AND PURCHASES Section 3.01 . Company's Right To Redeem; Notices To Trustee. Prior to October 28, 2005, the Securities will not be redeemable at the Company's option. Beginning on October 28, 2005, the Company, at its option, may redeem the Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities for cash at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at a redemption price (the "REDEMPTION PRICE") equal to the Issue Price of the Securities redeemed plus Accrued Original Issue Discount, accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Securities redeemed to (but excluding) the Redemption Date. If the Company elects to redeem Securities pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the Redemption Date, the principal amount at maturity of Securities to be redeemed and the Redemption Price. The Company shall give the notice to the Trustee provided for in this Section 3.01 by a Company Order, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee). Securities called for redemption may be surrendered for conversion from the date of notice of the redemption until the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date. The table below shows Redemption Prices of a Security per $1,000 Principal Amount at Maturity on the dates shown below and at Stated Maturity, which prices reflect the Issue Price plus Accrued Original Issue Discount calculated to each such date and assumes that no Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages have accrued. In addition to the Redemption Price payable with respect to all Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed as of a Redemption Date, the Holders of such Securities (or portions thereof) shall be entitled to receive, and the Redemption Price shall include, any accrued and 22
unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and any accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, to the Redemption Date. Section 3.02. Selection Of Securities To Be Redeemed. If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, unless the procedures of the Depositary provide otherwise, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed by lot, on a pro rata basis or by another method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate (so long as such method is not prohibited by the rules of any stock exchange on which the Securities are then listed). The Trustee shall make the selection within five Business Days after it receives the notice provided for in Section 3.01 from outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption. The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal amount at maturity of Securities that have denominations larger than $1,000. Securities and portions of Securities that the Trustee selects shall be in principal amounts at maturity of $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of the Securities or portions of the Securities to be redeemed. 23
Securities and portions of Securities that are to be redeemed are convertible by the Holder until the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Redemption Date. If any Security selected for partial redemption is converted in part before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Security so selected, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Securities that have been converted during a selection of Securities to be redeemed may be treated by the Trustee as outstanding for the purpose of such selection. Section 3.03 . Notice Of Redemption. At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a Redemption Date, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed. The notice shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state: (1) the Redemption Date; (2) the Redemption Price; (3) the Conversion Rate; (4) the name and address of the Paying Agent and Conversion Agent; (5) that Securities called for redemption may be converted at any time before the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Redemption Date; (6) that Holders who want to convert their Securities must satisfy the requirements set forth in Section 8 of the Securities; (7) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price; (8) if fewer than all of the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the certificate numbers, if any, and principal amounts at maturity of the particular Securities to be redeemed; (9) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment of such Redemption Price, Original Issue Discount, Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on Securities called for redemption will cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date; and (10) the CUSIP number(s) of the Securities. 24
At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's expense, provided that the Company makes such request at least seven Business Days prior to the date by which such notice of redemption must be given to Holders in accordance with this Section 3.03. Section 3.04. Effect Of Notice Of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is given, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price stated in the notice except for Securities which are converted in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the Redemption Price stated in the notice. Section 3.05. Deposit Of Redemption Price. Prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time), on the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Securities to be redeemed on that date other than Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption which on or prior thereto have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation or have been converted. The Paying Agent shall as promptly as practicable return to the Company any money not required for that purpose because of conversion of Securities pursuant to Article 10. If such money is then held by the Company in trust and is not required for such purpose it shall be discharged from such trust. Section 3.06. Securities Redeemed In Part. Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder a new Security in an authorized denomination equal in principal amount at maturity to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered. Section 3.07. Purchase Of Securities By The Company At Option Of The Holder. General. Securities shall be purchased by the Company pursuant to Section 6 of the Securities at the option of the Holder on October 28, 2005, October 28, 2007, October 28, 2012 and October 28, 2017 (each, a "PURCHASE DATE"), at a purchase price equal to the Accreted Value of the Securities purchased, plus accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, on those Securities, to (but excluding) such Purchase Date (the "PURCHASE PRICE"), subject to the provisions of Section 3.09. Purchases of Securities hereunder shall be made, at the option of the Holder thereof, upon: (1) delivery to the Paying Agent by the Holder of a written notice of purchase (a "PURCHASE NOTICE") during the period beginning at any time from the opening of business on the date that is 20 Business 25
Days prior to the relevant Purchase Date until the close of business on the third Business Day prior to such Purchase Date stating: (A) the certificate number of the Security which the Holder will deliver to be purchased or the appropriate Depositary procedures if Certificated Securities have not been issued for such Security, (B) the portion of the principal amount at maturity of the Security which the Holder will deliver to be purchased, which portion must be in principal amounts at maturity of $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000, (C) that such Security shall be purchased by the Company as of the Purchase Date pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in Section 6 of the Securities and in this Indenture, and (D) in the event the Company elects, pursuant to Section 3.09(c), to pay the Purchase Price, in whole or in part, in shares of Common Stock but such portion of the Purchase Price shall ultimately be paid to such Holder entirely in cash because any of the conditions to payment of the Purchase Price in shares of Common Stock are not satisfied prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the relevant Purchase Date, as set forth in Section 3.09, whether such Holder elects (i) to withdraw such Purchase Notice as to some or all of the Securities to which such Purchase Notice relates (stating the principal amount at maturity and certificate numbers, if any, of the Securities as to which such withdrawal shall relate), or (ii) to receive cash in respect of the entire Purchase Price for all Securities (or portions thereof) to which such Purchase Notice relates; and (2) delivery of such Security to the Paying Agent at any time after delivery of the Purchase Notice (together with all necessary endorsements) at the offices of the Paying Agent, such delivery being a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Purchase Price therefor; provided, however, that such Purchase Price shall be so paid pursuant to this Section 3.07 only if the Security so delivered to the Paying Agent shall conform in all respects to the description thereof in the related Purchase Notice. If a Holder, in such Holder's Purchase Notice and in any written notice of withdrawal delivered by such Holder pursuant to the terms of Section 3.09, fails to indicate such Holder's choice with respect to the election set forth in clause (D) of Section 3.07(1), such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive cash in respect of the entire Purchase Price for all Securities subject to such Purchase Notice in the circumstances set forth in such clause (D). 26
The Company shall purchase from the Holder thereof, pursuant to this Section 3.07, a portion of a Security, if the principal amount at maturity of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to the purchase of all of a Security also apply to the purchase of such portion of such Security. Any purchase by the Company contemplated pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.07 shall be consummated by the delivery of the consideration to be received by the Holder promptly following the later of the Purchase Date and the time of delivery of the Security. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Holder delivering to the Paying Agent the Purchase Notice contemplated by this Section 3.07 shall have the right to withdraw such Purchase Notice at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Purchase Date by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal to the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 3.12. The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Purchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal thereof. Section 3.08. Purchase Of Securities At Option Of The Holder Upon Change Of Control. (a) (1) If a Change of Control occurs (subject to certain exceptions set forth below), the Securities not previously purchased by the Company shall be purchased by the Company, at the option of the Holder thereof, at a purchase price equal to the Accreted Value of the Securities purchased, plus accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, on those Securities (the "CHANGE OF CONTROL PURCHASE PRICE"), as of the date that is 30 days after the date of a notice of Change of Control delivered by the Company (the "CHANGE OF CONTROL PURCHASE DATE"), subject to satisfaction by or on behalf of the Holder of the requirements set forth in Section 3.08(c). A "CHANGE OF CONTROL" will be deemed to have occurred at such time after the Securities are originally issued when any of the following events shall occur: (i) the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchase, merger or other acquisition transactions, of shares of the Capital Stock of the Company entitling that person to exercise 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of the Capital Stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in elections of directors, other than any acquisition by the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of its employee benefit plans (except that any of those persons shall be deemed to have beneficial 27
ownership of all securities it has the right to acquire, whether the right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); or (ii) the first day on which a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Company are not Continuing Directors; or (iii) the Company consolidates or merges with or into any other person, any merger of another person into the Company, or any conveyance, transfer, sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's properties and assets to another person, other than: (A) any transaction: (1) that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of the Company's Capital Stock; and (2) pursuant to which holders of the Company's Capital Stock immediately prior to the transaction have the entitlement to exercise, directly or indirectly 50% or more of the total voting power of all shares of Capital Stock entitled to vote generally in elections of directors of the continuing or surviving Person immediately after giving effect to such issuance; and (B) any merger, share exchange, transfer of assets or similar transaction solely for the purpose of changing the Company's jurisdiction of incorporation and resulting in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock, if at all, solely into shares of common stock, ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares of the surviving Person or a direct or indirect parent of the surviving corporation. A "CONTINUING DIRECTOR" shall mean: (i) An individual who was a member of the Board of Directors of the Company first elected by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors prior to the date hereof or prior to the time that any person becomes after the date hereof the holder of record of in excess of 20% of the Capital Stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors; or (ii) An individual designated (before such individual's initial election as a director) as a Continuing Director by a majority of the then Continuing Directors. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.08(a)(1), the Company shall not be required to purchase the Securities of the Holders upon a Change of Control pursuant to this Section 3.08 if 100% of the consideration in the transaction or transactions (other than cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of dissenters' appraisal rights) constituting a Change of Control consists of shares of common stock, ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares traded or to be traded immediately 28
following a Change of Control on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, and, as a result of the transaction or transactions, the Securities become convertible into that common stock, ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares (and any rights attached thereto). For the purposes of this Section 3.08, (x) whether a person is a "BENEFICIAL OWNER" shall be determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act and (y) the term "person" includes any syndicate or group that would be deemed to be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act. (b) No later than 30 days after the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Company shall mail a written notice of the Change of Control by first class mail to the Trustee and to each Holder (and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law). The notice shall include a form of Change of Control Purchase Notice to be completed by the Holder and shall state: (1) briefly, the events causing a Change of Control and the date of such Change of Control; (2) the date by which the Change of Control Purchase Notice pursuant to this Section 3.08 must be delivered to the Paying Agent in order for a Holder to exercise the repurchase rights; (3) the Change of Control Purchase Date; (4) the Change of Control Purchase Price; (5) whether the Change of Control Purchase Price will be paid in cash or Applicable Stock, or a combination thereof; (6) the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent; (7) the Conversion Rate; (8) that the Securities as to which a Change of Control Purchase Notice has been given may be converted if they are otherwise convertible pursuant to Article 10 hereof only if the Change of Control Purchase Notice has been withdrawn in accordance with the terms of this Indenture; (9) that the Securities must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect payment; (10) that the Change of Control Purchase Price for any Security as to which a Change of Control Purchase Notice has been duly given 29
and not withdrawn will be paid promptly following the later of the Change of Control Purchase Date and the time of surrender of such Security as described in (9); (11) briefly, the procedures the Holder must follow to exercise rights under this Section 3.08; (12) briefly, the conversion rights, if any, on the Securities; (13) the procedures for withdrawing a Change of Control Purchase Notice; (14) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment of such Change of Control Purchase Price, Original Issue Discount, Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on Securities surrendered for purchase by the Company will cease to accrue on and after the Change of Control Purchase Date; and (15) the CUSIP number(s) of the Securities. (c) A Holder may exercise its rights specified in Section 3.08(a) upon delivery of a written notice of purchase (a "CHANGE OF CONTROL PURCHASE NOTICE") to the Paying Agent at any time on or prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Change of Control Purchase Date: (1) the certificate number of the Security which the Holder will deliver to be purchased or the appropriate Depositary procedures if Certificated Securities have not been issued; (2) the portion of the principal amount at maturity of the Security which the Holder will deliver to be purchased, which portion must be $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000; (3) that such Security shall be purchased pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in Section 6 of the Securities and in this Indenture; and (4) in the event the Company elects, pursuant to Section 3.09, to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price, in whole or in part, in shares of Applicable Stock but such portion of the Change of Control Purchase Price shall ultimately be paid to such Holder entirely in cash because any of the conditions to payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price in shares of Applicable Stock is not satisfied prior to the close of business on the third Business Day prior to the relevant Change of Control Purchase Date, as set forth in Section 3.09, whether such Holder elects (i) to withdraw such Change of Control Purchase Notice as to some or all of the 30
Securities to which such Change of Control Purchase Notice relates (stating the principal amount at maturity and certificate numbers, if any, of the Securities as to which such withdrawal shall relate), or (ii) to receive cash in respect of the entire Change of Control Purchase Price for all Securities (or portions thereof) to which such Change of Control Purchase Notice relates. "APPLICABLE STOCK" means (i) the Common Stock and (ii) in the event of a merger, consolidation or other similar transaction involving the Company that is otherwise permitted hereunder in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, the common stock, ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares of such surviving corporation or its direct or indirect parent corporation. The delivery of such Security to the Paying Agent with the Change of Control Purchase Notice (together with all necessary endorsements) at the offices of the Paying Agent shall be a condition to the receipt by the Holder of the Change of Control Purchase Price therefor; provided, however, that such Change of Control Purchase Price shall be so paid pursuant to this Section 3.08 and Section 3.09 only if the Security so delivered to the Paying Agent shall conform in all respects to the description thereof set forth in the related Change of Control Purchase Notice. If a Holder, in such Holder's Change of Control Purchase Notice and in any written notice of withdrawal delivered by such Holder pursuant to the terms of Section 3.12, fails to indicate such Holder's choice with respect to the election set forth in Section 3.08(c)(4), such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive cash in respect of the entire Change of Control Purchase Price for all Securities subject to such Change of Control Purchase Notice in the circumstances set forth in such Section 3.08(c)(4). The Company shall purchase from the Holder thereof, pursuant to this Section 3.08 and Section 3.09, a portion of a Security if the principal amount at maturity of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to the purchase of all of a Security also apply to the purchase of such portion of such Security. Any purchase by the Company contemplated pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.08 and Section 3.09 shall be consummated by the delivery of the consideration to be received by the Holder on the Change of Control Purchase Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Holder delivering to the Paying Agent the Change of Control Purchase Notice contemplated by this Section 3.08(c) shall have the right to withdraw such Change of Control Purchase Notice at any time prior to the close of business on the last Business Day immediately preceding the Change of Control Purchase Date by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal to the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 3.12. 31
The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Change of Control Purchase Notice or written withdrawal thereof. Section 3.09. Company's Right To Elect Manner Of Payment Of Purchase Price And Change Of Control Purchase Price For Payment. (a) The Securities to be purchased on any Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 3.07 and 3.08(a), respectively, may be paid for, in whole or in part, at the election of the Company, in U.S. legal tender ("CASH") or shares of Applicable Stock, or in any combination of cash and shares of Applicable Stock, subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 3.09(c) and (d). The Company shall designate, in the Company Notice delivered pursuant to Section 3.09(d), whether the Company will purchase the Securities for cash or shares of Applicable Stock, or, if a combination thereof, the percentages of the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, of Securities in respect of which it will pay in cash or shares of Applicable Stock; provided that the Company will pay cash for fractional interests in shares of Applicable Stock. For purposes of determining the existence of potential fractional interests, all Securities subject to purchase by the Company held by a Holder shall be considered together (no matter how many separate certificates are to be presented). Each Holder whose Securities are purchased pursuant to Section 3.07 or 3.08, as the case may be, shall receive the same percentage of cash or shares of Applicable Stock in payment of the Purchase Price for such Securities, except (i) as provided in this Section 3.09(a) with regard to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Applicable Stock and (ii) in the event that the Company is unable to purchase the Securities of a Holder or Holders for shares of Applicable Stock because any necessary qualifications or registrations of the shares of Applicable Stock under applicable state securities laws cannot be obtained, the Company may purchase the Securities of such Holder or Holders for cash. The Company may not change its election with respect to the consideration (or components or percentages of components thereof) to be paid once the Company has given its Company Notice to Holders except pursuant to Section 3.09(b) or pursuant to Section 3.09(c) in the event of a failure to satisfy, prior to the close of business on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, any condition to the payment of the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, in whole or in part, in shares of Applicable Stock. At least three Business Days before each Company Notice Date, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee specifying: (i) the manner of payment selected by the Company, (ii) the information required by Section 3.09(d) in the Company Notice, 32
(iii) if the Company elects to pay the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, or a specified percentage thereof, in shares of Applicable Stock, that the conditions to such manner of payment set forth in Section 3.09(c) have been or will be complied with, and (iv) whether the Company desires the Trustee to give the Company Notice required by Section 3.09(d). (b) Purchase with Cash. At the option of the Company, the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, of Securities in respect of which a Purchase Notice pursuant to Section 3.07(1) or Change of Control Purchase Notice pursuant to Section 3.08(c), as the case may be, has been given, or a specified percentage thereof, may be paid by the Company with cash equal to the aggregate Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, of such Securities. The Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, of Securities in respect of which a Purchase Notice pursuant to Section 3.07(1) or Change of Control Purchase Notice pursuant to Section 3.08(c), as the case may be, has been given shall, for all other Purchase Dates or Change of Control Purchase Dates, as the case may be, be paid in cash. The Company Notice, as provided in Section 3.09(d), shall be sent to Holders (and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law) not less than 30 Business Days prior to such Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be (the "COMPANY NOTICE DATE"). (c) Payment by Issuance of Shares of Common Stock. At the option of the Company, the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, of Securities in respect of which a Purchase Notice pursuant to Section 3.07(1) or Change of Control Purchase Notice pursuant to Section 3.08(c), as the case may be, has been given, or a specified percentage thereof, may be paid by the Company by the issuance of a number of shares of Applicable Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the portion of the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, to be paid in shares of Applicable Stock by (ii) 100% of the Market Price determined by the Company in the Company Notice, subject to the next succeeding paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company issue a number of shares of Applicable Stock greater than the Share Settlement Cap and upon issuing a number of shares of Applicable Stock equal to the Share Settlement Cap, the Company shall pay any remaining amount of the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, in cash. The Company will not issue fractional shares of Applicable Stock in payment of the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be. Instead, the Company will pay cash based on the current market price for all fractional shares. It is understood that if a Holder elects to have more than one 33
Security purchased, the number of shares of Applicable Stock shall be based on the aggregate amount of Securities to be purchased. If the Company elects to purchase the Securities by the issuance of shares of Applicable Stock or in any combination of cash and Applicable Stock, the Company Notice, as provided in Section 3.09(d), shall be sent to the Holders (and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law) not later than the Company Notice Date. The Company's right to exercise its election to purchase Securities through the issuance of shares of Applicable Stock shall be conditioned upon: (i) the Company's not having given its Company Notice of an election to pay entirely in cash and its giving of timely Company Notice of an election to purchase all or a specified percentage of the Securities with shares of Applicable Stock as provided herein; (ii) the registration of such shares of Applicable Stock under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, in each case, if required; (iii) the listing of such shares of Applicable Stock on a national securities exchange or the quotation of such shares of Applicable Stock in an inter-dealer quotation system of any registered United States national securities association; (iv) any necessary qualification or registration under applicable state securities laws or the availability of an exemption from such qualification and registration; and (v) the receipt by the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that (A) the terms of the issuance of the shares of Applicable Stock are in conformity with this Indenture and (B) the shares of Applicable Stock to be issued by the Company in payment of the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, in respect of Securities have been duly authorized and, when issued and delivered pursuant to the terms of this Indenture in payment of the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, in respect of the Securities, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, free from preemptive rights, and, in the case of such Officers' Certificate, stating that the conditions above and the condition set forth in the second succeeding sentence have been satisfied and, in the case of such Opinion of Counsel, stating that the conditions in clauses (i) through (iv) above have been satisfied. Such Officers' Certificate shall also set forth the number of shares of Applicable Stock to be issued for each $1,000 principal amount at maturity of 34
Securities and the Closing Price of a share of Applicable Stock on each Trading Day during the period commencing on the first Trading Day of the period during which the Market Price is calculated and ending on the third day prior to the applicable Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be. If the foregoing conditions are not satisfied with respect to a Holder or Holders prior to the close of business on the last day prior to the Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, and the Company has elected to purchase the Securities pursuant to this Section 3.09 through the issuance of shares of Applicable Stock, the Company shall pay the entire Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, of the Securities of such Holder or Holders in cash. The "MARKET PRICE" means the average of the Closing Prices of the shares of Applicable Stock for the five-Trading Day period immediately preceding and including the third day prior to the applicable Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, (if the third Business Day prior to the applicable Purchase Date is a Trading Day, or if not, then on the last Trading Day prior to the third Business Day), appropriately adjusted to take into account the occurrence, during the period commencing on the first of the Trading Days during the 20-Trading Day period and ending on the Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, of any event described in Sections 10.03 or 10.04. Upon determination of the actual number of shares of Applicable Stock to be issued upon redemption or repurchase of Securities, the Company shall be required to disseminate a press release through Dow Jones & Company, Inc. or Bloomberg Business News containing this information or publish the information on the Company's Web site or through such other public medium as the Company may use at that time. (d) Notice of Election. In connection with any purchase of Securities pursuant to Section 6 of the Securities, the Company shall give notice to Holders setting forth information specified in this Section 3.09(d) (the "COMPANY NOTICE"). In the event the Company has elected to pay the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be (or a specified percentage thereof), with shares of Applicable Stock, the Company Notice shall: (1) state that each Holder will receive a number of shares of Applicable Stock with a value equal to 100% of the Market Price determined as of a specified date prior to the Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, equal to such specified percentage of the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, of the Securities held by such Holder (except any cash amount to be paid in lieu of fractional shares); 35
(2) set forth the method of calculating the Market Price of the shares of Applicable Stock; and (3) state that because the Market Price of shares of Applicable Stock will be determined prior to the Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, Holders of the Securities will bear the market risk with respect to the value of the shares of Applicable Stock to be received from the date such Market Price is determined to the Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be. In any case, each Company Notice shall include a form of Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, to be completed by a Holder and shall state: (i) the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, and the Conversion Rate; (ii) the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent; (iii) that Securities as to which a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has been given may be converted if they are otherwise convertible only in accordance with Article 10 hereof and Section 8 of the Securities if the applicable Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has been withdrawn in accordance with the terms of this Indenture; (iv) that Securities must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect payment; (v) that the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, for any security as to which a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has been given and not withdrawn will be paid promptly following the later of the Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, and the time of surrender of such Security as described in (iv); (vi) the procedures the Holder must follow to exercise its put rights under Section 3.07 or 3.08, as the case may be, and a brief description of those rights; (vii) briefly, the conversion rights, if any, with respect to the Securities; (viii) the procedures for withdrawing a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be (including, without limitation, for a 36
conditional withdrawal pursuant to the terms of Section 3.07(1)(D), Section 3.08(c)(4)or Section 3.12); (ix) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment on Securities for which a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has been submitted, Original Issue Discount, Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages, if any, on such Securities will cease to accrue on and after the Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be; and (x) the CUSIP number of the Securities. At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give such Company Notice in the Company's name and at the Company's expense; provided, however, that, in all cases, the text of such Company Notice shall be prepared by the Company. Section 3.10. Covenants of the Company. All shares of Common Stock delivered upon purchase of the Securities shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim. Section 3.11. Taxes. If a Holder of a purchased Security is paid in shares of Applicable Stock, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on such issue of Applicable Stock. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the Applicable Stock to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Paying Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Applicable Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Paying Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares of Applicable Stock are to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any income tax withholding required by law or regulations. Section 3.12. Effect Of Purchase Notice Or Change Of Control Purchase Notice. (a) Upon receipt by the Paying Agent of the Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice specified in Section 3.07(1) or Section 3.08(c), as applicable, the Holder of the Security in respect of which such Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, was given shall (unless such Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, is withdrawn as specified in the following two paragraphs) thereafter be entitled solely to receive the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, with respect to such Security. Such Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price shall be paid to such Holder, subject to receipts of funds and/or securities by the Paying Agent, promptly following the later of (x) the Purchase Date or the Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, with respect to such Security (provided the conditions in Section 3.07(1) or Section 3.08(c), as applicable, have been satisfied) and (y) the time of delivery of such Security to the Paying Agent by the Holder thereof in the manner required by 37

(b) A Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice may be withdrawn by means of a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the office of the Paying Agent in accordance with the Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, specifying: (1) the certificate number, if any, of the Security in respect of which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted, (2) the principal amount at maturity of the Security with respect to which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted, and (3) the principal amount at maturity, if any, of such Security which remains subject to the original Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, and which has been or will be delivered for purchase by the Company. (c) A written notice of withdrawal of a Purchase Notice may be in the form set forth in Section 3.12(b) or may be in the form of (i) a conditional withdrawal contained in a Purchase Notice pursuant to the terms of Section 3.07(1)(D) or (ii) a conditional withdrawal containing the information set forth in Section 3.07(1)(D) and Section 3.12(b) and contained in a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Paying Agent as set forth in Section 3.12(b).

The Paying Agent will promptly return to the respective Holders thereof any Securities (x) with respect to which a Purchase Notice or Change of 38
Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, has been withdrawn in compliance with this Indenture, or (y) held by it during the continuance of an Event of Default (other than a default in the payment of the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities) in which case, upon such return, the Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.

The Company shall file with the Trustee, within 15 days after it files such annual and quarterly reports, information, documents and other reports with the SEC, copies of its annual report and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In the event the Company is at any time no longer subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, it shall continue to provide the Trustee with reports containing substantially the same information as would have been required to be filed with the SEC had the Company continued to have been subject to such reporting requirements. In such event, such reports shall be provided at the times the Company would have been required to provide reports had it continued to have been subject to such reporting requirements. The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of TIA Section 314(a). Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely conclusively on Officers' Certificates). Section 4.03. Compliance Certificate. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company (beginning with the fiscal year ending in May, 2003) an Officers' Certificate, stating whether or not to the knowledge of the signers thereof, the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, as soon as possible and in any event within five days after the Company becomes aware of the occurrence of any Event of Default or an event which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default, an Officers' Certificate setting forth the details of such Event of Default or default and the action which the Company proposes to take with respect thereto. Section 4.04. Further Instruments And Acts. The Company will execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Indenture. Section 4.05. Maintenance Of Office Or Agency. The Company will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, an office or agency of the Trustee, Registrar, Paying Agent and Conversion Agent where Securities 41
may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, purchase, redemption or conversion and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The office of the Trustee located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, N.Y. 10286, shall initially be such office or agency for all of the aforesaid purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and of any change in the location, of any such office or agency (other than a change in the location of the office of the Trustee). If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the address of the Trustee set forth in Section 12.03. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, for such purposes. Section 4.06. Delivery Of Certain Information. At any time when the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, upon the request of a Holder or any beneficial owner of Securities or holder or beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof, or in accordance with Section 3.08(c), the Company will promptly furnish or cause to be furnished Rule 144A Information (as defined below) to such Holder or any beneficial owner of Securities or holder or beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock, or to a prospective purchaser of any such security designated by any such holder, as the case may be, to the extent required to permit compliance by such Holder or holder with Rule 144A under the Securities Act in connection with the resale of any such security. "RULE 144A INFORMATION" shall be such information as is specified pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. Whether a person is a beneficial owner shall be determined by the Company to the Company's reasonable satisfaction. Section 4.07. Liquidated Damages Notice. In the event that the Company is required to pay Liquidated Damages to holders of Securities pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will provide written notice ("LIQUIDATED DAMAGES NOTICE") to the Trustee of its obligation to pay Liquidated Damages no later than fifteen days prior to the proposed payment date for the Liquidated Damages, and the Liquidated Damages Notice shall set forth the amount of Liquidated Damages to be paid by the Company on such payment date. The Trustee shall not at any time be under any duty to any holder of Securities to determine the Liquidated Damages, or with respect to the nature, extent or calculation of the amount of Liquidated Damages when made, or with respect to the method employed in such calculation of the Liquidated Damages. 42
Section 4.08. Calculation Of Original Issue Discount. The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and actual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. ARTICLE 5 SUCCESSOR PERSON Section 5.01. When Company May Merge Or Transfer Assets. The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, unless: (a) either (1) the Company shall be the continuing corporation or (2) the Person (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety (i) shall be a corporation organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia and (ii) shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all of the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture; (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no event that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; and (c) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with this Article 5 and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been satisfied. For purposes of the foregoing, the transfer (by lease, assignment, sale or otherwise) of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries (other than to the Company or another Subsidiary), which, if such assets were owned by the Company, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of 43
the Company, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company. The successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the successor Person to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor had been named as the Company herein; and thereafter, except in the case of a lease and obligations the Company may have under a supplemental indenture, the Company shall be discharged from all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities. Subject to Section 9.06, the Company, the Trustee and the successor Person shall enter into a supplemental indenture to evidence the succession and substitution of such successor Person and such discharge and release of the Company. ARTICLE 6 DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES Section 6.01. Events Of Default. So long as any Securities are outstanding, each of the following shall be an "Event of Default": (1) the Company fails to convert any portion of the principal amount at maturity of any Security following the exercise by the Holder of the right to convert such Security into Common Stock pursuant to and in accordance with Article 10 hereof; (2) the Company defaults in its obligation to repurchase any Security, or any portion thereof, upon the exercise by the Holder of such Holder's right to require the Company to purchase such Securities pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3.07 or 3.08 hereof; (3) the Company defaults in its obligation to redeem any Security, or any portion thereof, called for redemption by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3.01 hereof. (4) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal amount at maturity of any Security when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity or the payment of any portion of the principal amount at maturity of any Security, including the Issue Price and Accrued Original Discount, when the same becomes due and payable; (5) the Company defaults in the payment of any Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages when due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; 44
(6) the Company fails to comply with any of its agreements or covenants in the Securities or this Indenture (other than those referred to in clause (1) through (5) above) and such failure continues for 60 days after receipt by the Company of a Notice of Default; (7) a failure to pay when due at maturity or a default that results in the acceleration of maturity of any indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company or any Designated Subsidiary in an aggregate amount of $50 million or more, unless the acceleration is rescinded, stayed or annulled within 30 days after written notice of default is given to the Company by the Trustee or Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities then outstanding; (8) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (i) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Designated Subsidiary or any group of two or more Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Designated Subsidiary, in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (ii) a decree or order adjudging the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Designated Subsidiary or any group of two or more Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Designated Subsidiary, a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Designated Subsidiary or any group of two or more Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Designated Subsidiary, under any applicable law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or (9) the commencement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Designated Subsidiary or any group of two or more Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Designated Subsidiary, of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Designated Subsidiary or any group of two or more Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Designated Subsidiary, to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Designated Subsidiary or any group of two or more Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Designated Subsidiary, in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding 45
against the Company, or the filing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Designated Subsidiary or any group of two or more Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Designated Subsidiary, of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable law, or the consent by the Company to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or the taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Designated Subsidiary or any group of two or more Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Designated Subsidiary, of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Designated Subsidiary or any group of two or more Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Designated Subsidiary, in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Designated Subsidiary or any group of two or more Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Designated Subsidiary, expressly in furtherance of any such action. A Default under clause (6) above is not an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding notify the Company and the Trustee, of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default (and such Default is not waived) within the time specified in clause (6) above after actual receipt of such notice. Any such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default." "DESIGNATED SUBSIDIARY" shall mean any existing or future, direct or indirect, Subsidiary of the Company whose assets constitute 15% or more of the total assets of the Company on a consolidated basis. The Trustee shall, within 90 days of the occurrence of a Default, give to the Holders of the Securities notice of all uncured Defaults known to it and written notice of any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto; provided, however, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if it, in good faith, determines that the withholding of such notice is in the best interest of such Holders, except in the case of a Default in the payment of the principal amount at maturity of any Security, or any portion thereof, or any Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages, if any, on any of the Securities when due or in the payment of any redemption or purchase obligation of the Company. Section 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default with respect to the Company specified in Section 6.01(8) or 6.01(9)) 46
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the Accreted Value of the Securities, or any portion thereof, and any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, on all the Securities to be immediately due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such accelerated amount shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(8) or 6.01(9) with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the Accreted Value of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, on all the Securities shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding, by notice to the Trustee (and without notice to any other Securityholder) may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of the principal amount at maturity of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, that have become due solely as a result of acceleration and if all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 7.07 have been paid. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto. Section 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of the principal amount at maturity of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if the Trustee does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of the Securities in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative. Section 6.04. Waiver Of Past Defaults. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding, by notice to the Trustee (and without notice to any other Securityholder), may waive an existing Default and its consequences except (1) an Event of Default described in Section 6.01(1) or 6.01(2), (2) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Securityholder affected or (3) a Default which constitutes a failure to convert any Security in 47
accordance with the terms of Article 10. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right. This Section 6.04 shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)1(B) of the TIA and such Section 316(a)1(B) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA. Section 6.05. Control By Majority. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or that the Trustee determines in good faith is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Securityholders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability unless the Trustee is offered indemnity satisfactory to it. This Section 6.05 shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)1(A) of the TIA and such Section 316(a)1(A) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA. Section 6.06. Limitation On Suits. A Securityholder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless: (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period. A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of any other Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over any other Securityholder. Section 6.07. Rights Of Holders To Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of the principal amount at maturity of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, in respect of the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective 48
due dates expressed in the Securities or any Redemption Date, and to convert the Securities in accordance with Article 10, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates or the right to convert, shall not be impaired or affected adversely without the consent of such Holder. Section 6.08. Collection Suit By Trustee. If an Event of Default described in Section 6.01(2), 6.01(3) or 6.01(4) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount owing with respect to the Securities and the amounts provided for in Section 7.07. Section 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs Of Claim. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal amount at maturity of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, in respect of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of any such amount) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise. (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole principal amount at maturity of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel or any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (b) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or 49
the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding. Section 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money in the following order: FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07; SECOND: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for the principal amount at maturity of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, as the case may be, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to such amounts due and payable on the Securities; and THIRD: the balance, if any, to the Company. The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section 6.10. At least 15 days before such record date, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder and the Company a notice that states the record date, the payment date and the amount to be paid. Section 6.11. Undertaking For Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant (other than the Trustee) in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding. This Section 6.11 shall be in lieu of Section 315(e) of the TIA and such Section 315(e) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA. Section 6.12. Waiver Of Stay, Extension Or Usury Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury or other law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal amount at maturity of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, on Securities, as contemplated herein, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, 50
but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. ARTICLE 7 TRUSTEE Section 7.01. Duties Of Trustee. The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the TIA and as set forth herein. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs. (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default: (1) the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture, but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture, but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein. This Section 7.01(b) shall be in lieu of Section 315(a) of the TIA and such Section 315(a) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.

The Trustee (acting in any capacity hereunder) shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Company. (g) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. (h) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. Section 7.02. Rights Of Trustee. Subject to its duties and responsibilities under the TIA.

Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded. Section 7.03. Individual Rights Of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Registrar, Conversion Agent or co-registrar may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11. Section 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer.

Section 7.05. Notice Of Defaults. If a Default occurs and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall give to each Securityholder notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs or, if later, within 15 days after it is known to the Trustee, unless such Default shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except in the case of a Default described in Section 6.01(1) and 6.01(2), the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interest of the Securityholders. The preceding sentence shall be in lieu of the proviso to Section 315(b) of the TIA and such proviso is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of a Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written notice of such Default, which notice specifically references this Indenture and the Securities. Section 7.06. Reports By Trustee To Holders. Within 60 days after each May 15 beginning with the May 15 following the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder a brief report dated as of such May 15 that complies with TIA Section 313(a), if required by such Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Section 313(b). A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders shall be filed with the SEC and each securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities are listed. The Company agrees to notify the Trustee promptly whenever the Securities become listed on any securities exchange and of any delisting thereof. 54
Section 7.07. Compensation And Indemnity. The Company agrees: (a) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited (to the extent permitted by law) by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (b) to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses, advances and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and (c) to indemnify the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee and their agents for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, damage, claim, liability, cost or expense (including attorney's fees and expenses, and taxes (other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee)) incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company or any Holder or any other person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section 7.07, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay the principal amount at maturity of, or the Redemption Price, Purchase Price, Change of Control Purchase Price, Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages, if any, as the case may be, on particular Securities. The Company's payment obligations pursuant to this Section 7.07 shall survive the discharge of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01(5) or 6.01(6), the expenses including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel, are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law. Section 7.08. Replacement Of Trustee. The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company; provided, however, no such resignation shall be effective until a successor Trustee has accepted its appointment pursuant to this Section 7.08. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Company. The Company shall remove the Trustee if: (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10; (2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent; 55
(3) a receiver or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint, by resolution of its Board of Directors, a successor Trustee. A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company satisfactory in form and substance to the retiring Trustee and the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Securityholders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07. If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Company for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. Section 7.09. Successor Trustee By Merger. If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another corporation, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee. Section 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification. The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA Sections 310(a)(1) and 310(b). The Trustee (or its parent holding company) shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the Commission the application referred to in the penultimate paragraph of TIA Section 310(b). Section 7.11. Preferential Collection Of Claims Against Company. The Trustee shall comply with TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein. 56
ARTICLE 8 DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE Section 8.01. Discharge Of Liability On Securities. When (i) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Securities (other than Securities replaced or repaid pursuant to Section 2.07) for cancellation or (ii) all outstanding Securities have become due and payable and the Company deposits with the Trustee cash sufficient to pay all amounts due and owing on all outstanding Securities (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.07), and if in either case the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then this Indenture shall, subject to Section 7.07, cease to be of further effect. The Trustee shall join in the execution of a document prepared by the Company acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company. Section 8.02. Repayment To The Company. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company upon written request any money or securities held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable unclaimed property law. After return to the Company, Holders entitled to the money or securities must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person and the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no further liability to the Securityholders with respect to such money or securities for that period commencing after the return thereof. ARTICLE 9 AMENDMENTS Section 9.01. Without Consent Of Holders. The Company and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities without the consent of any Securityholder to: (a) add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of Securities; (b) surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company; (c) provide for conversion rights of Holders of Securities if any reclassification or change of the Common Stock or any consolidation, merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets occurs; (d) provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to the Holders of Securities in the case of a merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer or lease pursuant to Article 5 hereof; 57
(e) increase the Conversion Rate; provided, however, that such increase in the Conversion Rate shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities (after taking into account tax and other consequences of such increase); (f) comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA; (g) make any changes or modifications necessary in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act as contemplated in the Registration Rights Agreement; provided, however, that such action pursuant to this clause (g) does not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company (as evidenced by a Board Resolution) and the Trustee, adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities in any material respect; (h) add additional dates on which the Holders of Securities may require the Company to repurchase their Securities; (i) cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein or which is otherwise defective; or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Indenture which the Company may deem necessary or desirable and which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Indenture; provided, however, that such action pursuant to this clause (h) does not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company (as evidenced by a Board Resolution) and the Trustee, adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities in any material respect; and (j) add or modify any other provisions herein with respect to matters or questions arising hereunder which the Company and the Trustee may deem necessary or desirable and which will not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities. Section 9.02. With Consent Of Holders. Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, this Indenture or the Securities may be amended, modified or supplemented, and noncompliance in any particular instance with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities may be waived, in each case with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the principal amount at maturity of the Securities at the time outstanding. Without the written consent or the affirmative vote of each Holder of Securities affected thereby, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not: 58
(a) change the maturity of any Security, or the payment date of any installment of Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages payable on any Security; (b) reduce the principal amount at maturity or the Accrued Original Issue Discount of, or the Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages payable on, or the Redemption Price, Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price of, any Security; (c) impair or adversely affect the conversion rights of any Holder of Securities; (d) reduce the rate at which Original Issue Discount accrues on the Securities; (e) change the currency of any amount owed or owing under the Security or any interest thereon from U.S. Dollars; (f) alter or otherwise modify the rate of Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages on any Security, or the manner of calculation thereof, or extend time for payment of any amounts due and payable to the Holders of the Securities, except as set forth in Article 11 hereof; (g) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment or with respect to, or conversion of, any Security; (h) modify the obligation of the Company to maintain an office or agency in The City of New York pursuant to Section 4.05; (i) adversely affect the purchase right of the Holders of the Securities as provided in Article 3 or the right of the Holders of the Securities to convert any Security as provided in Article 10, except as otherwise permitted pursuant to Article 5 or Section 10.04 hereof; (j) modify the provisions of Article 3 in a manner adverse to the Holders of the Securities; (k) modify any of the provisions of this Section, or reduce the principal amount at maturity of outstanding Securities required to waive a percentage of the aggregate Default, except to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Security affected thereby; or (l) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the outstanding Securities the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture entered into in accordance 59
with this Section 9.02 or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver provided for in this Indenture. It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to each Holder a notice briefly describing the amendment. Nothing in this Section 9.02 shall impair the ability of the Company and the Trustee to amend this Indenture or the Securities without the consent of any Securityholder to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to the Holders of Securities in the case of a merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer or lease pursuant to Article 5 hereof. Section 9.03. Compliance With Trust Indenture Act. Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall comply with the TIA. Section 9.04. Revocation And Effect Of Consents, Waivers And Actions. Until an amendment, waiver or other action by Holders becomes effective, a consent thereto by a Holder of a Security hereunder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same obligation as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent, waiver or action is not made on the Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent, waiver or action as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, waiver or action becomes effective. After an amendment, waiver or action becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder. Section 9.05. Notation On Or Exchange Of Securities. Securities authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for outstanding Securities. Section 9.06. Trustee To Sign Supplemental Indentures. The Trustee shall sign any supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment contained therein does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, but need not, sign such supplemental indenture. In signing such supplemental indenture the Trustee shall receive, and (subject to the provisions of Section 7.01) shall be fully 60
protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. Section 9.07. Effect Of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby. ARTICLE 10 CONVERSIONS Section 10.01. Conversion Privilege. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article 10, a Holder of a Security shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is $1,000 principal amount at maturity or an integral multiple thereof) of such Security into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date of conversion: (1) during any fiscal quarter of the Company (a "FISCAL QUARTER") commencing after November 24, 2002, if as of the last day of the immediately preceding Fiscal Quarter, the Closing Price of the Common Stock for at least 20 Trading Days in the 30 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the last day of such preceding Fiscal Quarter was more than the Specified Percentage multiplied by the Accreted Conversion Price in effect on such 30th Trading Day; (2) at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day preceding the date fixed for redemption, if such Security has been called for redemption pursuant to Article 3 hereof; (3) during any period in which (A) the credit rating assigned to the Securities by both Moody's Investor Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services is Ba3 or lower and BB- or lower, respectively, (B) the credit rating assigned to the Securities by both such rating agencies is suspended or withdrawn or (C) neither of such rating agencies is then rating the Securities; or only one rating agency is rating the Securities and the rating is below the level specified above; (4) at any time following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default; or (5) as provided in Section (b) of this Section 10.01. The Company or a designated agent shall determine on a daily basis whether the Securities shall be convertible as a result of the occurrence of an 61
event specified in clause (1) above and, if the Securities shall be so convertible, the Company shall promptly deliver to the Trustee and Conversion Agent written notice thereof. Whenever the Securities shall become convertible pursuant to Section 10.01, the Company or, at the Company's request, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall promptly notify the Holders of the event triggering such convertibility in the manner provided in Section 12.02, and the Company shall also promptly publicly announce such information and publish it on the Company's Web site. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. (b) In addition, in the event that: (1) the Company makes a distribution described in Section 10.03(d) or (e), where, in the case of a distribution described in Section 10.03(e), the Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of such distribution per share of Common Stock exceeds 15% of the Closing Price of a share of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of declaration of such distribution, then, in each case, the Securities may be surrendered for conversion at any time on and after the date that the Company gives notice to the Holders of such right, which shall be not less than 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Time for such distribution, until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Time or the date the Company announces that such distribution will not take place. (2) the Company consolidates with or merges into another Person, or transfers, sells, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its assets, or is a party to a binding share exchange pursuant to which the shares of Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property as set forth in Section 10.04 hereof, then the Securities may be surrendered for conversion at any time from and after the date which is 15 days prior to the date announced by the Company as the anticipated effective time of such transaction until 15 days after the actual date of such transaction. "SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE" means a percentage equal to 125% for the Measurement Period ending April 27, 2003 and declining 0.25% per Measurement Period thereafter to 115% on October 28, 2022. "EX-DIVIDEND TIME" means, with respect to any issuance or distribution on shares of Common Stock, the first date on which the shares of Common Stock trade regular way on the principal securities market on which the shares of 62
Common Stock are then traded without the right to receive such issuance or distribution. Section 10.02. Conversion Procedure; Conversion Price; Fractional Shares. (a) Each Security shall be convertible at the office of the Conversion Agent into fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) of Common Stock, subject to the right of the Company to deliver cash in lieu of such Common Stock pursuant to Section 10.06. The rate at which shares of Common Stock shall be delivered upon conversion (the "CONVERSION RATE") shall be initially 13.0259 shares of Common Stock for each $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Securities. The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in certain instances as provided in Section 10.03 hereof, but shall not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages. Upon conversion, no payment shall be made by the Company with respect to Accrued Original Issue Discount or any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest. Instead, such amount shall be deemed paid by the shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of any Security. In addition, no payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends on the Common Stock on a converted Security. The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock in connection with any conversion of Securities, but instead shall, subject to Section 10.03(i) hereof, make a cash payment (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to such fraction multiplied by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the last Trading Day prior to the date of conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice exercising such Holder's option to require the Company to repurchase such Security may be converted only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the Section 3.12 hereof. (b) Before any Holder of a Security shall be entitled to convert the same into Common Stock, such Holder shall, in the case of Securities issued in global form, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time, and in the case of Certificated Securities, surrender such Securities, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank, at the office of the Conversion Agent, and shall give written notice to the Company (a "NOTICE OF CONVERSION") at said office or place that such Holder elects to convert the same and shall state in writing therein the principal amount at maturity of Securities to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for Common Stock to be issued. Before any such conversion, a Holder also shall pay all taxes or duties, if any, as provided in Section 10.05. If more than one Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be 63
deliverable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered. Subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Company will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at said office or place to such Holder of a Security, or to such Holder's nominee or nominees, certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together, subject to the last sentence of Section 10.02(a) above, with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled. The Company shall not be required to deliver certificates for shares of Common Stock while the stock transfer books for such stock or the security register are duly closed for any purpose, but certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issued and delivered as soon as practicable after the opening of such books or security register. (c) A Security surrendered for conversion shall be deemed to have been converted as of the close of business on the later of (i) date of the surrender of such Securities for conversion as provided above, (ii) the expiration of the Cash Settlement Notice Period or (iii) if the Company elects to pay cash in lieu of Common Stock pursuant to Section 10.06, the expiration of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period, and the person or persons entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record Holder or Holders of such Common Stock as of the close of business on such date. (d) In case any Security shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the Holder of the Security so surrendered, without charge to such Holder (subject to the provisions of Section 10.05 hereof), a new Security or Securities in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Securities. (e) By delivering to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares as provided in Section 10.02(b) hereof, the Company will satisfy its obligation with respect to the Security, and upon such delivery Accrued Original Issue Discount and accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, with respect to such Security will be deemed to be paid in full rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited. (f) If a Securityholder delivers a Notice of Conversion after the Interest Record Date for a payment of Contingent Cash Interest but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, such Securityholder must pay to the Company, at the time such Securityholder surrenders Securities for Conversion, an amount equal to the Contingent Cash Interest that has accrued and will be paid on the related Interest Payment Date. This Section 10.02(f) shall not apply to a Securityholder that converts Securities that are called by the Company for 64
redemption pursuant to Section 3.01 after an Interest Record Date for a payment of Contingent Cash Interest but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall refund any amount paid by a Securityholder pursuant to this section 10.02(f) if the Cash Settlement Notice period or, if the Company elects to pay cash in lieu of Common Stock pursuant to Section 10.06, the Cash Settlement Averaging Period, ends on or subsequent to the Interest Payment Date immediately following the date such Securityholder delivered a Notice of Conversion. Such refunded amount shall be paid at the time of delivery of the Common Stock and cash deliverable to such Securityholder pursuant to Section 10.02(b) following conversion of any Securities. SECTION 10.03. Adjustment of Conversion Rate. The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows: (a) In case the Company shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination; and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purpose of this paragraph (a), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 10.03(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (b) In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within forty-five (45) days after the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price (as defined below) on the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect immediately 65
prior to the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants plus the number of shares that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such Current Market Price, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase. Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Current Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. (c) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. 66
(d) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants referred to in Section 10.03(b) and excluding any dividend or distribution (x) paid exclusively in cash or (y) referred to in Section 10.03(a) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in this Section 10.03(d) called the "DISTRIBUTED ASSETS"), then, in each such case (unless the Company elects to reserve such Distributed Assets for distribution to the Holders upon the conversion of the Securities so that any such holder converting Securities will receive upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled, the amount and kind of such Distributed Assets which such holder would have received if such holder had converted its Securities into Common Stock immediately prior to the Record Date (as defined in Section 10.03(h)(4) for such distribution of the Distributed Assets)), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall be equal to the rate determined by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such Record Date less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) on the Record Date of the portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock; and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date; provided, however, that in the event the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of Distributed Assets such holder would have received had such holder converted each Security on the Record Date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 10.03(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price of the Common Stock. Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the 67
Company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("TRIGGER EVENT"): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 10.03 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 10.03 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 10.03(d). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 10.03 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued. No adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall be made pursuant to this Section 10.03(d) in respect of rights or warrants distributed or deemed distributed on any Trigger Event to the extent that such rights or warrants are actually distributed, or reserved by the Company for distribution to holders of Securities upon conversion by such holders of Securities to Common Stock. For purposes of this Section 10.03(d) and Sections 10.03(a) and (b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 10.03(d) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 10.03(d) with respect to 68
such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Sections 10.03(a) and (b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution", "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Sections 10.03(a) and (b), and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 10.03(a). (e) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (an "EXTRAORDINARY CASH DIVIDEND") (excluding (x) any quarterly cash dividend on the Common Stock to the extent the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock in any fiscal quarter does not exceed the greater of (A) the amount per share of Common Stock of the next preceding quarterly cash dividend on the Common Stock to the extent that such preceding quarterly dividend did not require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 10.03(e) (as adjusted to reflect subdivisions, or combinations of the Common Stock), and (B) 3.75% of the arithmetic average of the Closing Price (determined as set forth in Section 10.03(h)) during the ten Trading Days (as defined in Section 10.03(h)) immediately prior to the date of declaration of such dividend, and (y) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary), then, in such case, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such record date by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date less the amount of cash so distributed (and not excluded as provided above) applicable to one share of Common Stock, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price of the Common Stock, such adjustment to be effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the record date; provided, however, that in the event the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder converted each Security on the 69
record date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If any adjustment is required to be made as set forth in this Section 10.03(e) as a result of a distribution that is a quarterly dividend, such adjustment shall be based upon the amount by which such distribution exceeds the amount of the quarterly cash dividend permitted to be excluded pursuant hereto. If an adjustment is required to be made as set forth in this Section 10.03(e) above as a result of a distribution that is not a quarterly dividend, such adjustment shall be based upon the full amount of the distribution. (f) In case a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of consideration per share of Common Stock having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) that as of the last time (the "EXPIRATION TIME") tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) exceeds the last reported Closing Price of the Common Stock (determined as provided in the definition of Current Market Price) on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Expiration Time by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "PURCHASED SHARES") and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time and the last reported Closing Price of the Common Stock (determined as provided in the definition of Current Market Price) on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) at the Expiration Time multiplied by last reported Closing Price of the Common Stock (determined as provided in the definition of the Current Market Price) on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. In the event that the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but 70
the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. (g) In case of a tender or exchange offer made by a Person other than the Company or any Subsidiary for an amount that increases the offeror's ownership of Common Stock to more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Common Stock outstanding and shall involve the payment by such Person of consideration per share of Common Stock having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) that as of the last time (the "OFFER EXPIRATION TIME") tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it shall have been amended) that exceeds the last reported Closing Price of the Common Stock (determined as provided in the definition of the Current Market Price) on the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Time, and in which, as of the Offer Expiration Time the Board of Directors is not recommending rejection of the offer, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Offer Expiration Time by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Offer Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "ACCEPTED PURCHASED SHARES") and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Accepted Purchased Shares) at the Offer Expiration Time and the last reported Closing Price of the Common Stock (determined as provided in the definition of the Current Market Price) on the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Time, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) at the Offer Expiration Time multiplied by the last reported Closing Price of the Common Stock (determined as provided in the definition of the Current Market Price) on the Trading Day next succeeding the Offer Expiration Time, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Offer Expiration Time. In the event that such Person is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but such Person is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such 71
purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjustment described in this Section 10.03(g) shall not be made if, as of the Offer Expiration Time, the offering documents with respect to such offer disclose a plan or intention to cause the Company to engage in any transaction described in Section 10.04. (h) For purposes of this Section 10.03, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated: (1) "CLOSING PRICE" with respect to any security on any day shall mean the closing sale price, regular way, on such day or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in each case as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange or, if such security is not quoted or listed or admitted to trading on such New York Stock Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange or quotation system on which such security is quoted or listed or admitted to trading or, if not quoted or listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange or quotation system, the average of the closing bid and asked prices of such security on the over-the-counter market on the day in question as reported by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated, or a similar generally accepted reporting service, or if not so available, in such manner as furnished by any New York Stock Exchange member firm selected from time to time by the Board of Directors for that purpose, or a price determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, a duly authorized committee thereof, whose determination shall be conclusive. (2) "CURRENT MARKET PRICE" shall mean the average of the daily Closing Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Days selected by the Company commencing no more than 30 Trading Days before and ending not later than the earlier of such date of determination and the day before the "ex" date with respect to the issuance, distribution, subdivision or combination requiring such computation immediately prior to the date in question. For purpose of this paragraph, the term "ex" date, (1) when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the Common Stock trades, regular way, on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the Closing Price was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution, and (2) when used with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock, means the first date on which the Common Stock trades, regular way, on such exchange or in such market after the time at which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. 72
In the event that another issuance, distribution, subdivision, combination or tender or exchange offer to which Section 10.03 applies occurs during the period applicable for calculating "Current Market Price" pursuant to the definition in the preceding paragraph, "Current Market Price" shall be calculated for such period in a manner determined by the Board of Directors to reflect the impact of such issuance, distribution, subdivision, combination or tender or exchange offer on the Closing Price of the Common Stock during such period. (3) "FAIR MARKET VALUE", or "FAIR MARKET VALUE" shall mean the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction. (4) "RECORD DATE" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise). (i) The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Sections 10.03(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to holders of record of the Securities a notice of the increase at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect. (j) No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in such rate; provided, however, that any adjustments that by reason of this Section 10.03) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Article 10 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one- 73
hundredth of a share, as the case may be, with one half-cent and 0.005 of a share, respectively, being rounded upward. No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest. To the extent the Securities become convertible into cash, assets, property or securities (other than capital stock of the Company), no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash, assets, property or such securities. (k) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any conversion agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Security at his last address appearing on the Security register provided for in Section 2.03 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment. (l) In any case in which this Section 10.03 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date or Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 10.03(a), (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 10.03(b), (4) the Expiration Time for any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 10.03(f), or (5) the Offer Expiration Time for a tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 10.03(g) (each a "DETERMINATION DATE"), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the relevant Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the holder of any Security converted after such Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 10.03(a). For purposes of this Section 10.03(l), the term "ADJUSTMENT EVENT" shall mean: (i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event, 74
(ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made, (iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and (iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) or clause (5) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable. (m) For purposes of this Section 10.03, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. SECTION 10.04. Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale. If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a subdivision or combination to which Section 10.03(c) applies), (ii) any consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange or combination of the Company with another Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company to any other Person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing that each Security shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange combination, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Securities (assuming, for such purposes, a sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock are available to convert all such Securities) immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange combination, sale or conveyance assuming such holder of Common Stock did not exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange combination, sale or conveyance (provided that, if the kind or amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange 75
combination, sale or conveyance is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("NONELECTING SHARE"), then for the purposes of this Section 10.04 the kind and amount of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange combination, sale or conveyance for each nonelecting share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the nonelecting shares). Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 10. The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each holder of Securities, at its address appearing on the Security register provided for in Section 2.03 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, statutory share exchanges combinations, sales and conveyances. If this Section 10.04 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 10.03 shall not apply. SECTION 10.05. Taxes on Shares Issued. The issue of stock certificates on conversions of Securities shall be made without charge to the converting Holder for any tax in respect of the issue thereof. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of stock in any name other than that of the holder of any Securities converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. SECTION 10.06. Payment of Cash in Lieu of Common Stock. (a) In lieu of delivery of shares of Common Stock upon notice of conversion of any Securities (for all or any portion of the Securities), the Company may elect to pay Holders surrendering Securities an amount in cash per $1,000 Principal Amount at Maturity of Securities equal to the average Closing Price of Common Stock during the Cash Settlement Averaging Period multiplied by the Conversion Rate. "CASH SETTLEMENT AVERAGING PERIOD" means the five consecutive Trading Days immediately following (a) the expiration of the Conversion Retraction Period (as defined below), (b) the Conversion Date, in the case of conversion following the Company's notice of redemption specifying that the 76
Company intends to deliver cash upon conversion, in either case multiplied by the Conversion Rate in effect on that date or (c) the Stated Maturity. (b) The Company will inform the Holders no later than two Business Days following the Conversion Date ("CASH SETTLEMENT NOTICE PERIOD") of its election to pay cash in lieu of delivery of the Common Stock otherwise issuable upon conversion, unless the Company has already informed Holders of its election in connection with the Company's redemption of the Securities pursuant to Section 3.01 herein. Holders may retract their conversion notice at any time during the two Business Day period beginning on the day after the final day of the Cash Settlement Notice Period ("CONVERSION RETRACTION PERIOD"); no such retraction can be made (and a conversion notice shall be irrevocable) if the Company does not elect to deliver cash in lieu of Common Stock (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares). If the conversion notice has not been retracted, then settlement (in cash and/or Common Stock) will occur on the day following the final day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period. If an Event of Default (other than a default in a cash payment upon conversion of the Securities), has occurred and is continuing, the Company may not pay cash upon conversion of any Securities or portion of the Security (other than cash for fractional shares). (c) The Company may also elect to satisfy only part of its obligation to deliver Common Stock upon conversion of Securities with cash, in which case it must specify a fixed dollar amount of cash to deliver (the "ELECTED CASH AMOUNT"). If the Company specifies an Elected Cash Amount the Company shall deliver, for each $1,000 Principal Amount at Maturity of Securities converted (i) the Elected Cash Amount specified by the Company, plus (ii) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the greater of (x) zero and (y) the excess, if any, of the number of shares of Common Stock that would have otherwise been deliverable pursuant to Section 10.02(a) over the number of shares of Common stock equal to the sum of, for each day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period, (1) 20% of the Elected Cash Amount divided by (2) the Closing Price of the Common Stock for such day. SECTION 10.07. Reservation of Shares, Shares to Be Fully Paid; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock. (a) The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for the conversion of the Securities from time to time as such Securities are presented for conversion. (b) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment increasing the Conversion Rate to an amount that would cause the Conversion Price to be reduced below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order 77
that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate. (c) (i) The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Securities or in payment of the Purchase Price or the Change of Control Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.09 will upon issue be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof. (ii) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder or for payment of the Purchase Price or the Change of Control Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.09 require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be. (iii) The Company further covenants that, if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on the NYSE or any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Company will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Security or in payment of the Purchase Price or the Change of Control Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.09; provided, however, that, if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Company to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of the Securities into Common Stock or the first payment of the Purchase Price or the Change of Control Purchase Price in Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.09 in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, the Company covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities or in payment of the Purchase Price or the Change of Control Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.09 in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time. SECTION 10.08. Responsibility of Trustee. The Trustee and any other conversion agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any holder of Securities to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other conversion agent 78
shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Security; and the Trustee and any other conversion agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article 10. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 10.04 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Securities after any event referred to in such Section 10.04 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto. Section 10.09. Notice To Holders Prior To Certain Actions. In case: (a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.03; or (b) the Company shall authorize the granting to the holders of all or substantially all of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants; or (c) of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation, merger or statutory share exchange to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company; the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each holder of Securities at his address appearing on the register provided for in Section 2.03 of this Indenture, as promptly as possible but in any event at least ten (10) days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution 79
of rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, or statutory share exchange sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, or statutory share exchange sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, or statutory share exchange sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. SECTION 10.10. Rights Issued in Respect of Common Stock Issued upon Conversion. The Company has entered into a Rights Agreement, dated as of December 31, 1995 (as amended, the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT") with Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota. Under the Rights Agreement, preference share purchase rights (the "RIGHTS") have been, and may in the future be, issued in respect of shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Securities pursuant to this Article 10 shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of Rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as provided by and subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement as in effect at the time of such conversion. If hereafter the Rights separate from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Rights Agreement so that a Securityholder would thereafter not be entitled to receive any Rights in respect of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Security, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted as provided in Section 10.03(d) on the separation date. In lieu of any such adjustment, the Company may amend the Rights Agreement to provide that upon conversion Securityholders will receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the Rights which would have attached to such shares of Common Stock if the Rights had not become separated from the Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of the Rights Agreement. If the Company hereafter adopts any stockholder rights plan similar to the Rights Agreement, a Securityholder shall be entitled to receive upon conversion of its Securities in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion the related rights for the Common Stock, whether or not the rights under the future stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion, but otherwise subject to the generally applicable terms of such plan and no additional adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made for the future stockholder rights plan under Section 10.03(d). 80
Section 10.11. Unconditional Right Of Holders To Convert. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to convert its Security in accordance with this Article 10 and to bring an action for the enforcement of any such right to convert, and such rights shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. ARTICLE 11 CONTINGENT CASH INTEREST Section 11.01. Contingent Cash Interest. (a) The Company shall pay Contingent Cash Interest with respect to the Securities for any Measurement Period commencing on or after October 28, 2005, if the average Trading Price of a Security for the five Trading Days ending on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the beginning of the relevant Measurement Period exceeds 120% of the Accreted Value of such Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company declares a dividend on the Common Stock for which the Record Date falls prior to the first day of a Measurement Period but the payment date falls within such Measurement Period, then the five Trading Day measuring period for determining the Trading Price will be the five Trading Days preceding such dividend Record Date. "TRADING PRICE" of the Securities on any date of determination means the average of the secondary market bid quotations per Security obtained by the Company or the Calculation Agent for $10,000,000 principal amount at maturity of the Securities at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on such date of determination from three independent nationally recognized securities dealers selected by the Company; provided that if at least three such bids cannot reasonably be obtained by the Company or the Calculation Agent, but two such bids are obtained, then the average of the two bids shall be used, and if only one such bid can reasonably be obtained by the Company or the Calculation Agent, this one bid shall be used. If either the Company or the Calculation Agent cannot reasonably obtain at least one bid for $10,000,000 principal amount at maturity of the Securities from a nationally recognized securities dealer or, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, the bid quotations are not indicative of the secondary market value of the Securities, then the Trading Price of the Securities will equal (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Securities multiplied by (b) the Closing Price of the Common Stock on such date of determination. (b) The amount of Contingent Cash Interest payable per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Securities in respect of any Measurement Period will equal the greater of (i) 15% of the product of (x) the sum of the Regular Cash Dividends paid by the Company per share of Common Stock during the applicable Measurement Period multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount at maturity 81
of Securities at the then applicable Conversion Rate or (ii) $1.50; provided that in no event shall the amount of Contingent Cash Interest exceed $2.50 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Securities for any Measurement Period. "REGULAR CASH DIVIDENDS" mean quarterly or other periodic cash dividends that (1) have not been declared extraordinary dividends by Board of Directors and (2) do not constitute Extraordinary Cash Dividends. Section 11.02. Payment of Contingent Cash Interest. (a) Contingent Cash Interest for any Measurement Period shall be paid on April 27 and October 27 (each, an "INTEREST PAYMENT DATE") of each year, to Securityholders of record as of the date 15 days preceding each Interest Payment Date (the "INTEREST RECORD DATE"). (b) The Company will pay Contingent Cash Interest to a person other than the Securityholder of record on the Interest Record Date if the Company elects to redeem, or Securityholders elect to require us to repurchase, the Securities on a date that is after a Interest Record Date but on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date. In that instance, the Company will pay accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest on the Securities being redeemed or repurchased to, but not including, the Redemption Date, Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, to the same person to whom it will pay the Redemption Price, Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, for those Securities. (c) Each payment of Contingent Cash Interest shall be paid (i) if such Security is held in the form of a Global Security, in same-day funds by transfer to an account maintained by the payee located inside the United States, (ii) if such Security is held in the form of a Certificated Security with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $5,000,000 or less, by check, mailed to the address of such Holder as set forth in the Security Register; or (iii) if such Security is held in the form of a Certificated Security with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of more than $5,000,000, upon the request of the Holder of such Certificated Security, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified by such Holder. In the case of a Global Security, Contingent Cash Interest payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Depositary for the purpose of permitting DTC to credit the payment received by it in respect of such Global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof. Section 11.03. Contingent Cash Interest Notification. (a) By the first Business Day of a Measurement Period for which Contingent Cash Interest will be payable, the Company will disseminate a press release through Dow Jones & Company, Inc. or Bloomberg Business News containing this information or publish the information on its Web site or through such other public medium as it may use may use at that time. 82
(b) On any Interest Payment Date on which Contingent Cash Interest is payable pursuant to this Article 11, the Company shall issue a press release through Dow Jones & Company, Inc. or Bloomberg Business News stating the amount of such Contingent Cash Interest and setting forth the manner in which such amount was calculated, or publish the information on its Web site or through such other public medium as it may use may use at that time.

[FORM OF REVERSE OF GLOBAL SECURITY] Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2022 (the "SECURITIES") of General Mills, Inc., a Delaware corporation (including any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, the "COMPANY"), issued under an Indenture, dated as of October 28, 2002 (the "INDENTURE"), between the Company and BNY Midwest Trust Company, as trustee (the "TRUSTEE"). The terms of the Security include those stated in the Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended ("TIA"), and those set forth in this Security. This Security is subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of all such terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Security and the terms of the Indenture, the terms of the Indenture shall control. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated. 1. INTEREST; ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT. General. The Securities shall not bear cash interest except as otherwise set forth herein, and for Contingent Cash Interest as set forth in the Indenture and in Section 3 hereof. If the Principal Amount at Maturity hereof or any portion thereof, or the Purchase Price, Change of Control Purchase Price, or accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages, if any, are not paid when due (whether upon acceleration pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Indenture, upon the date set for payment of the Redemption Price pursuant to Section 5 hereof, upon the date set for payment of the Redemption Price, Purchase Price or Change in Control Purchase Price pursuant to Section 6 hereof, upon the Stated Maturity of the Securities, upon the Interest Payment Dates pursuant to Section 11.03 of the Indenture or upon the Liquidated Damages Payment Dates as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), then in each such case the overdue amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear cash interest at the rate of 2% per annum, compounded semiannually, which interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was originally due to the date payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for. All such interest shall be payable in cash on demand but if not so demanded shall be paid quarterly to the Holders on the last day of each quarter. Original Issue Discount in the period during which a Security remains outstanding shall accrue at 2.00% per annum, on a semiannual bond equivalent basis using a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months, from the Issue Date. A-4
2. METHOD OF PAYMENT. Except as provided below, the Company shall pay Contingent Cash Interest on (i) Global Securities, to DTC in immediately available funds, (ii) any Certificated Security having an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $5,000,000 or less, by check mailed to the Holder of such Security and (iii) any Certificated Security having an aggregate principal amount at maturity of more than $5,000,000, by wire transfer in immediately available funds at the election of the Holder of any such Security. At Stated Maturity, the Company will pay Contingent Cash Interest on Certificated Securities at the Company's office or agency in New York City. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make payments in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof, as the case may be, in respect of Redemption Prices, Purchase Prices, Change of Control Purchase Prices and at Stated Maturity to Holders who surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Securities. The Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Company may make such cash payments by check payable in such money. 3. CONTINGENT CASH INTEREST The Company shall pay Contingent Cash Interest under the circumstances and in the amounts described in Article 11 of the Indenture. Such Contingent Cash Interest, if any, shall be payable on April 27 and October 27 (each, an "INTEREST PAYMENT DATE") of each year, in the manner described in Section 11.02 of the Indenture. 4. INDENTURE. The Securities are general unsecured obligations of the Company limited to $2,009,975,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity (up to $2,233,305,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity if the initial purchaser's option set forth in the Purchase Agreement is exercised in full). The Indenture does not limit other indebtedness of the Company, secured or unsecured. 5. REDEMPTION AT THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY. No sinking fund is provided for the Securities. The Securities are redeemable for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time on, or after October 28, 2005 upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice by mail for a redemption price equal to the Accreted Value of the Securities redeemed plus accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on those Securities up to (but excluding) the Redemption Date (the "REDEMPTION PRICE"). A-5
The table below shows Redemption Prices of a Security per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, assuming that no Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages have accrued, on the dates shown below and at Stated Maturity, which prices reflect accrued Original Issue Discount calculated to each such date. The Redemption Price of a Security redeemed between such dates shall include an additional amount reflecting the additional Original Issue Discount accrued since the next preceding date in the table. In addition, the Redemption Prices set forth below would be increased by the amount of any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages. In no event will any Security be redeemable before October 28, 2005. 6. PURCHASE BY THE COMPANY AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to purchase, at the option of the Holder, all or any portion of the Securities held by such Holder on October 28, 2005, October 28, 2007, October 28, 2012 and October 28, 2017 in integral multiples of $1,000 at a Purchase Price equal to the Accreted Value of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on those Securities up to (but excluding) the Purchase Date. To exercise such right, a Holder shall A-6
deliver to the Company a Purchase Notice containing the information set forth in the Indenture, at any time from the opening of business on the date that is 20 Business Days prior to such Purchase Date until the close of business on the third Business Day prior to such Purchase Date, and shall deliver the Securities to the Paying Agent as set forth in the Indenture. The Purchase Price may be paid, at the option of the Company, in cash or by the issuance and delivery of shares of Applicable Stock, or in any combination thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture. At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to offer to purchase the Securities held by such Holder within 30 days (which purchase shall occur 30 days after the date of such offer) after the occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company for a Change of Control Purchase Price equal to the Accreted Value of those Securities plus accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, on those Securities up to (but excluding) the Change of Control Purchase Date. The Change of Control Purchase Price may be paid, at the option of the Company, in cash or by the issuance and delivery of shares of Applicable Stock, or in any combination thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture. Holders have the right to withdraw any Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. If cash (and/or Applicable Stock if permitted under the Indenture) sufficient to pay the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price, as the case may be, of all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased as of the Purchase Date or the Change of Control Purchase Date, as the case may be, is deposited with the Paying Agent, on the Business Day following the Purchase Date or the Change of Control Purchase Date, Original Issue Discount, Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and Liquidated Damages, if any, will cease to accrue on such Securities (or portions thereof) immediately after such Purchase Date or Change of Control Purchase Date, and the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such other than the right to receive the Purchase Price or Change of Control Purchase Price upon surrender of such Security. 7. NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. Notice of redemption pursuant to Section 5 of this Security will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at the Holder's registered address. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is deposited with the Paying Agent prior to or on the Redemption Date, immediately on and after such Redemption Date, Original Issue Discount, Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and Liquidated A-7
Damages, if any, will cease to accrue on such Securities or portions thereof. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part but only in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount at maturity. 8. CONVERSION. Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of the Indenture (including, without limitation, the conditions to conversion of this Security set forth in Section 10.01 thereof), a Holder is entitled, at such Holder's option, to convert the Holder's Security (or any portion of the principal amount at maturity thereof that is $1,000 or an integral multiple $1,000), into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price in effect at the time of conversion. The Company will notify Holders of any event triggering the right to convert the Securities as specified above in accordance with the Indenture. A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, exercising the option of such Holder to require the Company to purchase such Security may be converted only if such Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice, as the case may be, is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The initial Conversion Rate is 13.0259 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. The Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages. Upon conversion, no payment shall be made by the Company with respect to Accrued Original Issue Discount and accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest or Liquidated Damages, if any. Instead, such amount shall be deemed paid by the shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of any Security. In addition, no payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends on the Common Stock, except as set forth in the Indenture. To surrender a Security for conversion, a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the Notice of Conversion attached hereto (or complete and manually sign a facsimile of such notice) and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Security. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of such Security, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment as provided in the Indenture. A-8
If the Company (i) is a party to a consolidation, merger, statutory share exchange or combination, (ii) reclassifies the Common Stock, or (iii) conveys, transfers or leases its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, the right to convert a Security into shares of Common Stock may be changed into a right to convert it into securities, cash or other assets of the Company or such other Person, in each case in accordance with the Indenture. 9. CONVERSION ARRANGEMENT ON CALL FOR REDEMPTION. Any Securities called for redemption, unless surrendered for conversion before the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, may be deemed to be purchased from the Holders of such Securities at an amount not less than the Redemption Price, by one or more investment bankers or other purchasers who may agree with the Company to purchase such Securities from the Holders, to convert them into shares of Common Stock and to make payment for such Securities to the Trustee in trust for such Holders. 10. PAYING AGENT, CONVERSION AGENT AND REGISTRAR. Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar without notice, other than notice to the Trustee; provided that the Company will maintain at least one Paying Agent in the State of New York, City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, which shall initially be an office or agency of the Trustee. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar. 11. DENOMINATIONS; TRANSFER; EXCHANGE. The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 of principal amount at maturity and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not transfer or exchange any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed) or any Securities in respect of which a Purchase Notice or Change of Control Purchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Security to be purchased in part, the portion of the Security not to be purchased) or any Securities for a period of 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed. 12. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of this Security for all purposes. A-9
13. UNCLAIMED MONEY OR SECURITIES. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company upon written request any money or securities held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable unclaimed property law. After return to the Company, Holders entitled to the money or securities must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person. 14. AMENDMENT; WAIVER. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the outstanding Securities and (ii) certain Defaults may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the outstanding Securities. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Securityholder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities (i) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of Securities, (ii) to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company in the Indenture, (iii) to provide for conversion rights of Holders of Securities if any reclassification or change of the Company's Common Stock or any consolidation, merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets occurs, (iv) to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to the Holders of Securities in the case of a merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer or lease pursuant to Article 5 of the Indenture, (v) to increase the Conversion Rate; provided, however, that such increase in the Conversion Rate shall not adversely affect the interest of the Holders of Securities (after taking into account tax and other consequences of such increase), (vi) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, (vii) to make any changes or modifications necessary in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act as contemplated in the Registration Rights Agreement; provided, however, that such action pursuant to this clause does not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company (as evidenced by a Board Resolution) and the Trustee, adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities in any material respect, (viii) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision in the Indenture which may be inconsistent with any other provision therein or which is otherwise defective, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture which the Company may deem necessary or desirable and which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Indenture; provided, however, that such action pursuant to this clause does not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company (as evidenced by a Board Resolution) and the Trustee, adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities in any material respect, and (ix) to add or modify any other provisions A-10
in the Indenture with respect to matters or questions arising hereunder which the Company and the Trustee may deem necessary or desirable and which will not adversely affect the interests of the Holders of Securities. 15. DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES. If any Event of Default with respect to Securities shall occur and be continuing, the principal amount at maturity of the Securities and any accrued and unpaid Contingent Cash Interest, if any, and accrued and unpaid Liquidated Damages, if any, on all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. 16. TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH THE COMPANY. Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 17. CALCULATIONS IN RESPECT OF SECURITIES.

9 All obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 3 that are outstanding with respect to any Transfer Restricted Security at the time such security ceases to be a Transfer Restricted Security shall survive until such time as all such obligations with respect to such Transfer Restricted Security shall have been satisfied in full. The Liquidated Damages set forth above shall be the exclusive monetary remedy available to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities for each Registration Default. 4. Registration Procedures. (a) In connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall comply with all the provisions of Section 4(b) hereof and shall use its best efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities, and pursuant thereto, shall as expeditiously as possible prepare and file with the Commission a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the registration on any appropriate form under the Securities Act. (b) In connection with the Shelf Registration Statement and any Prospectus required by this Agreement to permit the sale or resale of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Company shall: (i) Subject to any notice by the Company in accordance with this Section 4(b) of the existence of any fact or event of the kind described in Section 4(b)(iii)(D), use its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective during the Effectiveness Period; upon the occurrence of any event that would cause the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain a material misstatement or omission or (B) not to be effective and usable for resale of Transfer Restricted Securities during the Effectiveness Period, the Company shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement, a supplement to the Prospectus or a report filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in the case of clause (A), correcting any such misstatement or omission, and, in the case of either clause (A) or (B), use its best efforts to cause such amendment to be declared effective and the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus to become usable for their intended purposes as soon as practicable thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may suspend the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement by written notice to the Holders for a period not to exceed an aggregate of 45 days in any 90-day period (each such period, a "SUSPENSION PERIOD") if:
10 (x) an event occurs and is continuing as a result of which the Shelf Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein would, in the Company's judgment, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and (y) the Company determines in good faith that the disclosure of such event at such time could be seriously detrimental to the Company and its subsidiaries; provided that, in the event the disclosure relates to a previously undisclosed proposed or pending material business transaction, the disclosure of which the Company determines in good faith would be reasonably likely to impede the Company's ability to consummate such transaction, the Company may extend a Suspension Period from 45 days to 60 days; provided, however, that Suspension Periods shall not exceed an aggregate of 90 days in any 360-day period. The Company shall not be required to specify in the written notice to the Holders the nature of the event giving rise to the Suspension Period. (ii) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the Effectiveness Period; cause the Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, and to comply fully with the applicable provisions of Rules 424 and 430A under the Securities Act in a timely manner; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Debentures covered by the Shelf Registration Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by the sellers thereof set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus. (iii) Advise the selling Holders promptly and, if requested by such selling Holders, to confirm such advice in writing, except as provided in clause (D) below: (A) when the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to the Shelf Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective,
11 (B) of any request by the Commission for amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement or amendments or supplements to the Prospectus or for additional information relating thereto, (C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement under the Securities Act or of the suspension by any state securities commission of the qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes, or (D) of the existence of any fact or the happening of any event, during the Effectiveness Period, that makes any statement of a material fact made in the Shelf Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein untrue, or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading. If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under state securities or Blue Sky laws, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time and will provide to each Holder who is named in the Shelf Registration Statement prompt notice of the withdrawal of any such order. (iv) Make available at reasonable times for inspection by one or more representatives of the selling Holders, designated in writing by a Majority of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement, and any attorney or accountant retained by such selling Holders, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act, and cause the Company's officers, directors, managers and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such representative or representatives of the selling Holders, attorney or accountant in connection therewith; provided, however, that the Company shall have no obligation to deliver information to any selling Holder or
12 representative pursuant to this Section 4(b)(iv) unless such selling Holder or representative shall have executed and delivered a confidentiality agreement in a form acceptable to the Company relating to such information. (v) If requested by any selling Holders, promptly incorporate in the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus, pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment if necessary, such information as such selling Holders may reasonably request to have included therein, including, without limitation, information relating to the "PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION" of the Transfer Restricted Securities. (vi) Furnish to each selling Holder upon their request, without charge, at least one copy of the Shelf Registration Statement, as first filed with the Commission, and of each amendment thereto (and any documents incorporated by reference therein or exhibits thereto (or exhibits incorporated in such exhibits by reference) as such Person may request). (vii) Deliver to each selling Holder, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus (including each preliminary Prospectus) and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons reasonably may request; subject to any notice by the Company in accordance with this Section 4(b) of the existence of any fact or event of the kind described in Section 4(b)(iii)(D), the Company hereby consents to the use of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders in connection with the offering and the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto. (viii) Before any public offering of Transfer Restricted Securities, cooperate with the selling Holders and their counsel in connection with the registration and qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as the selling Holders may reasonably request and do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required (A) to register or qualify as a foreign corporation or a dealer of securities where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject or (B) to subject itself to general or unlimited service of process or to taxation in any such jurisdiction if they are not now so subject.
13 (ix) Cooperate with the selling Holders to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Transfer Restricted Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends (unless required by applicable securities laws); and enable such Transfer Restricted Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Holders may request at least two Business Days before any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities. (x) Use its best efforts to cause the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other U.S. governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof to consummate the disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities. (xi) Subject to Section 4(b)(i) hereof, if any fact or event contemplated by Section 4(b)(iii)(D) hereof shall exist or have occurred, use its best efforts to prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. (xii) Provide CUSIP numbers for all Transfer Restricted Securities not later than the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement and provide the Trustee under the Indenture with certificates for the Securities that are in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company. (xiii) Cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the NASD and in the performance of any due diligence investigation by any underwriter that is required to be retained in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NASD. (xiv) Otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and all reporting requirements under the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act. (xv) Cause the Indenture to be qualified under the TIA not later than the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement required by this Agreement, and, in connection
14 therewith, cooperate with the Trustee and the holders of Securities to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for such Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA; and execute and use its best efforts to cause the Trustee thereunder to execute all documents that may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the Commission to enable such Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner. (xvi) Cause all Common Stock covered by the Shelf Registration Statement to be listed or quoted, as the case may be, on each securities exchange or automated quotation system on which Common Stock is then listed or quoted. (xvii) Provide to each Holder upon written request each document filed with the Commission pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 and Section 15 of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement, unless such document is available through the Commission's EDGAR system. (c) Each Holder agrees by acquisition of a Transfer Restricted Security that, upon receipt of any notice (a "SUSPENSION NOTICE") from the Company of the existence of any fact of the kind described in Section 4(b)(iii)(D) hereof, such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until: (i) such Holder has received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 4(b)(xi) hereof; or (ii) such Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus. If so directed by the Company, each Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Transfer Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of such notice of suspension. (d) Each Holder agrees, by acquisition of the Transfer Restricted Securities, that no Holder shall be entitled to sell any of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement or to receive a Prospectus relating thereto, unless such Holder has furnished the Company with a Notice and Questionnaire as required pursuant to Section 2(e) hereof (including the information required to be included in such
15 Notice and Questionnaire) and the information set forth in the next sentence. Each Notice Holder agrees promptly to furnish to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Notice Holder not misleading and any other information regarding such Notice Holder and the distribution of such Transfer Restricted Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing. Any sale of any Transfer Restricted Securities by any Holder shall constitute a representation and warranty by such Holder that the information relating to such Holder and its plan of distribution is as set forth in the Prospectus delivered by such Holder in connection with such disposition, that such Prospectus does not as of the time of such sale contain any untrue statement of a material fact relating to or provided by such Holder or its plan of distribution and that such Prospectus does not as of the time of such sale omit to state any material fact relating to or provided by such Holder or its plan of distribution necessary to make the statements in such Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 5. Registration Expenses. All expenses incident to the Company's performance of or compliance with this Agreement shall be borne by the Company regardless of whether a Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective, including, without limitation: (i) all registration and filing fees and expenses (including filings made with the NASD); (ii) all fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities and state Blue Sky or securities laws; (iii) all expenses of printing (including printing of Prospectuses and certificates for the Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of the Debentures) and the Company's expenses for messenger and delivery services and telephone; (iv) all fees and disbursements of counsel to the Company; (v) all application and filing fees in connection with listing (or authorizing for quotation) the Common Stock on a national securities exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the requirements hereof; and (vi) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of the Company.
16 The Company shall bear its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of their officers and employees performing legal, accounting or other duties), the expenses of any annual audit and the fees and expenses of any Person, including special experts, retained by the Company. 6. Indemnification And Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities by the Shelf Registration Statement (including each Initial Purchaser), its directors, officers, and employees and each person, if any, who controls any such Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each, an "INDEMNIFIED HOLDER"), against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to resales of the Transfer Restricted Securities), to which such Indemnified Holder may become subject, insofar as any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in (A) the Shelf Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, in any Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (B) any blue sky application or other document or any amendment or supplement thereto prepared or executed by the Company (or based upon written information furnished by or on behalf of the Company expressly for use in such blue sky application or other document or amendment on supplement) filed in any jurisdiction specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the Transfer Restricted Securities under the securities law of any state or other jurisdiction (such application or document being hereinafter called a "BLUE SKY APPLICATION"); or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each Indemnified Holder promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Holder in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder (or its related Indemnified Holder)
17 specifically for use therein. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Holder, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement set forth in this Section shall be in addition to any liabilities which any such Holder may otherwise have. In no event shall any Holder, its directors, officers or any person who controls such Holder be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total amount received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement exceeds (i) the amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the amount of any damages that such Holder, its directors, officers or any person who controls such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 6 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided, further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 6. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 6 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that the Holders shall have the right to employ a single counsel to represent jointly the Holders and their officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Holders against
18 the Company under this Section 6 if the Holders seeking indemnification shall have been advised by legal counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Holders and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons that are different from or additional to those available to the Company, and in that event, the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company. No indemnifying party shall: (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss of liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) The indemnifying party under this Section shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be withheld unreasonably, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 6(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such
19 settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 shall for any reason be unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 6(a) or 6(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) referred to therein, each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof): (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company from the offering and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities on the one hand and a Holder with respect to the sale by such Holder of the Transfer Restricted Securities on the other, or (ii) if the allocation provided by Section (6)(d)(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in Section 6(d)(i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and a Holder on the other with respect to such offering and such sale shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities purchased under the Purchase Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, bear to the total proceeds received by such Holder with respect to its sale of Transfer Restricted Securities on the other. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Holders on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contribution pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (d).
20 The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 6 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 6, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, no Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Transfer Restricted Securities purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 6(d) are several and not joint. (f) The provisions of this Section 6 shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof, and will survive the sale by a Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities. 7. Rule 144A and Rule 144. The Company agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which the Company (i) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to such Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (ii) is subject to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, to make all filings required thereby in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144. 8. No Participation In Underwritten Registrations. No Holder may participate in any Underwritten Registration hereunder. 9. Miscellaneous. (a) Remedies. The Company acknowledges and agrees that any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Section 2 hereof may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely, and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's
21 obligations under Section 2 hereof. The Company further agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. (b) Actions Affecting Transfer Restricted Securities. The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities as a class that would adversely affect the ability of the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities to include such Transfer Restricted Securities in a registration undertaken pursuant to this Agreement. (c) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not, as of the date hereof, entered into, nor shall it, on or after the date hereof, enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. In addition, the Company shall not grant to any of its securityholders (other than the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities in such capacity) the right to include any of its securities in the Shelf Registration Statement provided for in this Agreement other than the Transfer Restricted Securities. (d) Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of a Majority of Holders; provided, however, that with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly adversely affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such Initial Purchaser against which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent is to be effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing (except the foregoing proviso), a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof, with respect to a matter, which relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and does not directly or indirectly adversely affect the rights of other Holders, may be given by the Majority Holders, determined on the basis of Debentures being sold rather than registered under such Shelf Registration Statement. (e) Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand delivery, first class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telex, facsimile transmission, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery: (i) if to a Holder, at the address set forth on the records of the registrar under the Indenture or the transfer agent of the Common Stock, as the case may be; and
22 (ii) if to the Company, initially at its address set forth in the Purchase Agreement, All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when answered back, if telexed; when receipt acknowledged, if transmitted by facsimile; and on the next Business Day, if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery. Any party hereto may change the address for receipt of communications by giving written notice to the others. (f) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties, including without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities. The Company hereby agrees to extend the benefit of this Agreement to any Holder and any such Holder may specifically enforce the provisions of this Agreement as if an original party hereto. (g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. (h) Debentures Held by the Company or Their Affiliates. Whenever the consent or approval of Holders of a specified percentage of Transfer Restricted Securities is required hereunder, Transfer Restricted Securities held by the Company or its Affiliates (other than subsequent Holders if such subsequent Holders are deemed to be Affiliates solely by reason of their holding of such Debentures) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required percentage. (i) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. (j) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York. (k) Severability. If any one or more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired thereby, it being
23 intended that all of the rights and privileges of the parties shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. (l) Entire Agreement. This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein with respect to the registration rights granted by the Company with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

Section 2.3 Exercise Mechanics. (a) Subject to Section 2.2(a) hereof, the Issuer may exercise the First Call Option, in whole or in part (subject to the mandatory exercise requirement during the period beginning September 29, 2005 and ending on October 28, 2005 described below), on any Business Day within the First Effective Period and may exercise the Second Call Option, in whole or in part (subject to the mandatory exercise requirement during the period beginning September 29, 2005 and ending on October 28, 2005 described below), on any Business Day within the Second Effective Period, by giving three Business Days' prior written notice (a "Call Notice") of exercise in the form of Schedule A to this Agreement, which Call Notice shall be irrevocable and in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.1 hereof, provided, however that (i) prior to September 29, 2005, the Issuer may only exercise the Call Options in respect of a current obligation to issue Ordinary Shares pursuant to the conversion of convertible debt securities issued by the Issuer within 30 days of the date of this Agreement and (ii) the exercise of either of the Call Options during the period beginning on September 29, 2005 to October 28, 2005 shall obligate the Issuer to purchase all Option Shares not previously purchased.
