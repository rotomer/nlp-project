The Registration Statement, at the Execution Time, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x).

(d) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (e) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Depositor, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture. (f) Neither the execution and delivery of the Indenture, the issue and sale of the Notes, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions herein 3
contemplated will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or its Material Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the charter or by-laws of the Company or such subsidiaries, (ii) the terms of any material indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company or such subsidiaries is a party or bound or to which its or their property is subject, or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company or such subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or its subsidiaries or any of its or their properties.

The selected financial data set forth under the caption "Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges" in the Prospectus and Registration Statement fairly present, on the basis stated in the Prospectus and the Registration Statement, the information included or incorporated by reference therein. The pro forma financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the Registration Statement include assumptions that provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the transactions and events described therein, the 4
related pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions, and the pro forma adjustments reflect the proper application of those adjustments to the historical financial statement amounts in the pro forma financial statements included in the Prospectus and the Registration Statement.

(p) The Company has not taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes. 5
Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company and delivered to the Placement Agents or counsel for the Placement Agents in connection with the placement of the Notes shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company, as to matters covered thereby, to the Placement Agents. 2. Placement of Notes; Fees (a) On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein specified, each Placement Agent, acting solely as an agent of the Company, will use its reasonable efforts to solicit offers from the Depositor for the purchase of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes from the Company specified opposite its name in Schedule II attached hereto. Each Placement Agent will communicate to the Company, orally, each offer for the purchase of Notes it has solicited from the Depositor on an agency basis. In the event that a Placement Agent orally communicates to the Company that it has received an offer from the Depositor for the purchase of Notes at a price at least equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, then the Company shall accept such offer in whole, provided that the aggregate of all such offers does not exceed $135,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer has been solicited by a Placement Agent on an agency basis and accepted by the Company or fails to satisfy any condition to its issuance and sale of the Notes hereunder, the Company shall (i) hold such Placement Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from, or as a result of, such default or failure and (ii) pay to such Placement Agent the commission to which it would otherwise be entitled absent such default or failure. (b) The Company hereby agrees to pay to each Placement Agent a commission equal to .30% of the principal amount of each Note to be delivered to a purchaser whose offer has been solicited by such Placement Agent on an agency basis and has been accepted, or is required to be accepted in accordance with the terms hereof, by the Company. Such commission shall be payable, at the option of the applicable Placement Agent, either in the form of a discount from the price received from purchasers of Notes sold through such Placement Agent or directly from the Company. Delivery of Notes sold through a Placement Agent as an agent of the Company shall be made by the Company to such Placement Agent for the account of the purchaser thereof only against payment therefor in immediately available funds. In the event that the purchaser of Notes fails to accept delivery of such Notes or fails to make payment in full therefor on the Closing Date, the applicable Placement Agent shall promptly notify the Company and return such Notes to the Company. If such Placement Agent has theretofore paid the Company for such Notes, the Company shall promptly return the related funds to such Placement Agent and shall reimburse such Placement Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of funds for the period such funds were credited to the Company's account. (c) The Company acknowledges that the placement of Notes arranged by the Placement Agents for the Company on an agency basis is being conducted by the Placement Agents in reliance upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein. 6
3. Delivery of Prospectus; No Contest of Enforceability of Securities Laws Rights. (a) The Company hereby authorizes the Placement Agents to deliver a copy of the Prospectus to each initial purchaser of Pass-Through Certificates (the "Certificates") issued under the Trust Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2002 (the "Trust Agreement"), among Core Bond Products LLC, as depositor, Banc of America Securities LLC, as administrative agent, and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Certificates Trustee"). Furthermore, each of the Company and the Placement Agents (i) acknowledges that the Certificates Trustee has assigned to initial purchasers and subsequent holders of the Certificates its rights against the Company and such Placement Agent under U.S. federal and state securities laws with respect to its purchase of the Notes and (ii) agrees not to contest the enforceability of such assignment. (b) The Company has advised you, and you hereby acknowledge, that (i) the Company has not been involved in, among other things, the creation of the Trust or the preparation of the registration statement and prospectus related to the Certificates, (ii) the Company has no contractual or other arrangements with the Trust, (iii) the Company will not be involved in the distribution of the Certificates, (iv) the Company does not have any contractual or other arrangements related to the Trust with you (other than this Agreement), the Depositor, any other issuers whose securities may be deposited with the Trust or any other party, (v) the Company is not a co-issuer of the Certificates and (vi) the Company is not a partner or joint venturer with respect to the Trust with you, the Trust, the Depositor or any other issuers whose securities may be deposited with the Trust. The Company does not have and is not assuming, and nothing herein contained (except as specifically set forth in paragraph (a) of this Section 3 and in Section 11 hereof) shall create any liability or obligation of the Company with respect to the Trust or its structure or actions, the Certificates or their issuance, offering or sale, the registration statement or prospectus relating to the Certificates or the actions or securities of any other issuer that may deposit securities with the Trust. Any references in this Agreement or any certificate or Legal Opinion delivered hereunder to "the transactions herein contemplated," "the transactions contemplated herein," "the transactions contemplated hereby" and like terms shall refer solely to the issue of the Notes under the Indenture and the sale of the Notes to the Depositor through you as Placement Agents pursuant to this Agreement and shall not be deemed to include matters relating to the Trust or its structure or actions, the Certificates or their issuance, offering or sale, the registration statement or prospectus relating to the Certificates or the actions or securities of any other issuer that may deposit securities with the Trust. 4. Agreements. The Company further covenants and agrees with the Placement Agents that: (a) The Company will use its best efforts to cause any amendment to the Registration Statement to become effective. Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object, except for any pricing supplement relating to General Mills CoreNotes or any prospectus supplement relating to 7
the 3.875% Notes. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Registration Statement has become effective pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the Final Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Placement Agents of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Placement Agents (1) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (2) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Notes, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (3) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (4) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (5) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Placement Agents of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. (c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Placement Agents an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act. (d) The Company will furnish to the Placement Agents and counsel for the Placement Agents, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by a Placement Agent may be required by the Act, as many copies of each Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Placement Agents may reasonably request. (e) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Notes for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Placement Agents may 8
designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Notes and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Notes, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (f) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Placement Agents, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Rule 16a of the Exchange Act in respect of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company with a maturity in excess of one year (other than the Notes, the 3.875% Notes, and any General Mills CoreNotes) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Closing Date. (g) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes. 5.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Placement Agents and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and public officials. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date. (c) The Placement Agents shall have received from Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Placement Agents, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Placement Agents, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Notes, the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Placement Agents may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. (d) The Company shall have furnished to the Placement Agents a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or any Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have reviewed the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, any supplements to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) to the knowledge of such officers, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened; and 12
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus, there has been no material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations, prospects, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus. (e) The Company shall have requested and caused KPMG LLP to have furnished to the Placement Agents, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Placement Agents), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Placement Agents, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and that they have performed a review of the unaudited interim financial information of each of the Company and The Pillsbury Company ("Pillsbury") for the period ended on and as at the date of the most recent unaudited financial statements of each the Company and Pillsbury included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards No. 71, and stating in effect, except as provided in Schedule I hereto, that: (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission; (ii) on the basis of a reading of the unaudited financial statements of each of the Company and Pillsbury made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; their limited review, in accordance with standards established under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 71, of the unaudited interim financial information for the period ended on and as at the date of the unaudited financial statements of each of the Company and Pillsbury included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, as indicated in their report which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and committees of the Company and the subsidiaries; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and committees of Pillsbury; and inquiries of certain officials of each of the Company and Pillsbury who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the 13
most recent unaudited financial statements of the Company or Pillsbury, as the case may be, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or in reports on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any capsule information), audited or unaudited, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than three Business Days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or capital stock of the Company or decreases in the stockholders' equity of the Company or in consolidated net current assets as compared with the amounts shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of the date indicated above included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date one day after the date above to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year for sales, earnings before taxes and earnings from joint ventures or in total or per share amounts of net earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Placement Agents; and (3) the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item 302 (Supplementary Financial Information), Item 402 (Executive Compensation) and Item 503(d) (Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K; 14
(iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions "Summary," "Risk Factors" and "Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges" in the Final Prospectus, the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 2, 6, 7 and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated by reference in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or reports on Form 8-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation; and (iv) on the basis of a reading of the unaudited pro forma financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (the "pro forma financial statements"); carrying out certain specified procedures; inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters; and proving the arithmetic accuracy of the application of the pro forma adjustments to the historical amounts in the pro forma financial statements, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that the unaudited pro forma financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X or that the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of such statements. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter. (f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations, prospects, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Placement Agents, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Notes as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus. 15
(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change. (h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Placement Agents such further information, certificates and documents as the Placement Agents may reasonably request. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Placement Agents and counsel for the Placement Agents, this Agreement and all obligations of the Placement Agents hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Placement Agents. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 5 shall be delivered at the office of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Placement Agents, at 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 on the Closing Date. 6. Payment of Expenses. (a) The Company will pay or cause to be paid all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including (i) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits) and each amendment thereto, (ii) the delivery to the Placement Agents of this Agreement and such other documents as may be required in connection with the offering, purchase, sale, issuance or delivery of the Notes, (iii) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel, accountants and other advisors, (iv) the qualification of the Notes under securities laws in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(d) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Placement Agents in connection therewith, (v) the printing and delivery to the Placement Agents of copies of each of the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto, and (vi) the fees and expenses of any transfer agent or registrar for the Notes. (b) If the placement of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Placement Agents set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 8 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof, the Company will reimburse the Placement Agents severally on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed placement of the Notes. 16
7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Placement Agents, the directors of each of the Placement Agents and each person who controls any Placement Agent within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Notes as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Placement Agent specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Placement Agent severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Placement Agent, but only with reference to written information relating to any Placement Agent furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Placement Agent specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Placement Agent may otherwise have. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); 17
provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Placement Agents severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Placement Agents may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Placement Agents on the other from the placement of the Notes; provided, however, that in no case shall any Placement Agent be responsible for any amount in excess of the commission applicable to the placement of the Notes, after taking into account the amount of damages such Placement Agent is otherwise required to pay, if any. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Placement Agents shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Placement Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Placement Agents shall be deemed to be equal to the total placement agent commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Placement Agents on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company 18
and the Placement Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls a Placement Agent within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of a Placement Agent shall have the same rights to contribution as such Placement Agent, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 8. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Placement Agents, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Notes, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) there shall have occurred any material disruption in securities clearance or settlement services, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Placement Agents, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Notes as contemplated by the Final Prospectus. 9. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company and of any Placement Agent set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Placement Agents or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes. The provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 10. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Placement Agents, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to each of Banc of America Securities LLC, Attention: Transaction Services (fax no.: (212) 933-2625) and J.P.

Exhibit 4.1 GENERAL MILLS, INC. OFFICERS' CERTIFICATE AND AUTHENTICATION ORDER Pursuant to the Indenture dated as of February 1, 1996 (the "Indenture") between General Mills, Inc. (the "Company") and U. S. Bank National Association (formerly known as First Trust of Illinois, National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee"), and resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on December 17, 2001 and the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company on December 17, 2001, this Officers' Certificate and Authentication Order is being delivered to the Trustee to establish the terms of a series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 of the Indenture, to establish the form of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, to request the authentication and delivery of the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture and to comply with the provisions of Section 102 of the Indenture. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein and defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture. A. ESTABLISHMENT OF SERIES PURSUANT TO SECTION 301 OF INDENTURE. There is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms (the numbered clauses set forth below correspond to the numbered subsections of Section 301 of the Indenture): (1) The series of Securities being authorized shall bear the title "3.901% Notes due 2007" (the "Notes"). (2) There shall be no limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture pursuant to this Officers' Certificate and Authentication Order shall be limited to the amount set forth in Section C below (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture and except for any Notes which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered under the Indenture). (3) Interest on each Note will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date (as defined in paragraph 5 below), except that interest due at Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom the principal of the Note is paid. (4) The Notes will mature on November 30, 2007, unless the principal of any Note, or any installment of principal, becomes due and payable prior to such date. If the date of Maturity of a Note is not a Business Day, the payment due on such day shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall accrue for the period from Maturity to that next succeeding Business Day. "Business Day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in the Place of Payment (as defined in paragraph 6 below) are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. (5) Each Note will bear interest from and including November 20, 2002 or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) as to which interest on such Note (or any Predecessor Security with respect to such Note) has been paid or made available for payment at an annual rate of 3.901% until the principal of the Note is paid or made available for payment. Each payment of interest on a Note will include interest to, but excluding, as the case may be, the relevant Interest Payment Date or Maturity. The "Interest Payment Dates" for the Notes will be May 30 and November 30 of each year beginning on May 30, 2003 and the Regular Record Dates will be the May 15 or November 15, respectively, next preceding such Interest Payment Date whether or not a Business Day. If any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, the payment due on such day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall accrue for the period from such Interest Payment Date to that next succeeding Business Day. Interest (including interest for partial periods) will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. (6) Payment of principal of and premium (if any) and interest on each Note that is represented by a Global Security will be made to the Depositary (as specified in paragraph 16 below) or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole Holder of the Notes represented thereby for all purposes under the Indenture. Payment of principal of and premium (if any) and interest on each Note that is not represented by a Global Security will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Note at the office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (which shall initially be the office of the Trustee). Registered Holders that wish to receive payment in immediately available funds must provide appropriate written wire transfer instructions sufficiently in advance of the payment date and present the Note in time for the party making the payment to make payments in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures. Any wire transfer instructions received by a party making payments shall remain in effect until revoked by the registered Holder. Payment in accordance with written wire transfer instructions from a registered Holder shall be deemed to constitute full and complete payment of all amounts so paid. The Company may, at its option, elect to make payments of interest other than at Maturity by check mailed to the address of the registered Holder thereof as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date as such address appears in the Security Register. The "Place of Payment" with respect to the Notes shall be the City of New York. 2
(7) The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at its option at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (x) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the redemption date or (y) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate (as defined below), as determined by the reference treasury dealer (as defined below), plus 15 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to but excluding the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Notice of redemption will be given to the registered Holders of the Notes to be redeemed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, which date and the applicable redemption price will be specified in the notice. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the redemption date and at the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest). On or before the redemption date, the Company will deposit with a Paying Agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes or any portion of the Notes to be redeemed on that date. For purposes of the foregoing: (a) "treasury rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the comparable treasury issue, assuming a price for the comparable treasury issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the comparable treasury price for such redemption date; (b) "comparable treasury issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the reference treasury dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes; (c) "comparable treasury price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (i) the average of the reference treasury dealer quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such reference treasury dealer quotations, or (ii) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such reference treasury dealer quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (iii) if only one reference treasury dealer quotation is received, such quotation; (d) "reference treasury dealer" means (i) Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (or their respective associates which are primary treasury dealers), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if either of Banc of America Securities LLC or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. shall cease to be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a "primary treasury dealer"), the Company will substitute another primary treasury dealer; and (ii) any other primary treasury dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company; and (e) "reference treasury dealer quotation" means, with respect to each reference treasury 3
dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the comparable treasury issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the trustee by such reference treasury dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third business day preceding such redemption date. (8) The Company shall have no obligation to redeem or repurchase any Notes either pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of any Holder thereof. (15) The Notes shall be defeasible, in whole or any specified part, pursuant to Section 1302 or Section 1303 of the Indenture or both such Sections. (16) The Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. The Depositary with respect to such Global Securities shall be The Depository Trust Company. The Global Securities shall bear the legends set forth on the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A. Except as provided in the clause (2) of the last paragraph of Section 305 of the Indenture, such Global Security may not be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of such Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name or names of Persons other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof. So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered holder of any Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole Holder of the Notes represented by such Global Security for all purposes under the Notes and the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their 8
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

I have relied as to matters of fact
General Mills, Inc. November 20, 2002 Page 2 (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent I deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the 3.901% Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in the manner specified in the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to the Agency Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms. The opinion set forth above is subject to the following qualifications and exceptions: (a) My opinion is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar law of general application affecting creditors' rights. (b) My opinion is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including (without limitation) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and other similar doctrines affecting the enforceability of agreements generally (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (c) I express no opinion as to the enforceability of (i) provisions that relate to choice of law; (ii) waivers by the Company of any statutory or constitutional rights or remedies; or (iii) terms which excuse any person or entity from liability for, or require the Company to indemnify such person or entity against, such person's or entity's negligence or willful misconduct. (d) I draw your attention to the fact that, under certain circumstances, the enforceability of terms to the effect that provisions may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited. My opinion expressed above is limited to the federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the Delaware General Corporation Law. I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to myself under the caption "Validity of Notes" in the Prospectus Supplement.
