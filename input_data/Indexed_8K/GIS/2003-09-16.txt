EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 16, 2003 CONTACTS: (Media) Marybeth Thorsgaard (763) 764-6364 (Analysts) Kris Wenker (763) 764-2607 GENERAL MILLS REPORTS RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2004 FIRST QUARTER NET EPS GREW 26 PERCENT NET SALES INCREASED 7 PERCENT COMPANY REAFFIRMS FISCAL 2004 EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS MINNEAPOLIS, MINN. - General Mills, Inc. (NYSE: GIS) today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Net sales for the 13 weeks ended Aug. 24th, 2003, grew 7 percent to $2.52 billion. Earnings after tax grew 29 percent to $227 million, and net diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 26 percent from 47 cents in last year's first quarter to 59 cents this year. Net results for both years include certain costs primarily related to the company's acquisition of Pillsbury on October 31, 2001. These costs (described in detail below) are the restructuring and other exit costs identified on the consolidated statements of earnings, and merger-related costs included in selling, -more-
general and administrative expenses. These costs amounted to $15 million pretax, $10 million after tax in fiscal 2004, and $55 million pretax, $35 million after tax in fiscal 2003. Excluding these restructuring, other exit and merger-related costs, first quarter diluted EPS would total 62 cents, up 11 percent from 56 cents in last year's first quarter. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Sanger said first quarter results met the company's expectations. "Our worldwide unit volume was up 3 percent, led by our U.S. Retail businesses. Our earnings growth also reflected productivity gains and higher joint venture earnings. These results put us on track to meet our expectations for the full year." Restructuring, Other Exit and Merger-related Costs - -------------------------------------------------- General Mills recorded certain costs in 2004 and 2003 relating to the Pillsbury acquisition. We have separately identified these costs because they represent expenses associated with an infrequently occurring event, and we believe identifying them improves the comparability of year-to-year results of operations. These costs include the restructuring and other exit costs segregated on the consolidated statements of earnings, and merger-related costs (including consulting, system conversions, relocation, training and communications) included in selling, general and administrative expense. Given the magnitude of the Pillsbury acquisition, we have consistently attempted to provide investors with information to help them distinguish the costs of the acquisition and integration from our ongoing operations. A reconciliation of earnings and EPS with and without these costs appears in the table below. Earnings -more-
and EPS excluding restructuring, other exit and merger-related costs are measures of performance that are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our net earnings and diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis. Please refer to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes for additional information regarding our classification of these items and for presentation of results in accordance with GAAP. FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS SUMMARY (in millions, except per share data) 2004 2003 ---- ---- EARNINGS AFTER TAX Before restructuring, other exit and merger-related costs $ 237 $ 211 Restructuring and other exit costs - (26) Merger-related costs (1) (10) (9) ------ ------ NET EARNINGS $ 227 $ 176 ------ ------ AVG. DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING 382 376 DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Before restructuring, other exit and merger-related costs $ .62 $ .56 Restructuring and other exit costs - (.07) Merger-related costs (1) (.03) (.02) ------ ------ DILUTED EPS $ .59 $ .47 ------ ------ (1) Included in selling, general and administrative expense U.S. Retail Segment Results - --------------------------- Net sales for General Mills' domestic retail operations grew 7 percent to $1.72 billion for the quarter, and operating profits rose 11 percent to $399 million. Unit volume grew 4 percent. The Meals division made the strongest contribution to the unit volume performance, with a 7 percent overall increase, led by Progresso soups, Green Giant -more-
vegetables and dinner mixes. Yoplait yogurt volume grew 11 percent, with good performance by core established lines and the national expansion of Nouriche yogurt beverages. Snacks unit volume grew 8 percent led by Nature Valley granola bars and Pop Secret popcorn. Pillsbury USA unit volume grew 4 percent, including gains by Totino's snacks and pizzas, Pillsbury refrigerated cookies, and frozen baked goods. Baking Products unit volume grew slightly. Big G cereal volume declined by 2 percent, compared to 6 percent growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Consumer sales trends for the company's brands were good, as combined retail sales for the company's major product lines grew 4 percent in the quarter. Bakeries and Foodservice Segment Results - ---------------------------------------- Net sales for the company's Bakeries and Foodservice operation fell 2 percent to $428 million, with unit volume down 4 percent. Operating profits totaled $29 million, down from $53 million in last year's first quarter but in line with fiscal 2003 second half performance. The decline in profits reflects lower volumes and higher supply chain costs caused by the manufacturing realignment activities currently underway. International Segment Results - ----------------------------- Net sales for General Mills' consolidated international businesses grew 17 percent to $367 million, due to currency effects and unit volume growth. Unit volume for these businesses grew by 4 percent, with gains in Canada, Asia and Europe offsetting declines in Latin America. Operating profits grew 9 percent to $24 million. -more-
Joint Venture Summary - --------------------- Earnings after tax from joint ventures totaled $20 million in the first quarter, compared to $17 million a year earlier. Profits for our Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) joint venture with Nestle and our Snack Ventures Europe (SVE) joint venture with PepsiCo together totaled $15 million, up 36 percent from the first quarter a year ago. That growth was driven by volume gains of 4 percent for CPW and 13 percent for SVE. Unit volumes for the Haagen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia declined 3 percent due to cold weather in Japan and strong prior-year new product activity. 8th Continent, the company's joint venture with Dupont, expanded distribution of its soymilk nationwide in June with encouraging initial trade response. Corporate Items - --------------- Interest expense for the quarter totaled $134 million, slightly below last year's $142 million due to lower rates. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 35 percent, consistent with the company's 2004 expectations and last year's rate. Outlook - ------- Looking ahead, Sanger said, "Our first quarter gives us a good start heading into the fall and winter seasons, our largest earnings period of the year. We expect our U.S. retail businesses to lead our growth again in the second quarter, offsetting continued weakness in Bakeries and Foodservice." -more-
Sanger said the company is on track to achieve its fiscal 2004 financial targets, which include net sales growth of 6 percent and net diluted earnings per share of $2.85 to $2.90, up from $2.43 earned in fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2004 EPS target includes Pillsbury restructuring, other exit and merger-related costs of approximately 10 to 15 cents, down from 22 cents per share last year.
