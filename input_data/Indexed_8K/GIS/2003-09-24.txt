Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Registration Statement has become effective pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the Final Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (1) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (2) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (3) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (4) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (5) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to the underwriters in such quantities as the representatives may reasonably request.

The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering. (e) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (f) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Rule 16a of the Exchange Act, in respect of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company with a maturity in excess of one year (other than the Securities) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Closing Date. (g) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities. 6.

(1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or in reports on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any capsule information), audited or unaudited, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than three Business Days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or capital stock of the Company or decreases in the stockholders' equity of the Company or in consolidated net current assets as compared with the amounts shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of the date indicated above included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date one day after the date above to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year for sales, earnings before taxes and earnings from joint ventures or in total or per share amounts of net earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and (3) the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item 302 (Supplementary Financial Information), Item 402 (Executive Compensation) and Item 503(d) (Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K; and (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions "Summary", "Risk Factors", "Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges" in the Final Prospectus, the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 2, 6, 7 and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference 12
in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated by reference in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or reports on Form 8-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter. (f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations, prospects, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus. (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change. (h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, at 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 on the Closing Date. 13
7. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. 8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the officers and directors of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the paragraph related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus. 14
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder, after taking into account the amount of damages such Underwriter is otherwise required to pay, if any. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the 15
other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in 16
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) there shall have occurred any material disruption in securities clearance or settlement services, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus. 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 12. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Attention Transaction Advisory Group (fax no.: (212) 325-4296) and confirmed to Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, 11 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010, Attention: Transaction Advisory Group and to UBS Securities LLC, Attention: Fixed Income Syndicate (fax no.: (203) 719-0495) and confirmed to UBS Securities LLC, at 677 Washington Blvd, Stamford Ct 06901, Attention: Fixed Income Syndicate; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to General Mills, Inc., General Counsel (fax no.: (763) 764-3302) and confirmed to General Mills, Inc., General Counsel, Number One General Mills Blvd., Minneapolis, Minnesota 55440, with a copy to General Mills, Inc., Treasury Department, Number One General Mills Blvd., Minneapolis, Minnesota 55440, Attn.: Treasurer (fax no.: (763) 764-7384). 13. Successors.

Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York. 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 16. Headings.

SCHEDULE II

EXHIBIT 4.1 GENERAL MILLS, INC. OFFICERS' CERTIFICATE AND AUTHENTICATION ORDER Pursuant to the Indenture dated as of February 1, 1996 (the "Indenture") between General Mills, Inc. (the "Company") and U.S. Bank National Association (formerly known as First Trust of Illinois, National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee"), and resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on December 17, 2001 and the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company on May 5, 2003, this Officers' Certificate and Authentication Order is being delivered to the Trustee to establish the terms of a series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 of the Indenture, to establish the form of the Securities of such series in accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, to request the authentication and delivery of the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture and to comply with the provisions of Section 102 of the Indenture. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein and defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture. A. ESTABLISHMENT OF SERIES PURSUANT TO SECTION 301 OF INDENTURE. There is hereby established pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture a series of Securities which shall have the following terms (the numbered clauses set forth below correspond to the numbered subsections of Section 301 of the Indenture): (1) The series of Securities being authorized shall bear the title "2 5/8% Notes due 2006" (the "Notes"). (2) There shall be no limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the Notes which may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture pursuant to this Officers' Certificate and Authentication Order shall be limited to the amount set forth in Section C below (except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Notes pursuant to Sections 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture and except for any Notes which, pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, are deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered under the Indenture). (3) Interest on each Note will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date (as defined in paragraph 5 below), except that interest due at Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom the principal of the Note is paid. (4) The Notes will mature on October 24, 2006, unless the principal of any Note, or any installment of principal, becomes due and payable prior to such date. If the date of Maturity of a Note is not a Business Day, the payment due on such day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall accrue for the
period from Maturity to that next succeeding Business Day. "Business Day" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in the Place of Payment (as defined in paragraph 6 below) are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. (5) Each Note will bear interest from and including September 24, 2003 or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) as to which interest on such Note (or any Predecessor Security with respect to such Note) has been paid or made available for payment at an annual rate of 2 5/8% until the principal of the Note is paid or made available for payment. Each payment of interest on a Note will include interest to, but excluding, as the case may be, the relevant Interest Payment Date or Maturity. The "Interest Payment Dates" for the Notes will be April 24 and October 24 of each year beginning on April 24, 2004 and the Regular Record Dates will be the April 9 or October 9, respectively, next preceding such Interest Payment Date whether or not a Business Day. If any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, the payment due on such day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall accrue for the period from such Interest Payment Date to that next succeeding Business Day. Interest (including interest for partial periods) will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. (6) Payment of principal of and premium (if any) and interest on each Note that is represented by a Global Security will be made to the Depositary (as specified in paragraph 16 below) or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole Holder of the Notes represented thereby for all purposes under the Indenture. Payment of principal of and premium (if any) and interest on each Note that is not represented by a Global Security will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Note at the office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (which shall initially be the office of the Trustee). Registered Holders that wish to receive payment in immediately available funds must provide appropriate written wire transfer instructions sufficiently in advance of the payment date and present the Note in time for the party making the payment to make payments in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures. Any wire transfer instructions received by a party making payments shall remain in effect until revoked by the registered Holder. Payment in accordance with written wire transfer instructions from a registered Holder shall be deemed to constitute full and complete payment of all amounts so paid. The Company may, at its option, elect to make payments of interest other than at Maturity by check mailed to the address of the registered Holder thereof as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date as such address appears in the Security Register. The "Place of Payment" with respect to the Notes shall be the City of New York. 2
(7) The Company may not redeem the Notes at its option prior to maturity. (8) The Company shall have no obligation to redeem or repurchase any Notes either pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of any Holder thereof. (15) The Notes shall be defeasible, in whole or any specified part, pursuant to Section 1302 or Section 1303 of the Indenture or both such Sections. (16) The Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. The Depositary with respect to such Global Securities shall be The Depository Trust Company. The Global Securities shall bear the legends set forth on the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A. Except as provided in the clause (2) of the last paragraph of Section 305 of the Indenture, such Global Security may not be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of such Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name or names of Persons other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof. So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered holder of any Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole Holder of the Notes represented by such Global Security for all purposes under the Notes and the Indenture. B. ESTABLISHMENT OF FORM OF SECURITIES PURSUANT TO SECTION 201 OF THE INDENTURE. In accordance with Section 201 of the Indenture, the form attached hereto as Exhibit A is hereby established as the form to represent the Notes. C. ORDER FOR THE AUTHENTICATION AND DELIVERY OF SECURITIES PURSUANT TO SECTION 303 OF THE Indenture. Pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, you are hereby requested, as Trustee under the Indenture, to authenticate, in the manner provided by the Indenture, $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes registered in the name of Cede & Co., which Notes have been heretofore duly executed by the proper officers of the Company and delivered to you as provided in the Indenture, and to deliver said authenticated Notes to Credit Suisse First Boston LLC and UBS Securities LLC through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company against payment therefor on September 24, 2003.

[REVERSE OF NOTE] GENERAL MILLS, INC. 2 5/8% NOTES DUE 2006 This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of February 1, 1996 (herein called the "Indenture", which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (f.k.a. First Trust of Illinois, National Association), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. By the terms of the Indenture, additional Securities of other separate series, which may vary as to date, amount, Stated Maturity, interest rate or method of calculating the interest rate and in other respects as therein provided, may be issued in an unlimited principal amount. This Note is one of a series of the Securities designated as 2 5/8% Notes Due 2006 (the "Notes"). In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the unpaid principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. The Company may not redeem this Note at its option prior to Maturity. The Company may, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, issue additional Securities having the same ranking and the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as the Notes. Any additional Securities having the same terms, together with these Notes, will constitute a single series of Notes under the Indenture. No such additional Securities may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred with respect to these Notes. 9
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of either the entire principal of the Notes or of certain covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Notes, in either case upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. [This Note is exchangeable for definitive Notes only if (x) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Global Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (y) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that this Note shall be so exchangeable or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Notes represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. In such case, this Global Security shall be exchangeable into Notes issuable only in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. No Notes shall be issuable in denominations of less than $1,000. If this Note is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentences, it shall be exchangeable for definitive Notes, bearing interest at the same rate, having the same date of issuance, redemption provisions, Stated Maturity and other terms in registered form and of differing denominations aggregating a like amount.] As provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations herein and therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. No Notes will be issuable in denominations of less than $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to the limitations herein and therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes and of like tenor in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. 10
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the places, at the respective times and at the rate herein prescribed. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute 11
any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the absolute owner of this Note at such holder's address as it appears on the Security Register (whether or not this Note shall be overdue) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account hereof and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All payments made to or upon the order of such registered holder shall, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, effectually satisfy and discharge liability for moneys payable on this Note. No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or in any indenture supplemental thereto or any Note, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, or against any past, present or future stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such personal liability of every such incorporator, stockholder, officer and director, as such, being expressly waived and released by acceptance hereof and as a condition of and as part of the consideration for the issuance of this Note.

EXHIBIT 5.1 September 24, 2003 General Mills, Inc. Number One General Mills Boulevard Minneapolis, Minnesota 55426 Re: Registration Statement on Form S-3 333-75808 Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of General Mills, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (the "Company"), and I and those under my supervision have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") relating to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of debt securities of the Company having an aggregate initial offering price of $8,000,000,000 to be offered from time to time and a Prospectus Supplement dated September 17, 2003 to Prospectus dated February 11, 2002 (together the "Prospectus Supplement") relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the Registration Statement of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2 5/8 % Notes due 2006 (the "2 5/8 % Notes"). The 2 5/8 % Notes are to be issued under an Indenture dated as of February 1, 1996 (the "Indenture") between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (formerly known as First Trust of Illinois, National Association), as Trustee (the "Trustee") and sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated September 17, 2003 (the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and Credit Suisse First Boston LLC and UBS Securities LLC. I or those under my supervision have examined such documents and have reviewed such questions of law as I have deemed necessary and appropriate for the purposes of furnishing this opinion. In rendering my opinion, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. I have also assumed the legal capacity for all purposes relevant hereto of all natural persons and, with respect to all parties to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company, that such parties had the requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise), executed and delivered by such parties and that such agreements or instruments are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such parties. I have relied as to matters of fact (but not to legal conclusion), to the extent I deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials. Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the 2 5/8 % Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in the manner specified in
General Mills, Inc. September 24, 2003 Page 2 the Indenture and delivered against payment therefore pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms. The opinion set forth above is subject to the following qualifications and exceptions: (a) My opinion is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar law of general application affecting creditors' rights. (b) My opinion is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including (without limitation) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and other similar doctrines affecting the enforceability of agreements generally (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (c) I express no opinion as to the enforceability of (i) provisions that relate to choice of law; (ii) waivers by the Company of any statutory or constitutional rights or remedies; or (iii) terms which excuse any person or entity from liability for, or require the Company to indemnify such person or entity against, such person's or entity's negligence or willful misconduct. (d) I draw your attention to the fact that, under certain circumstances, the enforceability of terms to the effect that provisions may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited. My opinion expressed above is limited to the federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the Delaware General Corporation Law. I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to myself under the caption "Validity of Notes" in the Prospectus Supplement. Very truly yours, /s/ Siri S. Marshall Siri S. Marshall
