Interest and fees shall accrue during each period during which interest or such fees are computed from the first day thereof to the last day thereof. (b) The Administrative Agent will, with reasonable promptness, notify the Company and the Banks of each determination of an Offshore Rate; provided that any failure to do so shall not relieve the Company of any liability hereunder or provide the basis for any claim against the Administrative Agent. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage shall become effective and shall apply to any Loans then outstanding as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent will with reasonable promptness notify the Company and the Banks of the effective date and the amount of each such change, PROVIDED that any failure to do so shall not relieve the Company of any liability hereunder or provide the basis for any claim against the Administrative Agent. (c) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant hereto shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and the Banks in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent will, at the request of the Company or any Bank, deliver to the Company or the Bank, as the case may be, a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate. Section 2.11. PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY. (a) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Company on account of principal, interest, fees and other amounts required hereunder shall be made without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim; shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Banks at the Administrative Agent's Payment Office, and shall be made in dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute on such date to each Bank its Commitment Percentage (or other applicable share as expressly provided herein) of such principal, interest, fees or other amounts, in like funds as received. Any payment which is received by the Administrative Agent later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) shall be deemed to have been received on the immediately succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. (b) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the 23
computation of interest or fees, as the case may be; subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of "Interest Period" herein. (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Company will not make such payment in full as and when required hereunder, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the Company shall not have made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Bank, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate as in effect for each such day. Section 2.12. PAYMENTS BY THE BANKS TO THE AGENT. (a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank on the Closing Date or, with respect to each Borrowing after the Closing Date, prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of any proposed Borrowing, that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent as and when required hereunder for the account of the Company the amount of that Bank's Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that each Bank has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds on the Borrowing date and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Bank shall not have made its full amount available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent in such circumstances has made available to the Company such amount, that Bank shall on the next Business Day following the date of such Borrowing make such amount available to the Administrative Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for and determined as of each day during such period. A notice given by the Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to amounts owing under this subsection 2.12(a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount is so made available, such payment to the Administrative Agent shall constitute such Bank's Loan on the date of Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent on the next Business Day following the date of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, the Company shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent's account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing. 24
(b) The failure of any Bank to make any Loan on any date of borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on the date of such borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of any borrowing. Section 2.13. SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Bank shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or the Letter of Credit Liabilities held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its Commitment Percentage of payments on account of the Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Loans made by them and the Letter of Credit Liabilities held by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Bank, such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Bank's Commitment Percentage (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Bank's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Company agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 10.10) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased pursuant to this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Banks following any such purchases or repayments. Section 2.14. LETTERS OF CREDIT. (a) COMMITMENT TO ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Issuing Bank agrees to issue Letters of Credit from time to time up to 30 days prior to the Revolving Termination Date upon the request of the Company; provided that, immediately after each Letter of Credit is issued (i) the Total Outstanding Amount shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment and (ii) the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Liabilities shall not exceed $100,000,000. Upon the date of issuance by an Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have sold to each Bank, and each Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have purchased from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit and the related Letter of Credit Liabilities in the proportion its Revolving Commitment bears to the Aggregate Revolving Commitment. (b) METHOD FOR ISSUANCE; TERMS; EXTENSIONS. 25
(i) The Company shall give the Issuing Bank notice at least three Business Days (or such shorter notice as may be acceptable to the Issuing Bank in its discretion) prior to the requested issuance of a Letter of Credit (or, in the case of renewal or extension, prior to the Issuing Bank's deadline for notice of nonextension) specifying the date such Letter of Credit is to be issued, and describing the terms of such Letter of Credit and the nature of the transactions to be supported thereby (such notice, including any such notice given in connection with the extension of a Letter of Credit, a "NOTICE OF ISSUANCE"). Upon receipt of a Notice of Issuance, the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of the amount of such Bank's participation in such Letter of Credit. (ii) The obligation of any Issuing Bank to issue each Letter of Credit shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02, be subject to the conditions precedent that such Letter of Credit shall be in such form and contain such terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Bank and that the Company shall have executed and delivered such other customary instruments and agreements relating to such Letter of Credit as the Issuing Bank shall have reasonably requested; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any Issuing Bank may decline to issue any Letter of Credit at such Issuing Bank's sole discretion (including, without limitation, if such Issuing Bank's internal policies do not permit the issuance of a letter of credit for the purposes for which such Letter of Credit is being requested). The Company shall also pay to the Issuing Bank for its own account issuance, drawing, amendment, settlement and extension charges, if any, in the amounts and at the times as agreed between the Company and the Issuing Bank. (iii) The extension or renewal of any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be an issuance of such Letter of Credit, and if any Letter of Credit contains a provision pursuant to which it is deemed to be extended unless notice of termination is given by the Issuing Bank, the Issuing Bank shall timely give such notice of termination unless it has theretofore timely received a Notice of Issuance and the other conditions to issuance of a Letter of Credit have also theretofore been met with respect to such extension. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or before the close of business on the date that is one year after such Letter of Credit is issued (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension); PROVIDED that (A) a Letter of Credit may contain a provision pursuant to which it is deemed to be extended on an annual basis unless notice of termination is given by the Issuing Bank and (B) in no event will a Letter of Credit expire (including pursuant to a renewal or extension thereof) on a date later than the fifth Business Day prior to the Revolving Termination Date. 26
(c) PAYMENTS; REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS. (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and each other Bank as to the amount to be paid as a result of such demand or drawing and the date such payment is to be made by the Issuing Bank (the "PAYMENT DATE"). The Company shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any amounts paid by the Issuing Bank upon any drawing under any Letter of Credit, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind. Such reimbursement shall be due on the Payment Date; PROVIDED that no such payment shall be due from the Company any earlier than the date of receipt by it of notice of its obligation to make such payment (or, if such notice is received by the Company after 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on any date, on the next succeeding Business Day); and PROVIDED FURTHER that if and to the extent any such reimbursement is not made by the Company in accordance with this clause (i) or clause (ii) below on the Payment Date, then (irrespective of when notice thereof is received by the Company), such Reimbursement Obligation shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day from and including the Payment Date to but not including the date such Reimbursement Obligation is paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day. (ii) If the Revolving Commitments remain in effect on the Payment Date, all such amounts paid by the Issuing Bank and remaining unpaid by the Company after the date and time required by Section 2.14(c)(i) (a "REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION") shall, if and to the extent that the amount of such Reimbursement Obligation would be permitted as a Borrowing pursuant to Section 4.02, and unless the Company otherwise instructs the Administrative Agent by not less than one Business Day's prior notice, convert automatically to Base Rate Loans on the date such Reimbursement Obligation arises. The Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the Company (which hereby irrevocably directs the Administrative Agent so to act on its behalf), give notice no later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on such date requesting each Bank to make, and each Bank hereby agrees to make, a Base Rate Loan, in an amount equal to such Bank's PRO RATA share of the Reimbursement Obligation with respect to which such notice relates. Each Bank shall make such Loan available to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 10.02 in immediately available funds, not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time), on the date specified in such notice. The Administrative Agent shall pay the proceeds of such Loans to the Issuing Bank, which shall immediately apply such proceeds to repay the Reimbursement Obligation. 27
(iii) To the extent a Reimbursement Obligation is not funded by a Bank pursuant to clause (ii) above, such Bank will pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, immediately upon the Issuing Bank's demand at any time during the period commencing after such Reimbursement Obligation arises until reimbursement therefor in full by the Company, an amount equal to such Bank's pro rata share of such Reimbursement Obligation, together with interest on such amount for each day from the date of the Issuing Bank's demand for such payment (or, if such demand is made after 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such date, from the next succeeding Business Day) to the date of payment by such Bank of such amount at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for the first three Business Days after the date of such demand and thereafter at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for each additional day. The Issuing Bank will pay to each Bank ratably all amounts received from the Company for application in payment of its Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any Letter of Credit, but only to the extent such Bank has made payment to the Issuing Bank in respect of such Letter of Credit pursuant hereto; PROVIDED that in the event such payment received by the Issuing Bank is required to be returned, such Bank will return to the Issuing Bank any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Issuing Bank. (d) OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The obligations of the Company and each Bank under subsection (c) above shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under all circumstances whatsoever, including without limitation the following circumstances: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or thereto; (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the provisions of this Agreement or any Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or thereto, provided by any party affected thereby; (iii) the use which may be made of the Letter of Credit by, or any acts or omission of, a beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom the beneficiary may be acting); (iv) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other rights that the Company may have at any time against a beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom the beneficiary may be acting), any Bank (including the Issuing Bank) or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement or the Letter of Credit or any document related hereto or thereto or any unrelated transaction; 28
(v) any statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever; (vi) payment under a Letter of Credit against presentation to the Issuing Bank of documents that do not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (vii) any termination of the Commitments prior to, on or after the Payment Date for any Letter of Credit, whether at the scheduled termination thereof, by operation of Article 8 or otherwise; or (viii) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any Bank (including the Issuing Bank), the Administrative Agent or any other Person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this subsection (viii), constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defense to the Company's or the Bank's obligations hereunder; PROVIDED, that this Section 2.14(d) shall not limit the rights of the Company or any Bank under Section 2.14(e)(ii). (e) INDEMNIFICATION; EXPENSES. (i) The Company hereby indemnifies and holds harmless each Bank (including each Issuing Bank) and the Administrative Agent from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur in connection with a Letter of Credit issued pursuant to this Section 2.14; PROVIDED that the Company shall not be required to indemnify any Bank or the Administrative Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses, to the extent finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person. (ii) None of the Banks (including, subject to subsection (f) below, an Issuing Bank) nor the Administrative Agent nor any of their officers or directors or employees or agents shall be liable or responsible, by reason of or in connection with the execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any Letter of Credit, including without limitation any of the circumstances enumerated in subsection (d) above; PROVIDED that, notwithstanding Section 2.14(d), the Company shall have a claim for direct (but not consequential) damage suffered by it, to the extent finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by (x) the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (y) the Issuing Bank's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of 29
documents strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit; PROVIDED FURTHER that each Bank shall have a claim for direct (but not consequential) damage suffered by it, to the extent finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit complied with the terms of such Letter of Credit. The parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. (iii) Nothing in this subsection (e) is intended to limit the obligations of the Company under any other provision of this Agreement. To the extent the Company does not indemnify an Issuing Bank as required by this subsection, the Banks agree to do so ratably in accordance with their Revolving Commitments. (f) STOP ISSUANCE NOTICE. If the Majority Banks determine at any time that the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 would not be satisfied in respect of a Borrowing at such time, then the Majority Banks may request that the Administrative Agent issue a "STOP ISSUANCE NOTICE", and the Administrative Agent shall issue such notice to each Issuing Bank. Such Stop Issuance Notice shall be withdrawn upon a determination by the Majority Banks that the circumstances giving rise thereto no longer exist. No Letter of Credit shall be issued while a Stop Issuance Notice is in effect. The Majority Banks may request issuance of a Stop Issuance Notice only if there is a reasonable basis therefor, and shall consider reasonably and in good faith a request from the Company for withdrawal of the same on the basis that the conditions in Section 4.02 are satisfied; PROVIDED that the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks may and shall conclusively rely upon any Stop Issuance Notice while it remains in effect. (g) OTHER DOCUMENTATION. If the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Company to or entered into by the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit are not consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control; PROVIDED that, to the extent the Issuing Bank so agrees in such other documentation, its liabilities and responsibilities in connection with a Letter of Credit may be governed thereby rather than by subsection (e)(ii), but such agreement by the Issuing Bank may not directly or indirectly alter the rights and obligations of any other Bank under this Agreement. 30
ARTICLE 3 TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY Section 3.01. TAXES. (a) Subject to subsection 3.01(g), any and all payments by the Company to each Bank or Agent under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank and Agent, such taxes (including income taxes or franchise taxes) as are imposed on or measured by each Bank's net income by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or Agent, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). (b) In addition, the Company shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES"). If any Bank becomes aware of the imposition of Other Taxes, it shall promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent thereof. (c) Subject to subsection 3.01(g), the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Bank and Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.01) paid by such Bank or Agent and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Bank or Agent makes written demand therefor. (d) If the Company shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Bank or Agent, then, subject to subsection 3.01(g): (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) such Bank or Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made; (ii) the Company shall make such deductions; and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. 31
(e) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Company of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Company shall furnish to the Administrative Agent evidence of payment satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (f) Each Bank which is a foreign person (i.e., a person other than a United States person for United States Federal income tax purposes) agrees that: (i) it shall, no later than the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Bank which becomes a party hereto pursuant to Section 10.08 after the Closing Date, the date upon which the Bank becomes a party hereto) deliver to the Company through the Administrative Agent two accurate and complete signed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto ("FORM W-8ECI"), or two accurate and complete signed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto ("FORM W-8BEN"), as appropriate, in each case indicating that the Bank is on the date of delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of principal, interest and fees under this Agreement free from withholding of United States Federal income tax; (ii) if at any time the Bank makes any changes necessitating a new Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN, it shall with reasonable promptness deliver to the Company through the Administrative Agent in replacement for, or in addition to, the forms previously delivered by it hereunder, two accurate and complete signed originals of Form W-8ECI; or two accurate and complete signed originals of Form W-8BEN, as appropriate, in each case indicating that the Bank is on the date of delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of principal, interest and fees under this Agreement free from withholding of United States Federal income tax; (iii) it shall, before or promptly after the occurrence of any event (including the passing of time but excluding any event mentioned in (ii) above) requiring a change in or renewal of the most recent Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN previously delivered by such Bank, deliver to the Company through the Administrative Agent two accurate and complete original signed copies of Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN in replacement for the forms previously delivered by the Bank; and (iv) it shall, promptly upon the Company's or the Administrative Agent's reasonable request to that effect, deliver to the Company or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) such other forms or similar documentation as may be required from time to time by any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation in order to establish such Bank's tax status for withholding purposes. (g) The Company will not be required to pay any additional amounts in respect of United States Federal income tax pursuant to subsection 3.01(d) to any Bank for the account of any Lending Office of such Bank: 32
(i) if the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Bank to comply with its obligations under subsection 3.01(f) in respect of such Lending Office; (ii) if such Bank shall have delivered to the Company a Form W-8ECI in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to subsection 3.01(f), and such Bank shall not at any time be entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of United States Federal income tax in respect of payments by the Company hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in United States law or regulations or in the official interpretation of such law or regulations by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form W-8ECI; or (iii) if the Bank shall have delivered to the Company a Form W-8BEN in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to subsection 3.01(f), and such Bank shall not at any time be entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of United States Federal income tax in respect of payments by the Company hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in United States law or regulations or any applicable tax treaty or regulations or in the official interpretation of any such law, treaty or regulations by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form W-8BEN. (h) If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to any Bank or Agent pursuant to subsection 3.01(b) or 3.01(d), then such Bank shall use its reasonable best efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office or to take other reasonable action so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the Company which may thereafter accrue if such change or action in the judgment of such Bank is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. Section 3.02. ILLEGALITY. (a) If any Bank shall reasonably determine, based upon the advice of its counsel, that the introduction of any Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or administration thereof, has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its Lending Office to make Offshore Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof by the Bank to the Company through the Administrative Agent, the obligation of that Bank to make Offshore Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Bank shall have notified the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. 33
(b) If a Bank shall reasonably determine, based upon the advice of its counsel, that it is unlawful to maintain any Offshore Rate Loan, the Company shall prepay in full all Offshore Rate Loans of that Bank then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof if the Bank may lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans, together with any amounts required to be paid in connection therewith pursuant to Section 3.04. (c) If the Company is required to prepay any Offshore Rate Loan immediately as provided in subsection 3.02(b), then concurrently with such prepayment, the Company shall borrow from the affected Bank, in the amount of such repayment, a Base Rate Loan. (d) If the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Offshore Rate Loans has been suspended as provided in subsection 3.02(a), the Company may elect, by giving notice to the Bank through the Administrative Agent that all Loans which would otherwise be made by the Bank as Offshore Rate Loans shall be instead Base Rate Loans. (e) Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.02, the affected Bank shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to its Offshore Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of the Bank, be illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Bank. Section 3.03. INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCTION OF RETURN. (a) If on or after the date hereof any Bank shall determine that, due to and as a direct result of either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included in the calculation of the Offshore Rate) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining its Revolving Commitment hereunder or any Offshore Rate Loans, or of agreeing to issue or participate in or issuing or participating in any Letters of Credit, then the Company shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon demand therefor by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased costs. (b) If after the date hereof any Bank shall have determined that (i) the introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or (iv) compliance by such Bank (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling such Bank, with any Capital Adequacy Regulation; affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any corporation controlling 34
such Bank and (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Bank's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its Revolving Commitment, loans, credits or obligations under this Agreement (including its obligations in respect of Letters of Credit), then, upon demand of such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall upon demand pay to such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increase. (c) If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to any Bank pursuant to subsection 3.03(a) or (b), then such Bank shall use its reasonable best efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office with respect to its Offshore Rate Loans so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the Company which may thereafter accrue if such change in the judgment of such Bank is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. Section 3.04. FUNDING LOSSES. The Company agrees to reimburse each Bank and to hold each Bank harmless from any loss or out-of-pocket expense which such Bank may sustain or incur as a direct consequence of: (a) the failure of the Company to make on a timely basis any payment of principal of any Offshore Rate Loan (including payments made after any acceleration thereof); (b) the failure of the Company to borrow, continue or convert a Loan after the Company has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation; (c) the failure of the Company to make any prepayment after the Company has given a notice in accordance with Section 2.06; (d) any principal payment in respect of an Offshore Rate Loan on a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto; or (e) the conversion pursuant to Section 2.04 of any Offshore Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the respective Interest Period; including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain its Offshore Rate Loans hereunder or from standard fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Solely for purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Banks under this Section 3.04, each Offshore Rate Loan made by a Bank (and each related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively 35
deemed to have been funded at the Offshore Base Rate used in determining the Offshore Rate for such Offshore Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Offshore Rate Loan is in fact so funded. Section 3.05. INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Administrative Agent shall have determined (i) that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Offshore Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Offshore Rate Loan or (ii) that the Offshore Rate applicable pursuant to subsection 2.08(a) for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Offshore Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Bank of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will forthwith give notice of such determination to the Company and each Bank. Thereafter, the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Offshore Rate Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice in writing.

Section 5.04. BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement and each other Loan Document to which the Company is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.

Section 5.06. NO DEFAULT. No Default or Event of Default exists or would result from the incurring of any Obligations by the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation in any respect which, individually or together with all such defaults, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or that would, if such default had occurred after the Closing Date, create an Event of Default under subsection 8.01(e). Section 5.07. ERISA. (a) There is no outstanding liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Qualified Plan maintained or sponsored by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, nor with respect to any Qualified Plan to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate contributes or is obligated to contribute, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 40
(b) No Qualified Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has any Unfunded Pension Liability in excess of $25,000,000 in the aggregate.

(e) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has transferred any Unfunded Pension Liability to a Person other than the Company or an ERISA Affiliate or otherwise engaged in a transaction that could be subject to Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA and which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is generally engaged in the business of purchasing or selling Margin Stock or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock. Section 5.09. TITLE TO PROPERTIES. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have good record and marketable title in fee simple to, or valid leasehold interests in, all real Property necessary or used in the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses, except for such defects in title as could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

There is no proposed tax assessment against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which would, if the assessment were made, have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 5.11. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company conducts evaluations of the effect of Environmental Laws 41
on the business, operations and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with the risks posed and the nature of its operations, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of properties presently or previously owned, any capital or operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any related constraints on operating activities, including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of operations conducted thereat and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any related costs and expenses). On the basis of these evaluations, the Company has reasonably concluded that Environmental Laws are unlikely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 5.12. REGULATED ENTITIES.

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if no Loan or Letter of Credit is outstanding at the time any event or circumstance specified in paragraph (b), (c), (d), (h) or (i) of this Section 8.01 shall occur or arise, then any such event or circumstance shall not be deemed an Event of Default, but the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with the consent of, the Majority Banks, declare the Revolving Commitment of each Bank to make Loans and the obligation of each Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit to be terminated, whereupon such Revolving Commitments and the obligation of each Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit shall forthwith be terminated and the Company shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent all accrued but unpaid amounts then outstanding under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; provided further, however, that: (i) the Company shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and each Bank of any such event or circumstance, and (ii) the obligation of each Bank to make any Loan hereunder or to issue any Letter of Credit shall be immediately suspended for so long as any such event or circumstance shall continue to exist. Section 8.02. REMEDIES.

Section 8.03. CASH COVER. The Company agrees, in addition to the provisions in Sections 8.01 and 8.02, that upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, it shall, if requested by the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the Majority Banks or any Issuing Bank having an outstanding Letter of Credit, pay to the Administrative Agent an amount in immediately available funds (which shall be held as collateral pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) equal to the aggregate amount available for drawing under all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time (or, in the case of a request by an Issuing Bank, all such Letters of Credit issued by it), PROVIDED that, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in clause (f) or (g) above with respect to the Company, and on the Revolving Termination Date, the Company shall pay such amount forthwith without any notice or demand or any other act by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Bank. Amounts so held shall be invested by the Administrative Agent upon the instruction and for the account of the Company in short-term U.S. government securities. Section 8.04. RIGHTS NOT EXCLUSIVE. The rights provided for in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights, powers, privileges or remedies provided by law or in equity, or under any other instrument, document or agreement now existing or hereafter arising. ARTICLE 9 THE AGENTS Section 9.01. APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION. Each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. Section 9.02. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative 54
Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care. Section 9.03. LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. None of the Administrative Agent-Related Persons shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other Loan Document (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Company or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Administrative Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the Properties, books or records of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Section 9.04. RELIANCE BY AGENT. (a) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Banks as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Majority Banks and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Banks. (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.01, each Bank that has executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with each document or other matter either sent by the Administrative Agent to such Bank for 55
consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Bank. Section 9.05. NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Bank or the Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be requested by the Majority Banks in accordance with Article 8; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received any such request, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Banks. Section 9.06. CREDIT DECISION. Each Bank expressly acknowledges that none of the Administrative Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated thereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and extend credit to the Company hereunder. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Company which may come into the possession of any of the Administrative Agent-Related Persons. 56
Section 9.07. INDEMNIFICATION. The Banks shall indemnify upon demand the Administrative Agent-Related Persons and any Issuing Bank (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Company and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments, or if no Revolving Commitments are in effect, in accordance with their respective outstanding Loans, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following the repayment of the Loans and the termination or resignation of the Administrative Agent) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any document contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by any such Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Bank shall be liable for the payment to the Administrative Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the Administrative Agent and any Issuing Bank upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Bank (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Bank failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Bank shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses and attorneys' fees (including Attorney Costs). The obligation of the Banks in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder. Section 9.08. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. JPMorgan Chase and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though JPMorgan Chase were not 57
the Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Banks. The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, JPMorgan Chase or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Company or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Company or such Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, JPMorgan Chase shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include JPMorgan Chase in its individual capacity. Section 9.09. SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the Company shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks (unless an Event of Default then exists in which case the Majority Banks shall appoint the successor agent). If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Banks and the Company, a successor agent from among the Banks. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article 9 and Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Company or the Majority Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for above. Section 9.10. OTHER AGENTS. None of the Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agents shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Banks as such. Each Bank acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on the Syndication Agent in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder. 58
ARTICLE 10 MISCELLANEOUS Section 10.01. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent with respect to any departure by the Company therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Banks, the Company (and if the rights or duties of any Issuing Bank are affected thereby, by it) and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and then such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Banks, the Company and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, do any of the following: (a) extend or increase the Revolving Commitment of any Bank (or reinstate any Revolving Commitment terminated pursuant to subsection 8.02(a)) or subject any Bank to any additional obligations; (b) postpone or delay any date fixed for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Banks (or any of them) hereunder, under any Loan Document, or the latest permitted expiry date for Letters of Credit; (c) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on any Loan, or any Reimbursement Obligation or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any Loan Document; (d) change the percentage of the Revolving Commitments or of the Total Outstanding Amount, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action hereunder or change the definition of Majority Banks; (e) amend this Section 10.01 or any provision providing for consent or other action by all Banks; or (f) alter the pro rata treatment of the Banks under Section 2.13 or any other provision providing for pro rata treatment; and, PROVIDED FURTHER, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by such Agent in addition to the Majority Banks or all the Banks, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of any Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Section 10.02. NOTICES. (a) All notices, requests and other communications provided for hereunder to any party shall be in writing (including, unless the context expressly otherwise provides, by facsimile transmission, provided that any matter transmitted by the Company by facsimile (i) shall be immediately confirmed by a telephone call to the recipient at the number specified on the signature pages hereof or in the applicable Administrative Questionnaire, as the 59
case may be, and (ii) shall be followed promptly by a hard copy original thereof) and mailed, faxed or delivered, to such party: (A) in the case of the Company or the Administrative Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (B) in the case of any Bank, at its address or facsimile number set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire, or (C) in the case of any party, at such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company. (b) All such notices, requests and communications shall, when transmitted by overnight delivery, or faxed, be effective when delivered for overnight (next-day) delivery, or transmitted by facsimile machine, respectively, or if mailed, upon the third Business Day after the date deposited into the U.S. mail, or if delivered, upon delivery; except that notices to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank pursuant to Article 2 or 9 shall not be effective until actually received by it. (c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Banks in Article 2 herein to receive certain notices by telephone and facsimile is solely for the convenience and at the request of the Company. The Administrative Agent and the Banks shall be entitled to rely on the authority of any Person purporting to be a Person authorized by the Company to give such notice and the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall not have any liability to the Company or other Person on account of any action taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. The obligation of the Company to repay the Loans shall not be affected in any way or to any extent by any failure by the Administrative Agent and the Banks to receive written confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice or the receipt by the Administrative Agent and the Banks of a confirmation which is at variance with the terms understood by the Administrative Agent and the Banks to be contained in the telephonic or facsimile notice. Section 10.03. NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of any Agent or Bank, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Section 10.04. COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Company shall, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated: (a) pay or reimburse JPMorgan Chase (including in its capacity as Administrative Agent) within fifteen Business Days after demand (subject to subsection 4.01(e)) for all reasonable, demonstrable costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by JPMorgan Chase (including in its capacity as Administrative Agent) in connection with the development, preparation, delivery and execution of, and any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to (in each case, whether 60
or not consummated), this Agreement, any Loan Document and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable Attorney Costs incurred by JPMorgan Chase (including in its capacity as Administrative Agent) with respect thereto as agreed in the Fee Letters; and (b) pay or reimburse each Bank and the Administrative Agent within fifteen Business Days after demand (subject to subsection 4.01(e)) for all costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or remedies (including in connection with any "workout" or restructuring regarding the Loans, and including in any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) under this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document, and any such other documents, including Attorney Costs incurred by the Administrative Agent and any Bank or Issuing Bank. Section 10.05. INDEMNITY. (a) The Company shall pay, indemnify, and hold each Bank and Agent and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (each, an "Indemnified Person") harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses or disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, any Letter of Credit and any other Loan Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and with respect to any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) related to this Agreement, the Loans, any Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); PROVIDED, that the Company shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. The agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all other Obligations and termination of this Agreement. (b) An Indemnified Person shall give prompt notice to the Company of any claim asserted in writing, or the commencement of any action or proceeding, in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, provided that the omission so to notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability, if any, which it may have to the Indemnified Person otherwise than under Section 10.05(a) unless and to the extent that the Company shall have been materially damaged by the delay in notification or the failure to be notified. (c) The Indemnified Person shall assist the Company in the defense of any such action or proceeding by arranging discussions with (and the calling as witnesses of) relevant officers, directors, employees and agents of the Indemnified Person and providing reasonable access to relevant books and records. The 61
Company shall have the right to, and shall at the request of the Indemnified Person, participate in, and assume the defense of, any such action or proceeding at its own expense using counsel mutually acceptable to the Company and the Indemnified Person. In any such action or proceeding which the Company has participated in or assumed the defense of, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain separate counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at its own expense unless the named parties to any such suit, action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Company and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. (d) The Company shall not be liable under Section 10.05 for any settlement effected without its consent of any claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder. The Company may settle any claim without the consent of the Indemnified Person if monetary damages are paid in full by the Company, PROVIDED, that the Company shall not make any admission of wrongdoing by such Indemnified Person and all claimants shall execute a full release in favor of such Indemnified Person. An Indemnified Person shall, subject to its reasonable business needs, use reasonable efforts to minimize the indemnification sought from the Company under Section 10.05. Section 10.06. MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Banks shall be under any obligation to marshall any assets in favor of the Company or any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or the Banks, or the Administrative Agent or the Banks exercise their rights of set-off, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Banks) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding, or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Bank severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its ratable share of the total amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent. Section 10.07. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Company may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Bank (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Company without such consent shall be null and void). 62
Section 10.08. ASSIGNMENTS, PARTICIPATIONS, ETC. (a) Any Bank may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment, Letter of Credit Liabilities, and the Loans at the time owing to it); PROVIDED THAT (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Bank's Revolving Commitment, Letter of Credit Liabilities, and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund with respect to a Bank, the amount of the Revolving Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans and Letter of Credit Liabilities outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, as hereinafter defined, with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans, the Letter of Credit Liabilities, and/or the Revolving Commitment assigned and (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto (an "ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT"), together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Bank, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.02(a), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, and the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement covering all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.03, 10.04, and 10.05). Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section. (b) Any Bank may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Company or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment, the Loans and/or the Letter of Credit Liabilities at the time owing to it); PROVIDED THAT (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of 63
such obligations and (iii) the Company, the Administrative Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (a), (b) or (c) of Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c) of this Section, the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 and 3.04 to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section. (c) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.03 than the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent. A Participant organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section 3.01(f) as though it were a Bank. (d) Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank (a "GRANTING BANK") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Company (an "SPC"), the option to provide to the Company all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to the Company pursuant to this Agreement; PROVIDED THAT (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii) the Granting Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged and (iii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Revolving Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Bank). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement 64
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.08, any SPC may with notice to, but without (except as specified below) the prior written consent of, the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Bank or to any financial institution (consented to by the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred, the Company, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans. Any SPC shall be a Transferee for purposes of Section 10.09 hereof, provided that in addition to disclosures permitted pursuant to Section 10.09, an SPC may disclose on a basis acknowledged by the recipient as confidential any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. An amendment to this subsection (e) without the written consent of an SPC shall be ineffective insofar as it alters the rights and obligations of such SPC. Section 10.09. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Bank agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care (in the same manner as it exercises for its own affairs) to maintain the confidentiality of all information identified as "confidential" by the Company and provided to it by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or by the Administrative Agent on such Company's or Subsidiary's behalf, in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such information for any purpose or in any manner other than pursuant to the terms contemplated by this Agreement; except to the extent such information (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by such Bank, or (ii) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company known to such Bank; provided further, however, that any Bank may disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of any Governmental Authority to which such Bank is subject or in connection with an examination of such Bank by any such authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or other court process, provided that the Company is given prompt notice of such 65
subpoena or other process (unless such Bank is legally prohibited from giving such notice); (C) when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (D) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which any Agent, any Bank or their respective Affiliates may be party; (E) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document; and (F) to such Bank's independent auditors and other professional advisors as may be reasonably required in order for any party to fulfill its obligations, provided further, that such auditors or advisors shall be informed of the confidentiality requirements of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant or Assignee (each, a "TRANSFEREE") and to any prospective Transferee or to any actual or prospective contractual counterparty (or its advisors) to any securitization, hedge or other derivative transaction, such financial and other information in such Bank's possession concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries which has been delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Banks pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Banks by the Company in connection with the Bank's credit evaluation of the Company prior to entering into this Agreement; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the Company, such Person agrees in writing to such Bank to keep such information confidential to the same extent required of the Banks hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any party hereto (and any employee, representative or other agent of thereof) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. However, no disclosure of any information relating to such tax treatment or tax structure may be made to the extent nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws. Section 10.10. SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by law, if an Event of Default exists, each Bank is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Company, any such notice being waived by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing to, such Bank or any 66
of its Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the Company against any and all Obligations owing to such Bank or Affiliate, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Bank shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Company and the Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Bank or Affiliate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Bank under this Section 10.10 are in addition to the other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) which the Bank may have. Section 10.11. NOTIFICATION OF ADDRESSES, LENDING OFFICES, ETC. Each Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any changes in the address to which notices to the Bank should be directed, of addresses of its Offshore Lending Office, of payment instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it hereunder and of such other administrative information as the Agent shall reasonably request. Section 10.12. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement in any number of separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute but one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Company and the Administrative Agent. Section 10.13. SEVERABILITY. The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder. Section 10.14. NO THIRD PARTIES BENEFITED. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Company, the Banks and the Agents, and their permitted successors and assigns, and no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any direct or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. No Agent or Bank shall have any obligation to any Person not a party to this Agreement or other Loan Documents. Section 10.15. TIME. Time is of the essence as to each term or provision of this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents. Section 10.16. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK; PROVIDED THAT THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW. 67
(b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO. THE COMPANY, THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS EACH WAIVE PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY NEW YORK LAW. Section 10.17. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE COMPANY, THE BANKS AND THE AGENTS EACH WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR PARTIES, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE. THE COMPANY, THE BANKS AND THE AGENTS EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF OR THEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. Section 10.18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents and the Fee Letters, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the Company, the Banks and the Agents, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings of such Persons, verbal or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 68
