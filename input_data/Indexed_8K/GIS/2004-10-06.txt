     (ii) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives and the Selling Stockholder of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 6, an amendment or supplement that will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to the Underwriters in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request.

     (v) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with any review by it of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
     (vi) For a period of 60 days after the date of the Final Prospectus, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company of), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position as such terms are defined in Rule 16a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act in respect of, any shares of capital stock of the Company or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, other than (A) the Securities to be sold hereunder and the issuance of an equity-linked security and the transactions related thereto as described in the Final Prospectus, (B) any Stock issued by the Company upon exercise of any option or warrant or the conversion of any security outstanding on the date hereof, or (C) any Stock issued or options to purchase Stock issued pursuant to any existing employee (or non-employee director) benefit plans or dividend reinvestment plan.

     (viii) neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the offer and sale of the Securities, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated herein will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or its Material Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) the charter or by-laws of the Company or such subsidiaries, (ii) the terms of any material indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the Company or such subsidiaries is a party or bound or to which its or their property is subject, or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company or such subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company or such subsidiaries or any of its or their properties; and

     (ii) assuming that this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the Selling Stockholder and Diageo insofar as the laws of England are concerned, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the Selling Stockholder and Diageo;

     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware or the State of New York or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Selling Stockholder, Diageo and their respective subsidiaries and public officials.

     (e) The Selling Stockholder's and Diageo's outside English counsel, Slaughter and May, shall have furnished to the Representatives their opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, to the effect that:

     (ii) the signature and delivery of this Agreement by the Selling Stockholder and Diageo and the exercise of any rights and the performance of any obligations which it may have under this Agreement have been authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Selling Stockholder and Diageo; and
     (iii) the signature and delivery of this Agreement by the Selling Stockholder and Diageo and the exercise of any rights and the performance of any obligations which it may have under this Agreement:
     (A) are not prohibited by any law or regulation applicable to English companies generally or by the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Selling Stockholder or Diageo; and
     (B) do not require, under any law or regulation applicable to English companies generally, any approval, filing, registration or exemption.
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may make certain assumptions and reservations to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion.
     (f) The Representatives shall have received from Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the offer and sale of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

     (ii) to the best knowledge of such officers, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened; and
     (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change, or any development that would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse change, in the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations, prospects, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in
 
the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus.
     (h) The Selling Stockholder and Diageo shall each have furnished to the Representatives, with a copy to the Company, certificates of the Selling Stockholder and Diageo, respectively, signed by any senior executive officer, treasurer or director of the Selling Stockholder or Diageo, as the case may be, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the representations and warranties of the Selling Stockholder and Diageo in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of such date with the same effect as if made on such date and the Selling Stockholder and Diageo have each complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to such date.
     (i) The Company shall have requested and caused KPMG LLP to have furnished to the Representatives and the Selling Stockholder, at the Execution Date and the Closing Date, letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated as of such date and addressed to the Representatives and the Selling Stockholder, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and that they have performed a review of the unaudited interim financial information of the Company for the period ended on and as at the date of the unaudited financial statements of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, and stating in effect that:
     (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
     (ii) on the basis of a reading of the unaudited financial statements of the Company made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; their limited review, in accordance with standards established under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, of the unaudited interim financial information for the period ended on and as at the date of the unaudited financial statements of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, as indicated in their report which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and committees of the Company and the subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent unaudited financial statements of the Company, included or incorporated by
 
reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
     (1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or in reports on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act; or that said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus;
     (2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any capsule information), audited or unaudited, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than three Business Days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or capital stock of the Company or decreases in the stockholders' equity of the Company or in consolidated net current assets as compared with the amounts shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of the date indicated above included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date one day after the date above to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year for sales, earnings before taxes and earnings from joint ventures or in total or per share amounts of net earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
     (3) the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item 302 (Supplementary Financial Information), Item 402 (Executive Compensation) and Item 503(d) (Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K; and
     (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or
 
statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions "Summary", "Risk Factors", "Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges" in the Final Prospectus, the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 2, 6, 7 and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated by reference in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or reports on Form 8-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
             References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (i) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
     (j) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (i) of this Section 7 or (ii) any change, or any development that would reasonably be expected to result in any change, in or affecting the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations, prospects, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, after consultation with the Selling Stockholder, so material and adverse as to make it impractical to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus.
     (k) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, except for any decrease of one level in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities, or notice thereof, by either Standard & Poor's or Fitch, Inc.
     (l) The Securities to be delivered on the Closing Date shall have been approved for listing, subject to official notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange.
     (m) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Selling Stockholder shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
             If any of the conditions specified in this Section 7 shall not have been fulfilled in
 
all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions, letters and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company and the Selling Stockholder in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
             The documents required to be delivered by this Section 7 shall be delivered at the office of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, at 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017 on the Closing Date.
             8. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated (a) because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 7 hereof is not satisfied or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, or (b) because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Selling Stockholder to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof, the Company, in the case of clause (a), or the Selling Stockholder, in the case of clause (b), will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of such Securities; provided, however, that this Section 8 shall not apply in the event of termination of this Agreement and the obligations of the Underwriters hereunder by the Representatives for failure of the condition set forth in paragraph (j) of Section 7.
             9. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, Diageo and the Selling Stockholder, each of their respective officers and directors and each person who controls any Underwriter, Diageo or the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, or actions or proceedings (whether commenced or threatened) in respect thereof and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) (collectively, "") to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such Claims (including any amounts paid in settlement effected with the consent of the Company as provided herein), or actions or proceedings in respect thereof, arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claims; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that (i) any such Claims arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, or Prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on
Claims
 
behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives or by or on behalf of Diageo or the Selling Stockholder expressly for use therein, (ii) any such Claims arise out of or are based upon Diageo's or the Selling Stockholder's or any Underwriter's failure to furnish the Company, upon request, with the information with respect to Diageo or the Selling Stockholder, or any Underwriter or representative thereof, or with respect to the Selling Stockholder's intended method of distribution, that in any such case is the subject of the untrue statement or omission or (iii) the Company shall sustain the burden of proving that the Selling Stockholder or such Underwriter sold securities to the Person alleging such Claims without sending or giving, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the applicable Prospectus (excluding any documents incorporated by reference therein) or of the applicable Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented (excluding any documents incorporated by reference therein), if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to the Selling Stockholder or such Underwriter, and such Prospectus corrected such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, Diageo and the Selling Stockholder, each of their respective officers and directors and each person who controls the Company, Diageo or the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity in paragraph (a) above from the Company to each Underwriter, Diageo and the Selling Stockholder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity in paragraph (a) above. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. Each of the Company and the Selling Stockholder acknowledges that the statements set forth in the fourth paragraph and the second sentence of the ninth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
     (c) Diageo and the Selling Stockholder agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and the Company, and of their respective officers and directors and each person who controls any Underwriter or the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity in paragraph (a) above from the Company to each Underwriter, Diageo and the Selling Stockholder, but only with reference to written information relating to Diageo or the Selling Stockholder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of Diageo or the Selling Stockholder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity in paragraph (a) above. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which Diageo or the Selling Stockholder may otherwise have. Each Underwriter and the Company acknowledge that, for the purposes of this Agreement, the statements relating to the name, address and number of shares held by the Selling Stockholder set forth under the caption "Selling Stockholder" in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of Diageo or the Selling Stockholder for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
 
     (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above unless the indemnifying party was materially prejudiced by such failure of the indemnified party to give such notice and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) representation of both parties by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, (iv) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (v) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the action or proceeding within 20 days after receiving notice from the indemnified party that the indemnified party believes it has failed to do so, the indemnified party shall have the right to assume or continue its own defense and the indemnifying party shall be liable for any expenses therefor. If the indemnifying party is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim, it will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for each indemnified party with respect to such claim. The indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, does not subject the indemnified party to any material injunctive relief or other material equitable remedy and does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
 
     (e) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder, after taking into account the amount of damages such Underwriter is otherwise required to pay, if any. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. If, however, the allocation in the second preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, each indemnifying party severally shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative faults, but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The Company, Diageo, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Claims referred to above shall be deemed to include (subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (d) of this Section 9) any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. For purposes of this Section 9, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, each person who controls Diageo and the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of Diageo and the Selling Stockholder shall have the same rights to contribution as Diageo and the Selling Stockholder and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e).

             10. Default by an Underwriter. If on the Closing Date any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining
 
Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the number of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate number of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the number of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate number of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, the Selling Stockholder and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
             11. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company and the Selling Stockholder, if both (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading in the Company's Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) there shall have occurred any material disruption in securities clearance or settlement services, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis that, in your reasonable judgment, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events described in clauses (a)(i) through (iv), such event singly or together with any other such event makes it, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, after consultation with the Selling Stockholder, impractical to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus.
             12. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company, the Selling Stockholder, Diageo, the Representatives and the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Representative, Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder, Diageo or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 8 and 9 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
