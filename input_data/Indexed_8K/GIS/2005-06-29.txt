        MINNEAPOLIS, MINN.  General Mills (NYSE: GIS) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full 2005 fiscal year. In 2005, the fourth quarter and full year contained the usual 13 and 52 weeks, respectively. Last year, General Mills' fourth quarter and annual results each included an extra week.
Fiscal 2005 Financial Highlights
For the fiscal year ended May 29, 2005, General Mills' net sales grew 2 percent to $11.24 billion. Earnings after tax grew 18 percent to reach $1,240 million. This included a gain of $284 million after tax from businesses divested during 2005, partially offset by $87 million after-tax expense associated with the redemption of $760 million principal amount of General Mills' notes due in 2012. Diluted earnings per share grew to $3.08, up 18 percent from $2.60 in fiscal 2004. These earnings per share results reflect the company's adoption of accounting standard EITF 04-8 pertaining to contingently convertible debt, which reduced reported earnings per share in both years.
        Net results for both years also include certain identified costs (described in detail below) which primarily relate to restructuring actions taken subsequent to the company's fiscal 2002 acquisition of Pillsbury, and other merger-related costs. These expenses totaled $65 million after tax in 2005 and $39 million after tax in 2004. Excluding these identified costs, the impact of the adoption of EITF 04-8, and the net gain from divestitures and debt repurchase expense, diluted earnings per share in 2005 would have totaled $2.92 compared to $2.85 in 2004.
        Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Sanger said 2005 was a successful year for the company. "On a comparable 52-week basis, our net sales grew 3 percent, outpacing 2 percent growth in unit volume. Operating profit results in total reflected the significant input cost inflation we experienced in 2005; however, the Bakeries and Foodservice division met its goal of matching last year's profits and our International division posted strong profit growth. In addition, after-tax earnings from joint ventures grew 20 percent to reach $89 million. And the strong cash flows that we generated enabled us to pay increased shareholder dividends and invest $430 million in capital to support future growth, while we paid down $2 billion of our debt balance."
Fourth Quarter Results
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2005 totaled $2.72 billion, 3 percent below prior-year results that included the extra week. Earnings after tax totaled $460 million, up 65 percent. This included the gain recorded from dispositions of the company's 40.5 percent interest in Snack Ventures Europe and the Lloyd's barbeque entrees business, as well as the debt repurchase expenses described above. Fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share totaled $1.14 compared to 68 cents a year earlier.
        Identified items expenses totaled $25 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $8 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2004. Excluding these identified costs, the accounting rule change, and the net gain from business dispositions and debt repurchases, fourth quarter diluted earnings per share would have totaled 64 cents in 2005 and 74 cents in 2004.
Accounting Standard EITF 04-8
During 2005, General Mills adopted EITF 04-8, which requires contingently convertible debt to be treated as if it had already been converted to common shares when calculating EPS. For General Mills, this results in the addition of 29 million shares to the total diluted shares outstanding until the contingently convertible debentures issued in October 2002 are redeemed. General Mills has restated diluted shares outstanding and diluted EPS beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2003.
Identified Items Expense
General Mills recorded certain costs in 2005 and 2004. These costs include: the restructuring and other exit costs segregated on the consolidated statement of earnings; associated costs (primarily accelerated depreciation) included in cost of sales; and merger-related costs included in selling, general and administrative expense. We have separately identified these costs because they represent expenses associated with infrequently occurring events, and we believe identifying them improves the comparability of year-to-year results of operations.
        We also have separately discussed the gain from divestitures, the debt repurchase expenses and the effect of the accounting rule change because we believe doing so improves the comparability of year-to-year results of operations.
        A reconciliation of earnings and EPS with and without these factors appears in the table below. Earnings and EPS excluding these items are measures of performance that are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, net earnings and diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis. Please refer to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes for additional information regarding these items, and for presentation of results in accordance with GAAP.
U.S. Retail Segment Results
Net sales for General Mills' U.S. Retail operations totaled $7.78 billion in 2005, essentially matching last year's 53-week sales results. Unit volume grew 1 percent, with five of the company's six major product divisions recording gains. Segment operating profits totaled $1.72 billion, 5 percent below prior-year results as volume growth and productivity savings did not offset the impact of unfavorable sales mix, higher promotional expense and higher input costs.
        Yoplait yogurt volume grew 11 percent in 2005, led by Yoplait Light and other six-ounce cup varieties. Unit volume increases for Nature Valley snack bars and Pop Secret microwave popcorn fueled 2 percent overall volume growth for Snacks. Pillsbury USA, Baking Products and the Meals Division each posted unit volume gains of 1 percent. Big G cereal shipments declined 5 percent, as pricing and promotional shifts underway in the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal category impacted merchandised volume levels in the second half of the year. Excluding the extra week from prior-year results, total U.S. Retail unit volume would have increased 3 percent in 2005. Consumer purchases of the company's products grew essentially in line with shipments.
        Fourth quarter net sales for U.S. Retail totaled $1.81 billion and operating profits totaled $377 million. Both figures represent declines from 2004 results that included 14 weeks. Similarly, unit volume was down 4 percent. However, excluding the extra week in 2004, fourth-quarter unit volume represented a 3 percent increase. Consumer purchases of the company's products outpaced unit volume growth in the final quarter, as composite retail sales grew 4 percent.
Bakeries & Foodservice Segment Results
Bakeries & Foodservice net sales totaled $1.74 billion in 2005 compared to $1.76 billion in 2004. Operating profits totaled $134 million, essentially matching prior-year results. Unit volume declined 5 percent overall. While shipments to convenience store and vending customers rose 17 percent, that strong growth was more than offset by volume declines with foodservice distributors, restaurants and bakery accounts. Excluding last year's extra week, total Bakeries and Foodservice unit volume would have been down 3 percent in 2005.
        For the fourth quarter, net sales totaled $450 million and operating profits totaled $40 million. Unit volume was 7 percent below last year's fourth-quarter results. On a comparable 13-week basis, however, unit volume was up 1 percent for the period.
International Segment Results
International net sales grew 11 percent in 2005 to reach $1.72 billion. Unit volume increased 5 percent, and favorable currency exchange contributed 6 points of the net sales increase. Operating profits grew to $171 million compared to $119 million in 2004, fueled by volume growth, favorable currency and productivity gains. All four geographic regions  Canada, Europe, Latin America and Asia/Pacific  posted unit volume gains for the year. On a comparable 52-week basis, International unit volume grew 6 percent in 2005.
        Fourth-quarter International net sales totaled $456 million and operating profits were $54 million. Fourth quarter unit volume was up 3 percent. On a comparable 13-week basis, unit volume was up 5 percent for the period.
Joint Venture Summary
Earnings after tax from joint ventures totaled $89 million in 2005, up 20 percent from $74 million in 2004. The 2005 results include just nine months of contribution from Snack Ventures Europe, as General Mills' 40.5 percent share of this joint venture was redeemed for $750 million in February 2005.
        Cereal Partners Worldwide, the company's joint venture with Nestle, continued to generate good growth. General Mills' proportionate share of CPW net sales increased to $666 million in 2005 and unit volume grew 4 percent. The company's Haagen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia posted 3 percent volume growth for the year. 8Continent, the company's U.S. joint venture with Dupont, achieved strong double-digit volume growth and increased its dollar share of the refrigerated soymilk category to 16 percent.
th
        Fourth quarter earnings after tax from joint ventures declined to $16 million, reflecting the absence of contributions from Snack Ventures Europe in this year's final period.
Corporate Items
General Mills' total debt as of May 29, 2005, was $6,192 million, down $2,034 million from the end of fiscal 2004. Net interest expense in 2005 totaled $455 million, down 10 percent from the prior year due to the lower debt level, favorable rates, and $12 million of interest income recorded in the third quarter from the resolution of certain tax issues. The effective tax rate was 34.1 percent in the fourth quarter and 36.6 percent for the fiscal year, including the impact of taxes on the gain from business dispositions. Average diluted shares outstanding for the year decreased 1 percent to 409 million. For the fourth quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 407 million, 2 percent below the year-ago period.
Dividend Increased to $1.32 Annualized Rate
As previously announced on June 27, 2005, the General Mills Board of Directors declared a 6 percent increase in the quarterly dividend payable August 1, 2005, to shareholders of record July 11, 2005. The new annualized rate is $1.32 per share. General Mills and its predecessor firm have paid dividends without interruption or reduction for 106 years.
Outlook
Sanger said that 2005 marked the end of a transitional period for General Mills that followed the $10 billion acquisition of Pillsbury in fiscal 2002. Earnings results during that transition period included significant restructuring charges and costs related to the merger, which General Mills separately identified in its earnings guidance and reported results. EPS results for the company also reflected the fact that General Mills suspended open-market share repurchase activity in recent years to focus on debt reduction.
        Beginning in fiscal 2006, General Mills will no longer forecast identified expenses separately in its earnings guidance. The company intends to renew share repurchase activity in 2006, and expects share repurchases to be a source of EPS growth in 2006 and beyond.
        "We think General Mills is well-positioned to deliver low single-digit growth in net sales, mid single-digit growth in operating profits, and high single-digit growth in earnings per share," Sanger said. "Over the next three to five years, our goal is to deliver good growth while improving our return on capital by an average of 50 basis points a year. We believe this financial performance, together with dividend yield, should result in consistent, double-digit returns to General Mills shareholders."
        For fiscal 2006, the company said it is targeting low single-digit growth in net sales, and mid single-digit growth in operating profits driven by margin recovery in the U.S. Retail segment. Guidance for diluted EPS is a decline of 8 to 10 percent from $3.08 in 2005, which included the large net gain from dispositions. 2005 diluted EPS excluding that net gain, the impact of EITF 04-8, and approximately 8 cents contributed by divested businesses would have totaled $2.67. From this adjusted base, the company said it expects diluted EPS growth of 7 to 8 percent in 2006.
