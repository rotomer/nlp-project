General Mills, Inc. (the "Company") has entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan with a broker to facilitate the purchase of shares of its common stock. Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to purchase its shares at times when it ordinarily would not be in the market because of self-imposed trading blackout periods, such as the time immediately preceding its quarterly earnings releases. The shares to be repurchased under this 10b5-1 plan would be part of the Company's previously disclosed share repurchase authorization. The Company may terminate the 10b5-1 plan and may enter into similar arrangements in the future. Depending on market conditions, the Company may also make purchases in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions from time to time outside its normal trading blackout periods.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
