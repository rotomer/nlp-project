Fiscal 2007 Performance Awards
 
On June 26, 2006, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of General Mills, Inc. (the "Company") approved fiscal 2007 corporate performance measures, and individual performance measures for the Company's chief executive officer, under the Company's Executive Incentive Plan (the "EIP"). The EIP provides Company executives with an annual opportunity to earn incentive awards of cash and restricted stock based on corporate, business unit and individual performance.
 
Awards under the EIP are determined by multiplying an executive's base salary by a base incentive rate (a percentage of salary that increases with the level of responsibility), his or her individual performance rating and the corporate performance rating. For executives in operating units, the corporate rating is weighed with a business unit rating.
 
The corporate performance rating for fiscal 2007 will be based equally on the following four financial performance measures: operating profit; earnings-per-share; net sales; and return-on-capital. The Committee may also consider the Company's relative organizational and cultural progress in determining the corporate performance rating.
 
Business unit ratings for fiscal 2007 will be based on financial performance measures, such as profit and revenue growth.
 
Individual performance ratings for fiscal 2007 will be based on achievement of specific objectives, such as financial and operating results, completion of major projects, the quality of business plans and strategies, and progress in organizational and management development and diversity.
