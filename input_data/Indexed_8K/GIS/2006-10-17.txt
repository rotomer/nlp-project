(b)
   
The Administrative Agent will, with reasonable promptness, notify the Company and the Banks of each determination of an Offshore Rate;

provided

(c)

Section 2.11.
Payments by the Company
. (a) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Company on account of principal, interest, fees and other amounts required hereunder shall be made without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim; shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Banks at the Administrative Agent's Payment Office, and shall be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute on such date to each Bank its Commitment Percentage (or other applicable share as expressly provided herein) of such principal, interest, fees or other amounts, in like funds as received. Any payment which is received by the Administrative Agent later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) shall be deemed to have been received on the immediately succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
(b)
   
Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be; subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of "Interest Period" herein.
 
22
(c)
   
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Company will not make such payment in full as and when required hereunder, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the Company shall not have made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Bank, together with interest thereon for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate as in effect for each such day.
Section 2.12.
Payments by the Banks to the Agent
. (a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank on the Closing Date or, with respect to each Borrowing after the Closing Date, prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of any proposed Borrowing, that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative Agent as and when required hereunder for the account of the Company the amount of that Bank's Commitment Percentage of the Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that each Bank has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds on the Borrowing date and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Bank shall not have made its full amount available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent in such circumstances has made available to the Company such amount, that Bank shall on the next Business Day following the date of such Borrowing make such amount available to the Administrative Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for and determined as of each day during such period. A notice given by the Administrative Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to amounts owing under this subsection 2.12(a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such amount is so made available, such payment to the Administrative Agent shall constitute such Bank's Loan on the date of Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent on the next Business Day following the date of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, the Company shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent's account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.
 
23
(b)
   
The failure of any Bank to make any Loan on any date of borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on the date of such borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of any borrowing.
Section 2.13.
Sharing of Payments, Etc
. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Bank shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its Commitment Percentage of payments on account of the Loans obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided, however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Bank, such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Bank's Commitment Percentage (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Bank's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Company agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 10.10) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased pursuant to this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Banks following any such purchases or repayments.

(a) Subject to subsection 3.01(g), any and all payments by the Company to each Bank or Agent under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Bank and Agent, such taxes (including income taxes or franchise taxes) as are imposed on or measured by each Bank's net income by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or Agent, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "
Taxes
").
(b)
   
In addition, the Company shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents (hereinafter referred to as "
Other Taxes
"). If any Bank becomes aware of the imposition of Other Taxes, it shall promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent thereof.
(c)
   
Subject to subsection 3.01(g), the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Bank and Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.01) paid by such Bank or Agent and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Bank or Agent makes written demand therefor.
(d)
   
If the Company shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Bank or Agent, then, subject to subsection 3.01(g):
(i)
    
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) such Bank or Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made;
(ii)
   
the Company shall make such deductions; and
(iii)
  
the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
26
(e)
   
Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Company of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Company shall furnish to the Administrative Agent evidence of payment satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(f)
    
Each Bank which is a foreign person (i.e., a person other than a United States person for United States Federal income tax purposes) agrees that:
(i)
   
it shall, no later than the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Bank which becomes a party hereto pursuant to Section 2.14 or 10.08 after the Closing Date, the date upon which the Bank becomes a party hereto) deliver to the Company through the Administrative Agent two accurate and complete signed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto ("
Form W-8ECI
"), or two accurate and complete signed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto ("
Form W-8BEN
"), as appropriate, in each case indicating that the Bank is on the date of delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of principal, interest and fees under this Agreement free from withholding of United States Federal income tax;
(ii)
   
if at any time the Bank makes any changes necessitating a new Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN, it shall with reasonable promptness deliver to the Company through the Administrative Agent in replacement for, or in addition to, the forms previously delivered by it hereunder, two accurate and complete signed originals of Form W-8ECI; or two accurate and complete signed originals of Form W-8BEN, as appropriate, in each case indicating that the Bank is on the date of delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of principal, interest and fees under this Agreement free from withholding of United States Federal income tax;
(iii)
  
it shall, before or promptly after the occurrence of any event (including the passing of time but excluding any event mentioned in (ii) above) requiring a change in or renewal of the most recent Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN previously delivered by such Bank, deliver to the Company through the Administrative Agent two accurate and complete original signed copies of Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN in replacement for the forms previously delivered by the Bank; and
(iv)
  
it shall, promptly upon the Company's or the Administrative Agent's reasonable request to that effect, deliver to the Company or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) such other forms or similar documentation as may be required from time to time by any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation in order to establish such Bank's tax status for withholding purposes.
(g)
   
The Company will not be required to pay any additional amounts in respect of United States Federal income tax pursuant to subsection 3.01(d) to any Bank for the account of any Lending Office of such Bank:
 
27
(i)
   
if the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Bank to comply with its obligations under subsection 3.01(f) in respect of such Lending Office;
(ii)
  
if such Bank shall have delivered to the Company a Form W-8ECI in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to subsection 3.01(f), and such Bank shall not at any time be entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of United States Federal income tax in respect of payments by the Company hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in United States law or regulations or in the official interpretation of such law or regulations by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form W-8ECI; or
(iii)
  
if the Bank shall have delivered to the Company a Form W-8BEN in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to subsection 3.01(f), and such Bank shall not at any time be entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of United States Federal income tax in respect of payments by the Company hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in United States law or regulations or any applicable tax treaty or regulations or in the official interpretation of any such law, treaty or regulations by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form W-8BEN.
(h)
   
If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to any Bank or Agent pursuant to subsection 3.01(b) or 3.01(d), then such Bank shall use its reasonable best efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office or to take other reasonable action so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the Company which may thereafter accrue if such change or action in the judgment of such Bank is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
Section 3.02.
Illegality
. (a) If any Bank shall reasonably determine, based upon the advice of its counsel, that the introduction of any Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or administration thereof, has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its Lending Office to make Offshore Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof by the Bank to the Company through the Administrative Agent, the obligation of that Bank to make Offshore Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Bank shall have notified the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.
 
28
(b)
   
If a Bank shall reasonably determine, based upon the advice of its counsel, that it is unlawful to maintain any Offshore Rate Loan, the Company shall prepay in full all Offshore Rate Loans of that Bank then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof if the Bank may lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans, together with any amounts required to be paid in connection therewith pursuant to Section 3.04.
(c)
   
If the Company is required to prepay any Offshore Rate Loan immediately as provided in subsection 3.02(b), then concurrently with such prepayment, the Company shall borrow from the affected Bank, in the amount of such repayment, a Base Rate Loan.
(d)
   
If the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Offshore Rate Loans has been suspended as provided in subsection 3.02(a), the Company may elect, by giving notice to the Bank through the Administrative Agent that all Loans which would otherwise be made by the Bank as Offshore Rate Loans shall be instead Base Rate Loans.
(e)
   
Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.02, the affected Bank shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to its Offshore Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of the Bank, be illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Bank.
Section 3.03.
Increased Costs and Reduction of Return
. (a) If on or after the date hereof any Bank shall determine that, due to and as a direct result of either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included in the calculation of the Offshore Rate) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining its Revolving Commitment hereunder or any Offshore Rate Loans, then the Company shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon demand therefor by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased costs.
(b)
   
If after the date hereof any Bank shall have determined that (i) the introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (including any determination by any such central bank or other Governmental Authority that for purposes of Capital Adequacy Regulations, the Revolving Commitments do
 
29
not constitute commitments with an original maturity of one year or less), or (iv) compliance by such Bank (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling such Bank, with any Capital Adequacy Regulation; affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank and (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Bank's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its Revolving Commitment, loans, credits or obligations under this Agreement, then, upon demand of such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall upon demand pay to such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increase.
(c)
   
If the Company is required to pay additional amounts to any Bank pursuant to subsection 3.03(a) or (b), then such Bank shall use its reasonable best efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office with respect to its Offshore Rate Loans so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the Company which may thereafter accrue if such change in the judgment of such Bank is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.
Section 3.04.
Funding Losses
. The Company agrees to reimburse each Bank and to hold each Bank harmless from any loss or out-of-pocket expense which such Bank may sustain or incur as a direct consequence of:
(a)
   
the failure of the Company to make on a timely basis any payment of principal of any Offshore Rate Loan (including payments made after any acceleration thereof);
(b)
   
the failure of the Company to borrow, continue or convert a Loan after the Company has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation;
(c)
   
the failure of the Company to make any prepayment after the Company has given a notice in accordance with Section 2.06;
(d)
   
any principal payment in respect of an Offshore Rate Loan on a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto; or
(e)
   
the conversion pursuant to Section 2.04 of any Offshore Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the respective Interest Period;
including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain its Offshore Rate Loans hereunder or from standard fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Solely for purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company to the Banks under this Section 3.04, each Offshore Rate Loan made by a Bank (and
 
30
each related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the Offshore Base Rate used in determining the Offshore Rate for such Offshore Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Offshore Rate Loan is in fact so funded.
Section 3.05.
Inability to Determine Rates
. If the Administrative Agent shall have determined (i) that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Offshore Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Offshore Rate Loan or (ii) that the Offshore Rate applicable pursuant to subsection 2.08(a) for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Offshore Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Bank of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will forthwith give notice of such determination to the Company and each Bank. Thereafter, the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Offshore Rate Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If the Company does not revoke such notice, the Banks shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by the Company, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the Company, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of Offshore Rate Loans.
Section 3.06.
Certificates of Banks
. Any Bank claiming reimbursement or compensation pursuant to this Article 3 shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the computation of the amount payable to the Bank hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on the Company in the absence of manifest error.
Section 3.07.
Substitution of Banks
. Upon (x) the receipt by the Company from any Bank of a notice of illegality with respect to Offshore Rate Loans pursuant to Section 3.02, (y) the receipt by the Company from any Bank of a claim for additional amounts or compensation pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.03, or (z) the failure of a Bank to make any Loan on any date of Borrowing in violation of the terms of this Agreement, the Company may: (i) request one or more of the other Banks to acquire and assume all or part of such Bank's Loans and Revolving Commitment (but no other Bank shall be required to do so); or (ii) designate a replacement bank meeting the qualifications of an Eligible Assignee. Any such transfer under clause (i) or (ii) shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.04 and 10.08 hereof.
Section 3.08.
Survival
. The agreements and obligations of the Company in this Article 3 shall survive the payment of all other Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.01, each Bank that has executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with each document or other matter either sent by the Administrative Agent to such Bank for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Bank.
Section 9.05.
Notice of Default
. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Bank or the Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be requested by the Majority Banks in accordance with Article 8;
provided, however
, that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received any such request, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Banks.
Section 9.06.
Credit Decision
. Each Bank expressly acknowledges that none of the Administrative Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated thereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and extend credit to the Company hereunder. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects,
 
51
operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Company which may come into the possession of any of the Administrative Agent-Related Persons.
Section 9.07.
Indemnification
. The Banks shall indemnify upon demand the Administrative Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Company and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments, or if no Revolving Commitments are in effect, in accordance with their respective outstanding Loans, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following the repayment of the Loans and the termination or resignation of the Administrative Agent) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any document contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by any such Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided, however
, that no Bank shall be liable for the payment to the Administrative Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Bank (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Bank failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Bank shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses and attorneys' fees (including Attorney Costs). The obligation of the Banks in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder.
 
52
Section 9.08.
Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity
. Citibank, N.A. and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though Citibank, N.A. were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Banks. The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Citibank, N.A. or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Company or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Company or such Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, Citibank, N.A. shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall include Citibank, N.A. in its individual capacity.
Section 9.09.
Successor Administrative Agent
. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the Company shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks (unless an Event of Default then exists in which case the Majority Banks shall appoint the successor agent). If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Banks and the Company, a successor agent from among the Banks. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article 9 and Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Company or the Majority Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for above.
Section 9.10.
Other Agents
. None of the Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agents shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Banks as such. Each Bank acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on the Syndication Agent in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

Indemnity
. (a) The Company shall pay, indemnify, and hold each Bank and Agent and each of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (each, an "Indemnified Person") harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses or disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement and any other Loan Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and with respect to any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) related to this Agreement or the Loans or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities");
provided
, that the Company shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment. The agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all other Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
(b)
   
An Indemnified Person shall give prompt notice to the Company of any claim asserted in writing, or the commencement of any action or proceeding, in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, provided that the omission so to notify the Company will not relieve the Company from any liability, if any, which it may have to the Indemnified Person otherwise than under Section 10.05(a) unless and to the extent that the Company shall have been damaged by the delay in notification or the failure to be notified.
(c)
   
The Indemnified Person shall assist the Company in the defense of any such action or proceeding by arranging discussions with (and the calling as witnesses of) relevant officers, directors, employees and agents of the Indemnified Person and providing reasonable access to relevant books and records. The Company shall have the right to, and shall at the request of the Indemnified Person, participate in, and assume the defense of, any such action or proceeding at its own expense using counsel mutually acceptable to the Company and the
 
56
Indemnified Person. In any such action or proceeding which the Company has participated in or assumed the defense of, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain separate counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at its own expense unless the named parties to any such suit, action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Company and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them it being understood and agreed that the Company shall not have liability for the fees and expenses of more than one firm (in addition to local counsel) which shall be retained to act in such circumstances for all of the Indemnified Parties
provided however
that the Company shall have the liability for the fees and expenses of more than one firm if such firm or firms has or have been retained due to actual or potential differing interests among the Indemnified Parties.

Section 10.06.
Marshalling; Payments Set Aside
. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Banks shall be under any obligation to marshall any assets in favor of the Company or any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or the Banks, or the Administrative Agent or the Banks exercise their rights of set-off, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Banks) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding, or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Bank severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its ratable share of the total amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent.
          
Section 10.07.

57
Section 10.08.
Assignments, Participations, Etc
.
(a)
   
Any Bank may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it);
provided
that
(i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Bank's Revolving Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund with respect to a Bank, the amount of the Revolving Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, as hereinafter defined, with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans and/or the Revolving Commitment assigned and (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto (an "
Assignment and Assumption Agreement
"), together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Bank, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.02(a), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, and the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement covering all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.03, 10.04, and 10.05). Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
(b)
   
Any Bank may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Company or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "
Participant
") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and/or the Loans at the time owing to it);
provided that
(i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the
 
58
Company, the Administrative Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (a), (b) or (c) of Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c) of this Section, the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 and 3.04 to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section.
(c)
   
A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.03 than the applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent. A Participant organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section 3.01(f) as though it were a Bank.
(d)
   
Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto.
(e)
   
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank (a "
Granting Bank
") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Company (an "
SPC
"), the option to provide to the Company all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to the Company pursuant to this Agreement;
provided that
(i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii) the Granting Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged and (iii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Revolving Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Bank). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement
 
59
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.08, any SPC may with notice to, but without (except as specified below) the prior written consent of, the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Bank or to any financial institution (consented to by the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred, the Company, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans. Any SPC shall be a Transferee for purposes of Section 10.09 hereof, provided that in addition to disclosures permitted pursuant to Section 10.09, an SPC may disclose on a basis acknowledged by the recipient as confidential any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. An amendment to this subsection (e) without the written consent of an SPC shall be ineffective insofar as it alters the rights and obligations of such SPC.
Section 10.09.
Confidentiality
. Each Bank agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care (in the same manner as it exercises for its own affairs) to maintain the confidentiality of all information identified as "confidential" by the Company and provided to it by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or by the Administrative Agent on such Company's or Subsidiary's behalf, in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such information for any purpose or in any manner other than pursuant to the terms contemplated by this Agreement; except to the extent such information
(i)
    
was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by such Bank, or
(ii)
   
was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company known to such Bank; provided further, however, that any Bank may disclose such information
(A)
  
at the request or pursuant to any requirement of any Governmental Authority to which such Bank or its Affiliates are subject or in connection with an examination of such Bank or its Affiliates by any such authority;
(B)
  
pursuant to subpoena or other court process, provided that the Company is given prompt notice of such subpoena or other process (unless such Bank is legally prohibited from giving such notice);
 
60
(C)
  
when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law;
(D)
  
to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which any Agent, any Bank or their respective Affiliates may be party;
(E)
  
to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document; and
(F)
   
to such Bank's independent auditors and other professional advisors as may be reasonably required in order for any party to fulfill its obligations, provided further, that such auditors or advisors shall be informed of the confidentiality requirements of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant or Assignee (each, a "
Transferee
") and to any prospective Transferee or to any actual or prospective contractual counterparty (or its advisors) to any securitization, hedge or other derivative transaction, such financial and other information in such Bank's possession concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries which has been delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Banks pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Banks by the Company in connection with the Bank's credit evaluation of the Company prior to entering into this Agreement; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the Company, such Person agrees in writing to such Bank to keep such information confidential to the same extent required of the Banks hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any party hereto (and any employee, representative or other agent of thereof) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. However, no disclosure of any information relating to such tax treatment or tax structure may be made to the extent nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.
Section 10.10.
Set-off
. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by law, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Bank is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Company, any such notice being waived by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any
 
61
time owing to, such Bank or any of its Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the Company against any and all Obligations owing to such Bank or Affiliate, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Bank shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Company and the Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Bank or Affiliate;
provided, however
, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Bank under this Section 10.10 are in addition to the other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) which the Bank may have.
Section 10.11.
Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc
. Each Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any changes in the address to which notices to the Bank should be directed, of addresses of its Offshore Lending Office, of payment instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it hereunder and of such other administrative information as the Agent shall reasonably request.
Section 10.12.
Counterparts
. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement in any number of separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute but one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Company and the Administrative Agent.
Section 10.13.
Severability
. The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

. This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Company, the Banks and the Agents, and their permitted successors and assigns, and no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any direct or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
