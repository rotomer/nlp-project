SCHEDULING
 
Lessee shall provide Operator with requests for flight time and proposed flight schedules as far in advance of any given flight as possible, and in any case, at least 24 hours prior to Lessee's planned departure. Requests for flight time shall be in a form, whether oral or written, mutually convenient to, and agreed to by the parties.

Operator may maintain such insurance coverage with respect to the Aircraft and any flights made under this Agreement as Operator may elect in its sole discretion, including aircraft physical damage coverage (hull insurance) and liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage. Operator shall retain all rights and benefits with respect to the proceeds payable under the hull insurance as a result of any incident or occurrence while an Aircraft is being operated on behalf of Lessee under this Agreement. Lessee shall be named as an additional insured on liability insurance policies maintained by Operator on the Aircraft with respect to flights conducted pursuant to this Agreement. Any hull insurance maintained by Operator on the Aircraft shall include a waiver of any rights of subrogation of the insurers against Lessee.
