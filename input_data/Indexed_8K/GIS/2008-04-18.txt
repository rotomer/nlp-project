This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished by General Mills, Inc. (the "Company") on April 14, 2008 (the "Original Form 8-K"). The Company is furnishing this Form 8-K/A to amend and replace Exhibit 100 to the Original Form 8-K. Due to a filing agent error, the Original Form 8-K contained an incorrect version of Exhibit 100, which should not be used or relied upon for any purpose.
Attached as Exhibit 100 to this Current Report are the following financial statements from the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended February 24, 2008, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 20, 2008, formatted in XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language): (i) the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the quarter and nine-month periods ended February 24, 2008 and February 25, 2007; (ii) the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 24, 2008 and May 27, 2007; (iii) the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income for the nine-month period ended February 24, 2008 and the fiscal year ended May 27, 2007; and (iv) the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine-month periods ended February 24, 2008 and February 25, 2007. Users of this data are advised pursuant to Rule 401 of Regulation S-T that the financial and other information contained in the XBRL documents is unaudited and that these are not the official publicly filed financial statements of the Company. The purpose of submitting these XBRL formatted documents is to test the related format and technology and, as a result, investors should continue to rely on the official filed version of the furnished documents and not rely on the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A, including Exhibit 100, in making investment decisions.
In accordance with Rule 402 of Regulation S-T, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A, including Exhibit 100, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
