MINNEAPOLIS, MINN.General Mills (NYSE: GIS) said today that strong fourth-quarter sales will lead fiscal 2008 results to exceed targeted levels. In the final quarter ended May 25, 2008, net sales grew 13 percent. As a result, fiscal 2008 sales are expected to increase 10 percent to $13.7 billion. Segment operating profits are expected to grow at a mid single-digit rate for the full year, despite higher input costs and a double-digit increase in consumer marketing expense. General Mills now expects fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share (EPS) to be approximately $3.71. This includes an estimated 19 cents per share of non-cash net gains from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and a favorable ruling related to a tax contingency. Excluding these non-cash gains, earnings per share would be approximately $3.52, up 11 percent from reported earnings of $3.18 per share a year ago.
The company had been targeting earnings excluding these non-cash items of $3.45 to $3.47 per share, and had estimated reported earnings of $3.75 to $3.77 per share.
Fourth-quarter diluted EPS are expected to be 53 cents. This includes an expected reduction of the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions from a net gain of $168 million at the end of the third quarter to a net gain of $57 million at the end of the fiscal year, primarily due to declines in key commodity market prices from the prevailing levels recognized last quarter. Excluding this $111 million pre-tax mark-to-market reduction, diluted EPS are expected to be 73 cents, up 18 percent from 62 cents per share reported for the fourth quarter a year ago.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2009, the company expects to generate continuing sales and earnings growth that meets or exceeds its long-term targets. Sales and segment operating profits are expected to grow at mid single-digit rates. Diluted earnings per share will continue to include mark-to-market valuation of commodity positions, but the company cannot predict its effect on earnings. Assuming no mark-to-market impact in fiscal 2009, earnings are expected to be between $3.78 and $3.83 per share for the year, representing growth of 7 to 9 percent from the $3.52 EPS excluding tax and commodity items in fiscal 2008.
Fiscal 2009 Outlook
General Mills plans to release fiscal 2008 results on June 25, 2008. A briefing will be held for investors on that day beginning at 9:00 a.m. EDT. You may access the web cast from General Mills' corporate home page: .

Earnings per share excluding certain non-cash items is a non-GAAP measure. Reconciliation of this measure to the relevant GAAP measure (earnings per share) appears in the table above.
