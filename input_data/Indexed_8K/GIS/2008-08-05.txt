The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
(b) If the Time of Sale Information is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Final Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event occurs as a result of which the Time of Sale Information would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if any event occurs or condition exists as a result of which the Time of Sale Information conflicts with the information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Information to comply with applicable law, the Company will forthwith prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Information so that the statements in the Time of Sale Information, as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Information, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Information, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
(c) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (or in lieu thereof the notice required by Rule 173), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to the underwriters in such quantities as the representatives may reasonably request.
(d) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
(e) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (or in lieu thereof the notice required by Rule 173), as many copies of the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering.
(f) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(g) The Company will furnish to the Underwriters a copy of each proposed Free Writing Prospectus to be prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Company and will not use or refer to any proposed Free Writing Prospectus to which the Underwriters reasonably object.
(h) The Company will not take any action that would result in an Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act a Free Writing Prospectus prepared by or on behalf of any Underwriter that the Underwriter otherwise would not have been required to file thereunder.
(i) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, (i) offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or (ii) establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Rule 16a of the Exchange Act in respect of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company with a maturity in excess of one year or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Closing Date.
(j) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
(k) In connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person; (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company and are not obligated to disclose such interests.
(l) If the third anniversary of December 1, 2005 occurs before all the Securities have been sold by the Underwriters, prior to such third anniversary the Company will file a new shelf registration statement and take any other action necessary to permit the public offering of the Securities to continue without interruption; references herein to the Registration Statement shall include the new registration statement declared effective by the Commission.
(m) The Company will prepare a final term sheet relating to the offering of the Securities, substantially in the form of Exhibit A to Schedule III, containing only information that describes the final terms of the Securities or the offering in a form consented to by the Representatives, and will file such final term sheet within the period required by Rule 433(d)(5)(ii) under the Act following the date the final terms have been established for the offering of the Securities.
(n) The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a Free Writing Prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433(h)(1), and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Securities or their offering, (ii) information that is permitted by Rule 134 of the Act or (iii) information that describes the final terms of the Securities or their offering and that is included in the final term sheet of the Company contemplated in Section 5(m); provided that each Underwriter severally covenants with the Company not to take any action without the Company's prior consent that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) under the Act a Free Writing Prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.

(d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President or any Vice President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have reviewed the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Final Prospectus, any supplements to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;

(e) The Company shall have requested and caused KPMG LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, constituting statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters and (i) confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder; (ii) confirming that they have performed a review of the unaudited interim financial information of the Company for the period ended on and as at the date of the unaudited financial statements of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and Final Prospectus, in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100; and (iii) stating in effect, except as provided in Schedule I hereto, that:
(i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
(ii) on the basis of a reading of the unaudited financial statements of the Company made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; their limited review, in accordance with standards established under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, of the unaudited interim financial information for the period ended on and as at the date of the unaudited financial statements of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and Final Prospectus, as indicated in their report which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and committees of the Company and its subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent unaudited financial statements of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:
(1) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or in reports on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus;
(2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements (other than any capsule information), audited or unaudited, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus, there were any changes, at a specified date not more than three Business Days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or capital stock of the Company or decreases in the stockholders' equity of the Company or in consolidated net current assets as compared with the amounts shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of the date indicated above included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from the date one day after the date above to such specified date there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year for sales, earnings before taxes and earnings from joint ventures or in total or per share amounts of net earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; and
(3) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited financial statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Final Prospectus for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles; and
(4) the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item 302 (Supplementary Financial Information), Item 402 (Executive Compensation) and Item 503(d) (Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K; and
(iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions "Summary", "Risk Factors", "Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges" in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus, and the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 1, 1A, 2, 6, 7 and 11 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
(f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations, prospects, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus, the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus.
(g)  Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
(h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, at 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 on the Closing Date.
7.  If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.
8.  (a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the officers and directors of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h)(1) under the Act, any issuer information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d)(i)(B) under the Act or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the paragraph related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder, after taking into account the amount of damages such Underwriter is otherwise required to pay, if any. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director and officer of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director and officer of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

9.  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

(b) the representation in Section 1(b)(iii) is incorrect in any respect.
11.  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

If the date of Maturity of a Note is not a Business Day, the payment due on such day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall accrue for the period from Maturity to that next succeeding Business Day.
(5) Each Note will bear interest from and including August 5, 2008 or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) as to which interest on such Note (or any Predecessor Security with respect to such Note) has been paid or made available for payment at an annual rate of 5.250% until the principal of the Note is paid or made available for payment. Each payment of interest on a Note will include interest to, but excluding, as the case may be, the relevant Interest Payment Date or Maturity.
The "Interest Payment Dates" for the Notes will be February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on February 15, 2009 and the Regular Record Dates will be the February 1 or August 1, respectively, next preceding such Interest Payment Date whether or not a Business Day. If any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, the payment due on such day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall accrue for the period from such Interest Payment Date to that next succeeding Business Day.
Interest (including interest for partial periods) will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
(6) Payment of principal of and premium (if any) and interest on each Note that is represented by a Global Security will be made to the Depositary (as specified in paragraph 16 below) or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole Holder of the Notes represented thereby for all purposes under the Indenture.
Payment of principal of and premium (if any) and interest on each Note that is not represented by a Global Security will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Note at the office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (which shall initially be the office of the Trustee). Registered Holders that wish to receive payment in immediately available funds must provide appropriate written wire transfer instructions sufficiently in advance of the payment date and present the Note in time for the party making the payment to make payments in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures. Any wire transfer instructions received by a party making payments shall remain in effect until revoked by the registered Holder. Payment in accordance with written wire transfer instructions from a registered Holder shall be deemed to constitute full and complete payment of all amounts so paid. The Company may, at its option, elect to make payments of interest other than at Maturity by check mailed to the address of the registered Holder thereof as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date as such address appears in the Security Register.
The "Place of Payment" with respect to the Notes shall be The City of New York.
(7) The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at its option at any time or from time to time at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed on the Redemption Date and (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes being redeemed on the Redemption Date (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months or in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days elapsed) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 30 basis points, plus, in the case of both (i) and (ii) above, accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to but excluding the Redemption Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Redemption Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holders as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date. Notice of redemption will be given to the registered Holders of the Notes to be redeemed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, which date and the applicable Redemption Price will be specified in the notice. Once notice of redemption is mailed, the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption will become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the applicable Redemption Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. On and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest). On or before the Redemption Date, the Company will deposit with a Paying Agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Notes or any portion of the Notes to be redeemed on that date. For purposes of the foregoing: (a) "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (as defined below), calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price (as defined below) for such Redemption Date; the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date; (b) "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Notes; (c) "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations (as defined below) for such Redemption Date; (d) "Quotation Agent" means the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below) appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company; (e) "Reference Treasury Dealer" means any primary U.S. government securities dealer in the United States selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company; (f) "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. in The City of New York on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
(8) If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A) shall have occurred, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Notes in the manner provided and subject to the limitations set forth in the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A.
(9) The Notes shall be issuable in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
(15) The Notes shall be defeasible, in whole or any specified part, pursuant to Section 1302 or Section 1303 of the Indenture or both such Sections.
(16) The Notes shall be issuable in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee. The Depositary with respect to such Global Securities shall be The Depository Trust Company. The Global Securities shall bear the legends set forth on the form of Note attached hereto as Exhibit A. Such Global Security may not be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of such Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name or names of Persons other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof, unless (a) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and, in either case, the Company does not appoint a successor Depositary within 90 days after receiving that notice or becoming aware that the Depositary is no longer so registered, (b) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable or (z) an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security has occurred and is continuing, and the Depositary requests the issuance of Securities registered in the name or names of Persons other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof. So long as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered holder of any Global Security, the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole Holder of the Notes represented by such Global Security for all purposes under the Notes and the Indenture.

Exhibit 5.1

General Mills, Inc. Number One General Mills Boulevard Minneapolis, Minnesota 55426
Re: Registration Statements on Form S-3
Nos. 333-116779 and 333-75808
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Vice President, Deputy General Counsel of General Mills, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and I and those under my supervision have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the Registration Statements on Form S-3 (Nos. 333-116779 and 333-75808) (collectively, the "Registration Statements") and a Prospectus Supplement dated July 31, 2008 to the Prospectus dated September 20, 2004 (collectively, the "Prospectus Supplement") relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the Registration Statements of $700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.250% Notes due 2013 (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of February 1, 1996 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (formerly known as First Trust of Illinois, National Association), as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated July 31, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co.
I or those under my supervision have examined such documents and have reviewed such questions of law as I have deemed necessary and appropriate for the purposes of furnishing this opinion.
In rendering my opinion, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. I have also assumed the legal capacity for all purposes relevant hereto of all natural persons and, with respect to all parties to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company, that such parties had the requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise), executed and delivered by such parties and that such agreements or instruments are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such parties. I have relied as to matters of fact (but not to legal conclusion), to the extent I deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.
Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in the manner specified in the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
The opinions set forth above are subject to the following qualifications and exceptions:
(a) My opinions are subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar law of general application affecting creditors' rights.
(b) My opinions are subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including (without limitation) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and other similar doctrines affecting the enforceability of agreements generally (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
(c) I express no opinion as to the enforceability of (i) provisions that relate to choice of law, (ii) waivers by the Company of any statutory or constitutional rights or remedies or (iii) terms which excuse any person or entity from liability for, or require the Company to indemnify such person or entity against, such person's or entity's negligence or willful misconduct.
(d) I draw your attention to the fact that, under certain circumstances, the enforceability of terms to the effect that provisions may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited.
My opinions expressed above are limited to the federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the Delaware General Corporation Law.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statements and to the reference to myself under the caption "Validity of the Notes" in the Prospectus Supplement.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Janice L. Marturano
