Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On March 9, 2009, General Mills, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an agreement to sell a portion of the assets of the frozen unbaked bread dough product line for its Bakeries and Foodservice segment. The Company expects the transaction to close during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and expects to record a loss of approximately $19 million after taxes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in connection with the sale, primarily the result of the write-off of associated goodwill. Certain assets being sold are shared with a frozen dinner roll product line for the Company's U.S. Retail segment. As a result of the sale, the Company will exit this product line. The Company expects to record an after-tax charge of approximately $13 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 related to the termination of this product line, consisting of a $20 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge against long-lived assets and approximately $1 million pre-tax of other costs associated with the exit of the product line, primarily employee severance. The Company will present this transaction as a Divestiture in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
