Item 8.01 Other Events.
General Mills, Inc. markets its Yoplait yogurt in the United States according to the terms of a Manufacturing and Distribution License Agreement (the "Agreement") with Sodima, a French dairy company. Over the past several months, Sodima has expressed to General Mills its desire to renegotiate the terms of the Agreement. On September 3, 2010, General Mills received a letter from Sodima purporting to terminate the Agreement effective two years from now, on September 9, 2012. The terms of the Agreement do not provide for either renegotiation or termination in these circumstances. As such, we believe that the Agreement remains in full force and effect. On September 7, 2010, General Mills filed a petition for arbitration, as provided for by the dispute resolution provisions of the Agreement, to preserve and enforce its rights under the Agreement and to confirm that Sodima is not entitled to terminate the Agreement. Our discussions with Sodima are ongoing, and we remain hopeful that the partie s will reach a resolution. General Mills has licensed the Yoplait trademark under the Agreement for more than 30 years. During that time, General Mills has invested considerable effort, resources and capital to successfully build the Yoplait brand and its yogurt business in the United States. We intend to continue to use the Yoplait trademark under the terms of our Agreement, and we will vigorously defend and enforce our exclusive rights to use the Yoplait mark in the United States.
