Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
At the beginning of fiscal 2011, we revised the classification of certain revenues and expenses. We have revised the classification of our previously reported Consolidated Statements of Earnings to conform to the current year presentation. These revised classifications had no effect on previously reported net earnings attributable to General Mills or earnings per share. The changes include:  Revising the classification of certain customer logistics allowances as a reduction of net sales (previously recorded as cost of sales).  Revising the classification of certain promotion-related costs, customer allowances, and supply chain costs as cost of sales or selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (previously recorded as a reduction of net sales or SG&A expenses).  Shifting allocation of certain SG&A expenses, primarily stock-based compensation, between segment operating profit and unallocated corporate items.  Shifting sales responsibilit y for a customer from our Bakeries and Foodservice segment to our U.S. Retail segment. Financial information for each of the four quarters and annually for fiscal 2010 and 2009, and annually for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, as reported and as reclassified, is available on the Companys website at www.generalmills.com in the "Investors" section.
