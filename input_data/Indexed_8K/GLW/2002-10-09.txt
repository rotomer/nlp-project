FOR RELEASE -- OCTOBER 9, 2002 Media Relations Contact: Investor Relations Contact: Daniel F. Collins Kenneth C. Sofio (607) 974-4197 (607) 974-7705 collinsdf@corning.com sofiokc@corning.com Corning Expects Third-Quarter Results to Meet Guidance CORNING, N.Y. -- Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) today said that for the third quarter ended September 30, 2002, it expects results to be within the range of its previously announced guidance. The company anticipates sales for the quarter will be between $830 million and $840 million, and that it will record a net loss in the range of $0.07 to $0.08 per share, excluding one-time items. Corning's third-quarter results will also include previously announced restructuring and impairment charges of approximately $125 million pretax and a $0.12 reduction in earnings per share as a result of the declaration of dividends on Corning's 7.00% Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock offering completed in the third quarter. Including these items, Corning expects to incur a net loss in the range of $0.27 to $0.28 per share for the quarter. James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said, "We are very pleased that our results appear to be coming in within the range that we provided investors in our July guidance. However, we are not satisfied with our loss position. We warned investors in July that our telecommunications business could see further weakness and that has occurred, evidenced by our third-quarter sales being at the lower end of our guidance range." "The telecommunications industry outlook remains difficult, driven by additional carrier capital expenditure reductions, lack of industry consolidation and bankruptcies. These events will require us to do more restructuring in the fourth quarter," Flaws said. "While our restructuring actions to date have helped our bottom line, we must further align our telecommunications business cost structure to the new realities of the markets in which we compete. These necessary steps in our telecommunications business, combined with the ongoing strength that we see in our advanced materials and information display segments, will help us achieve our goal of profitability in 2003."

Corning Expects Third-Quarter Results to Meet Guidance Page Two Previously, Corning said that further restructuring initiatives could include more headcount reductions, the potential sale or discontinuation of some non-core assets, plant closures and consolidation of manufacturing capacity within the telecommunications segment, and the centralization of administrative functions.
