Exhibit 99.1 FOR RELEASE -- FEBRUARY 5, 2004 Corning Contact: Daniel F. Collins (607) 974-4197 collinsdc@corning.com Eugene C. Sit Joins Corning Board of Directors CORNING, N.Y., -- Eugene C. Sit -- chairman, chief executive officer and chief investment officer of Sit Investment Associates, Inc. - has been appointed to the board of directors of Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW). The Corning Board Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee proposed him as a director candidate, and the full board approved his nomination at yesterday's board of directors meeting. He will stand for election for a three-year term at Corning's annual meeting of shareholders on April 29, 2004. Sit's appointment brings the number of Corning directors to 14. Corning's bylaws permit the number of directors to vary between nine and 24 members, and the size of the board has ranged from 13 to 18 directors since 1990. According to the company's corporate governance guidelines, the size of the board provides for sufficient diversity among non-employee directors while also enabling substantive discussions in which each director can participate meaningfully. Sit, 65, brings a broad perspective on global business and finance to the Corning board. He founded Sit Investment Associates (SIA), based in Minneapolis, in 1981. SIA, a diverse financial asset management firm with capabilities in both domestic and international financial asset management, has more than $6 billion of assets under management for institutional, family and mutual fund clients. He is the former chief executive officer and chief investment officer for IDS Advisory (now American Express Financial Advisors). During his tenure, assets under management expanded rapidly and the firm compiled one of the superior performance records in the investment management industry. A native of Canton, China (now known as Guangzhou), Sit was educated at DePaul University in Chicago, where he received his B.S.C. He is both a chartered financial analyst and a certified public accountant. Active in industry and community affairs, he currently serves as a trustee at Carleton College, The Minnesota Historical Society, and as a member of the Advisory Council of the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management - International Programs.
