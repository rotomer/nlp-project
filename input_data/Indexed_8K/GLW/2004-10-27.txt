Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosures The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 7.01, "Regulation FD Disclosure." On October 22, 2004, Corning Incorporated decided to offer a voluntary odd-lot program for eligible small shareholders, allowing shareholders owning fewer than 100 shares of Corning Common Stock to either sell all of their shares or to purchase additional shares to increase their holdings to 100 shares. The program will be in effect from October 29, 2004 through November 29, 2004 ("Program Period") unless extended or earlier terminated. The actual price per share eligible shareholders will receive or pay will be a market-based price per share that will be uniformly applied to all shareholders participation during the Program Period, and cannot be determined in advance. Informational letters will be sent to eligible shareholders on or about October 29, 2004 and questions should be directed to Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. at 1-888-288-7059. Corning is making no recommendation to shareholders as to whether to act upon this voluntary program.
