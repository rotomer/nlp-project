Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 7.01, "Regulation FD Disclosure." On November 29, 2004, Corning Incorporated decided extend the time for its voluntary odd-lot program for eligible small shareholders, allowing shareholders owning fewer than 100 shares of Corning Common Stock to either sell all of their shares or to purchase additional shares to increase their holdings to 100 shares. The program will continue to be in effect from November 30, 2004 through December 29, 2004 ("Program Extension Period") unless extended or earlier terminated. The actual price per share eligible shareholders will receive or pay will be a market-based price per share that will be uniformly applied to all shareholders participating during the Program Extension Period, and cannot be determined in advance. Informational letters about the Program Extension Period will be sent to eligible shareholders on or about November 30, 2004 and questions should be directed to Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. at 1-888-288-7059. Corning is making no recommendation to shareholders as to whether to act upon this voluntary program.
