Exhibit 99 ---------- FOR RELEASE -- APRIL 18, 2005 Media Relations Contact: Investor Relations Contact: Daniel F. Collins Kenneth C. Sofio (607) 974-4197 (607) 974-7705 collinsdf@corning.com sofiokc@corning.com Corning Expects First-Quarter Results to Exceed Guidance CORNING, N.Y. -- Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) today announced that it expects 2005 first-quarter sales to be in the range of $1.04 billion to $1.05 billion and earnings per share (EPS) to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.17, before special items. Corning's first quarter ended March 31, 2005. This EPS estimate is a non-GAAP financial measure. This and all non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled on the company's investor relations Web site and in an attachment to this news release. The first-quarter sales and EPS ranges exceed the company's previously announced guidance of sales between $980 million to $1.03 billion and EPS of $0.11 to $0.13, excluding special items. This is a non-GAAP financial measure. The company said that its improved expectations on first-quarter results are due to significantly stronger performance from Dow Corning Corporation and higher-than-expected demand for Corning's hardware and equipment products. In addition, the company expects that its first-quarter results will benefit from a lower-than-anticipated corporate tax rate. Corning also expects that the volume and pricing of optical fiber and liquid crystal display glass will be within previously stated guidance ranges for the first quarter. Corning plans to issue its first-quarter results after the New York Stock Exchange close of business on Tuesday, April 26.

Corning Expects First-Quarter Results to Exceed Guidance Page Two Presentation of Information in this News Release Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP EPS measure excludes the impact of gains or losses arising from restructuring or impairment actions and any further adjustments to the asbestos settlement reserve required by movement in Corning's stock price. The company believes presenting a non-GAAP EPS measure is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. This non-GAAP measure is reconciled on the company's website at www.corning.com/investor_relations and accompanies this news release.

CORNING INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE Three Months Ended March 31, 2005 (Unaudited; amounts in millions, except per share amounts) - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Corning's earnings per share (EPS) excluding special items for the first quarter of 2005 is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company believes presenting non-GAAP EPS is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. A detailed reconciliation is provided below outlining the differences between this non-GAAP measure and the directly related GAAP measure. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Range --------------------- Guidance: EPS excluding special items $ 0.16 $ 0.17 Special items: Restructuring, impairment and other (charges) and credits (a) (0.01) (0.01) Asbestos settlement (b) 0.01 0.01 ------ ------ Earnings per share 0.16 0.17 (a) In the first quarter of 2005, Corning recorded an impairment charge of $19 million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of its investment in Avanex Corporation (Avanex). At March 31, 2005, shares of Avanex were trading at $1.30 per share compared to Corning's average cost basis of $2.40 per share. Corning does not believe it will recover its cost basis in Avanex shares given the significant decline in its stock price. (b) As part of Corning's asbestos settlement arrangement to be incorporated into the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation reorganization plan, Corning will contribute, when the reorganization plan becomes effective, 25 million shares of Corning common stock to a trust. This portion of the asbestos liability requires quarterly adjustment based upon movements in Corning's common stock price prior to contribution of the shares to the trust. In the first quarter of 2005, Corning recorded a credit of $16 million for the change in its common stock price of $11.13 at March 31, 2005 compared to $11.77, the common stock price at December 31, 2004.
