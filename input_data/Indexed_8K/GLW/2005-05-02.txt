Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. Item 4.01(a) - former independent registered public accounting firm - ------------------------------------------------------------------- On April 20, 2005, the Benefits Committee of the Corning Incorporated Investment Plan for Unionized Employees (the "Plan") approved the dismissal of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Plan. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on the financial statements of the Plan for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and such report was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through April 20, 2005, there were no disagreements with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on any accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, would have caused it to make reference thereto in connection with its report on the Plan's financial statements for such years. No reportable event as described in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K has occurred during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through April 20, 2005. The Benefits Committee of the Plan requested that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP furnish it with a letter addressed to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of such letter, dated May 2, 2005, is filed as Exhibit 16 to this Form 8-K. Item 4.01(b) - new independent registered public accounting firm - ---------------------------------------------------------------- On April 20, 2005, the Benefits Committee of the Plan appointed Insero, Kasperski, Ciaccia & Co., P.C. as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Plan for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Benefits Committee of the Plan did not consult with Insero, Kasperski, Ciaccia & Co., P.C. during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and through April 20, 2005, on any matter which was the subject of any disagreement or any reportable event as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v), respectively, or on the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Plan's financial statements, relating to which either a written report was provided to the Benefits Committee of the Plan or oral advice was provided that Insero, Kasperski, Ciaccia & Co., P.C. concluded was an important factor considered by the Benefits Committee of the Plan in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue.
