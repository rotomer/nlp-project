FOR RELEASE  JUNE 1, 2005
Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) today announced a public offering of 20 million shares of its common stock for proceeds of approximately $325 million pursuant to its existing $5 billion universal shelf registration statement. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is the sole underwriter for this offering.
CORNING, N.Y. 
Net proceeds from this offering will be used to reduce debt by repurchasing for cash the remaining outstanding zero-coupon convertible debentures due on Nov. 8, 2015, and for general corporate purposes. Such debentures, in an aggregate book value of approximately $275 million, are currently outstanding. Corning will invest the net proceeds from the stock offering in short-term interest-bearing, investment-grade obligations until they are applied as previously described.
James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said, "As a result of this offering and subsequent payment to our bondholders, our current debt-reduction program will be completed. We had a goal to drive our debt below $2 billion this year, and with this transaction, we will achieve this objective."
The shares of common stock represent new financing by Corning. This offering is made by means of a prospectus supplement to a prospectus that is part of Corning's universal shelf registration statement previously filed with the SEC. For a copy of the prospectus and prospectus supplement relating to this offering, contact: Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, New York, N.Y. 10004.
This release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

FOR RELEASE  JUNE 1, 2005
Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer James B. Flaws will discuss the company's growth opportunities during the SG Cowan and Co. 33 Annual Technology Conference in New York tomorrow. Flaws will discuss Corning's businesses including its liquid crystal display (LCD) glass for notebook computers, desktop monitors and LCD TV; diesel emissions-control products for heavy-duty and light-duty engines; and optical fiber, cable hardware and equipment for the fiber-to-the-premises market.
CORNING, N.Y.

"We continue to expect second-quarter sales for the company to be in the range of $1.08 billion to $1.13 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.17 to $0.19, excluding special items," Flaws will say. This EPS estimate is a non-GAAP financial measure and is reconciled in an attachment to this release and on the company's investor relations Web site.
He will also tell investors that the company now expects sequential unit volume growth for its Display Technologies segment in the second quarter to be at the upper end of its guidance of 10 percent to 20 percent. "Due to the strong demand we have seen for our LCD glass in April and May, we now believe that LCD glass unit volume will grow between 15 percent to 20 percent sequentially in the second quarter," Flaws will say.
Flaws will explain to investors that Corning continues to believe that the LCD glass market's overall unit volume is expected to grow in excess of 50 percent in 2005. He will note that supply channel, pricing, currency fluctuations or similar market factors may result in a pause in the future pace of unit sales growth or profitability, but that current market signals remain positive.
At the conference, Flaws will also discuss a recently announced common stock offering of 20 million shares. Net proceeds from this offering will be used to reduce debt by repurchasing for cash the remaining outstanding zero-coupon convertible debentures due on Nov. 8, 2015, and for general corporate purposes. Such debentures, in an aggregate book value of approximately $275 million, are currently outstanding.

"As a result of this offering and subsequent payment to our bondholders our current debt reduction program will be completed," Flaws will say. "We had a goal to drive our debt below $2 billion this year, and with this transaction, we will achieve this objective. With this reduced level of debt, our cash level, our newly completed five-year revolving credit agreement and the restoration of our credit rating to investment grade, we have reached the financial health goals that we set out for ourselves three years ago" he will add.
The shares of common stock represent new financing by Corning. This offering is made by means of a prospectus supplement to a prospectus that is part of Corning's universal shelf registration statement previously filed with the SEC.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP EPS measure excludes restructuring, impairment and other charges and adjustments to prior estimates for such charges. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP measure excludes adjustments to asbestos settlement reserves required by movements in Corning's common stock price, gains and losses arising from debt retirements, charges resulting from the impairment of equity or cost method investments and gains or losses recognized in equity earnings from restructuring, impairment or other charges or credits taken by equity method companies. The company believes presenting a non-GAAP EPS measure is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. This non-GAAP measure is reconciled on the company's Web site at www.corning.com/investor_relations and accompanies this news release.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements
Corning's earnings per share (EPS) excluding special items for the second quarter of 2005 is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company believes presenting non-GAAP EPS is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. A detailed reconciliation is provided below outlining the differences between this non-GAAP measure and the directly related GAAP measure.
Please note that the company may pursue other financing, restructuring and divestiture activities at any time in the future, and that the potential impact of these events is not included within Corning's second quarter 2005 guidance.
