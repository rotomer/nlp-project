Exhibit 1.1 ----------- $100,000,000 Corning Incorporated 6.050% Notes due 2015 --------------------- --------------------------------- Underwriting Agreement --------------------------------- June 16, 2005 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 390 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013 Ladies and Gentlemen: From time to time, Corning Incorporated, a New York corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its debt securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Firm Securities" and, together with any Optional Securities, as defined below, the "Designated Securities"). The Securities will be issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 8, 2000 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee. The particular terms of any issuance of Securities will be determined at the time of offering. 1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the 1
Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement with respect to Designated Securities shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex I and shall specify the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives, if any, of such Underwriters, the principal amount of the Firm Securities and the principal amount of Optional Securities, if any, to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriter with respect thereto, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the nature of the funds to be delivered by the Underwriters, the initial public offering price or the manner of determining such price, if any, including interest rates, if any, maturity, whether such Securities will be convertible at the option of the holder thereof, any conversion rates or price(s), any redemption provisions and any sinking fund requirements. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts, and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted). The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that: (a) One or more registration statements on Form S-3, including a prospectus for use in connection with the Designated Securities pursuant to Rule 429 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), in respect of the Securities have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); such registration statements and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives for each of the other Underwriters and, excluding exhibits to such registration statements, but including all documents incorporated by reference in the prospectuses contained therein, have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; other than a registration statement, if any, increasing the size of the offering (a "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Act, which became effective upon filing, no other document with respect to such registration statements or document incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission; such prospectus included for use in connection with the Securities pursuant to Rule 429 under the Act meets the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder for use of such prospectus in connection with the Securities; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of any of such registration statements, any post effective amendment thereto, or the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened by the Commission. Any preliminary prospectus included in either of such registration statements or filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act is hereinafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus;" the various parts of such registration statements and the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference in the prospectuses contained in such registration statements and the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, at the time such part of such registration statements or such 2
part of the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, became or hereafter becomes effective but excluding Form T-1, each as amended at the time such part of the registration statements or such part of the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, became effective and at the time each incorporated document was filed with the Commission is hereinafter called the "Registration Statement;" the prospectus relating to the Securities, in the form in which it has most recently been filed, or transmitted for filing, with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called the "Prospectus;" any reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the applicable form under the Act, as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; and any reference to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented shall be deemed to refer to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities in the form in which it is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof, including any documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such filing; (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform, and any further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of its date and as of the Time of Delivery as to the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made 3
in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities; (d) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any material loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus; and, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there has not been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus; (e) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus; (f) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus, and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; (g) The Firm Securities and any Optional Securities have been duly and validly authorized, and, when the Firm Securities are issued and delivered pursuant to this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities and in the case of any Optional Securities pursuant to Over-allotment Options (as defined in Section 3 hereof) with respect to such Securities, such Designated Securities will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles and entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture which will be substantially in the form filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement; the Indenture has been duly authorized and, at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities (as defined in Section 4 hereof), the Indenture will constitute a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the Indenture conforms, and the Designated Securities will conform, to the descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented with respect to such Designated Securities; (h) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture, this Agreement and any Pricing Agreement and each Over-allotment Option, if any, and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein 4
contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company or any law, statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Pricing Agreement or any Over-allotment Option, or the Indenture except such as have been, or will have been prior to the Time of Delivery, obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters; (i) The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities and Guarantees" and "Description of the Notes", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities, and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects; (j) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or its properties may be bound, excepting violations or defaults which do not have, or are reasonably likely not to have, an effect which is materially adverse to the assets, business, operations, income or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; (k) Other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others; and (l) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities, will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). 3. Upon the execution of the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Securities and authorization by the Representatives of the release of such Firm Securities, the several 5
Underwriters propose to offer such Firm Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented. The Company may specify in the Pricing Agreement applicable to any Designated Securities that the Company thereby grants to the Underwriters the right (an "Over-allotment Option") to purchase at their election up to the aggregate principal amount of Securities (the "Optional Securities") set forth in such Pricing Agreement, at the terms set forth in the paragraph above, for the sole purpose of covering over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Securities. Any such election to purchase Optional Securities may be exercised only by written notice from the Representatives to the Company, given within a period specified in the Pricing Agreement, setting forth the aggregate principal amount of Optional Securities to be purchased and the date on which such Optional Securities are to be delivered, as determined by the Representatives but in no event earlier than the First Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof) or, unless the Representatives and the Company otherwise agree in writing, earlier than or later than the respective number of business days after the date of such notice set forth in such Pricing Agreement. The aggregate principal amount of Optional Securities to be added to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities shall be, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of Optional Securities which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been attributed to such Underwriter, provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the aggregate principal amount of Optional Securities to be so added shall be, in each case, that proportion of Optional Securities which the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities. The total principal amount of Designated Securities to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement plus the aggregate principal amount of the Optional Securities which the Underwriters elect to purchase. 4. Certificates for the Firm Securities and the Optional Securities, if any, to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in definitive form to the extent practicable and in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request upon at least forty eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by the method specified in such Pricing Agreement, (i) with respect to the Firm Securities, all at the place and time and date specified in such Pricing Agreement or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "First Time of Delivery", and (ii) with respect to the Optional Securities, if any, on the time and date specified by the Representatives in the written notice given by the Representatives of the Underwriters' election to purchase such Optional Securities, or at such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date, if not the First 6
Time of Delivery, herein called the "Second Time of Delivery." Each such time and date for delivery is herein called a "Time of Delivery." "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. 5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities: (a) To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement relating to the applicable Designated Securities or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities and prior to the Time of Delivery for such Securities which amendment or supplement shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Securities promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives promptly of any such amendment or supplement after such Time of Delivery and furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of such Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities or suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its best efforts to obtain its withdrawal; (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction; (c) To furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as 7
then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; (d) To make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 under the Act); (e) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities and continuing to and including the earlier of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for such Designated Securities and (ii) the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities of the Company which are substantially similar to the Designated Securities and which mature more than one year after the related Time of Delivery without your prior written consent; and (f) If the Company elects to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Company shall file a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement with the Commission in compliance with Rule 462(b) by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement, and the Company shall at the time of filing either pay to the Commission the filing fee for the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement or give irrevocable instructions for the payment of such fee pursuant to Rule 111(b) under the Act. 6. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, any Indenture, any Warrant Agreement, any Delayed Delivery Contracts, and Blue Sky and Legal Investment Memoranda and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) any filing fees incident to any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vi) the cost of 8

It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, Section 8 and Section 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make. 7. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed in all material respects all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction; (b) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives such opinion or opinions, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Indenture, the Designated Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (c) William D. Eggers, Esq., General Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives his written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that: (i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of New York, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; 9

general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; (viii) The issue and sale of the Designated Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Designated Securities, the Indenture, any Over-allotment Options, this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company or any law, statute or any violation of any material order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties; (ix) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Designated Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such Pricing Agreement or the Indenture or any Over-allotment Options, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters; (x) The statements set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented under the captions "Description of Debt Securities and Guarantees" and "Description of the Notes", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities and the Designated Securities, and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects; (xi) The Company is not an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act; (xii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which 11
became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and (xiii) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, such counsel shall state that he has no reason to believe that, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or, as of its date, any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the date of any amendment or supplement thereto, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any such further amendment or supplement thereto) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; (d) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of the most recent report filed with the Commission containing financial statements and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, if the date of such report is later than such effective date, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; (e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the 12
Prospectus as amended or supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or government action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; (f) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; (g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or (v) the occurrence of any other material calamity or crises, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented as of the date hereof) relating to the Designated Securities; and (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of each Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to each Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request. 8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become 13
subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities; and provided, further, that the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter under the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus to the extent that the Company demonstrates that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact such Underwriter sold Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or of the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) in any case where such delivery is required by the Act if the Company has previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter and the loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) which was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference)). (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will 14
reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and 15
commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Securities or Optional Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Securities or Optional Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Underwriters' Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Securities or Optional Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Firm Securities or Optional Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Firm Securities or Optional Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Firm Securities or Optional Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Firm Securities or Optional Securities 16
for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall have the right to require each non defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 17
11. If any Pricing Agreement or Over-allotment Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Securities or Optional Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof. 12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement; Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 14. Time shall be of the essence for each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. 15. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 18

"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and its successors, and three other firms that are primary U.S. Government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer") which the Company will specify from time to time; provided, however, that if any of them ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its 7
principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Securities to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date. If the Company decides to redeem less than all of the outstanding Securities, the Trustee will select the Securities to be redeemed: - by lot, - pro rata, or 8
- by any other method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of record of the Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Securities will state, among other things, the amount of Securities to be redeemed, the redemption date, the manner in which the redemption price will be calculated and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Securities to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on any Securities that have been called for redemption at the redemption date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this Series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holders hereof upon the cancellation hereof. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. No sinking fund is provided for the Securities. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of 9
the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected (considered together as one class for this purpose). The Indenture also contains provisions (i) permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected under the Indenture (considered together as one class for this purpose), on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and (ii) permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of any series to be affected under the Indenture (with each such series considered separately for this purpose), on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days 10
after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 11
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

This Security and the Indenture shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

[Corning Incorporated Letterhead] Exhibit 5.1 June 21, 2005 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 390 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013 Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Corning Incorporated, a New York corporation (the "Company"). I am familiar with the authorization, execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement, dated June 16, 2005 (the "Pricing Agreement"), which, unless otherwise specified, incorporates by reference all of the terms and conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, dated June 16, 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement") each between the Company and you (the "Underwriter"). These agreements relate to the issuance and sale of $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.050% Notes due 2015 (the "Notes"); and the preparation on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), of the Registration Statement (File No. 333-57082) relating to the Notes. This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Underwriting Agreement. All capitalized and undefined terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Underwriting Agreement. I have examined executed copies of the Underwriting Agreement, the Pricing Agreement, the Indenture and the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto and the originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents and records of the Company and such public documents and records as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In rendering the opinions set forth below, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. For parties other than the Company, I have also assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons and, that all parties to relevant agreements or instruments had the requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform such agreements or instruments, that such agreements or instruments have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise), executed and delivered by such parties and that such agreements or instruments are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such parties. 1
Based upon the foregoing and having regard for such legal considerations as I have deemed relevant, it is my opinion that: 1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of New York, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; 2. The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; 3. With such exceptions as are not material, the Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties so as to require such qualification; 4. To the best of my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject (other than as set forth in the Prospectus and other than litigation incident to the kind of business conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries, none of which litigation is material to the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole) which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and to the best of my knowledge no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or by others; and I have not received notice that any such proceedings are contemplated by governmental authorities; 5. The Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; 6. The Notes have been duly authorized and issued by the Company and assuming due authentication by the Trustee and upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Pricing Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company, except to the extent that such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and entitled to the benefits provided in the Indenture; and the Notes and the Indenture conform as to legal matters to the descriptions in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; 7. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, 2
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act. 8. The issue and sale of the Notes and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement will not result in a breach of any of the terms of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company or any law, statute or any violation of any material order, rule or regulation known to me of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties; 9. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Notes or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Pricing Agreement or the Indenture except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes by the Underwriter; 10. The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Debt Securities and Guarantees", and "Description of the Notes" as a summary of the terms of the Notes, and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting", describing the provisions of the documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects; 11. The Company is not an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act; 12. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information as to which I express no opinion) when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and 13. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements made by the Company prior to the date for the Notes (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information as to which I express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. I have no reason to believe that, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, the Registration Statement (or, as of its date, any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof) (other than the financial statements, related schedules and 3
other accounting information as to which I express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Prospectus (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information as to which I express no opinion) as of its date and as of the date of any amendment or supplement thereto, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that, as of the date hereof, either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any such further amendment or supplement thereto) (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information as to which I express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and I have no reason to believe that any contracts or other documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information as to which I express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and I do not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required. This opinion is limited to the laws of the state of New York and to the federal laws of the United States of America. The foregoing opinion is being furnished to you solely for your benefit and may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any other person without my prior written consent. Very truly yours, /s/ William D. Eggers 4
