In addition, the Committee shall correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the 2002 Plan, or in any right to purchase shares granted under the 2002 Plan, in the manner and to the extent that the Committee deems desirable to carry the 2002 Plan or any option into effect. The Committee shall, in its sole discretion, make such decisions or determinations and take such actions, and all such decisions, determinations and actions taken or made by the Committee will be conclusive on all parties. The Committee shall not be liable for any decision, determination or action taken in good faith in connection with the administration of the 2002 Plan.
