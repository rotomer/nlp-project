The Securities will be issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 8, 2000 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as Trustee. The particular terms of any issuance of Securities will be determined at the time of offering. 1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of
any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement with respect to Designated Securities shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex I and shall specify the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives, if any, of such Underwriters, the principal amount of the Firm Securities and the principal amount of Optional Securities, if any, to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriter with respect thereto, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the nature of the funds to be delivered by the Underwriters, the initial public offering price or the manner of determining such price, if any, including interest rates, if any, maturity, whether such Securities will be convertible at the option of the holder thereof, any conversion rates or price(s), any redemption provisions and any sinking fund requirements. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts, and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted). The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint. 2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that: (a) One or more registration statements on Form S-3, including a prospectus (the "Base Prospectus") for use in connection with the Designated Securities pursuant to Rule 429 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), in respect of the Securities have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); such registration statements and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives for each of the other Underwriters and, excluding exhibits to such registration statements, but including all documents incorporated by reference in the prospectuses contained therein, have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; other than a registration statement, if any, increasing the size of the offering (a "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Act, which became effective upon filing, no other document with res.ect to such registration statements or document incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission; the Base Prospectus included for use in connection with the Securities pursuant to Rule 429 under the Act meets the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder for use of such prospectus in connection with the Securities; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of any of such registration statements, any post effective amendment thereto, or the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, if any, has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened by the Commission.

(d) To furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto in such quantities as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; (e) To make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 under the Act); (f) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities and continuing to and including the earlier of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for such Designated Securities and (ii) the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities of the Company which are substantially similar to the Designated Securities and which mature more than one year after the related Time of Delivery without your prior written consent; and (g) If the Company elects to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Company shall file a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement with the Commission in compliance with Rule 462(b) by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement, and the Company shall at the time of filing either pay to the Commission the filing fee for the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement or give irrevocable instructions for the payment of such fee pursuant to Rule 111(b) under the Act. 6. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, any Indenture, any Warrant Agreement, any Delayed Delivery Contracts, and Blue Sky and Legal Investment Memoranda and any other documents in connection

The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are true and correct, at and as of each Time of Delivery and Time of Sale for such Designated Securities ("Time of Sale" shall mean, with respect to any obligation of an Underwriter to purchase the Designated Securities, the time when the related Pricing Agreement becomes effective or if there is no Pricing Agreement, the time when the Underwriter becomes committed to purchase such Designated Securities), the condition that the Company shall have performed in all material respects all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) Preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; the final term sheet contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof and any other material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction;
(b) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives such opinion or opinions, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Indenture, the Designated Securities, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (c) William D. Eggers, Esq., General Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives his written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that: (i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of New York, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package; (ii) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non assessable; (iii) With such exceptions as are not material, the Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties so as to require such qualification (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause upon opinions of local counsel, and, as to matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company, provided that such counsel shall state that he believes that both you and he are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates); (iv) To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus as supplemented or amended and the Pricing Disclosure Package, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject (other than as set forth in the Prospectus as supplemented or amended and the Pricing Disclosure Package and other than litigation incident to the kind of business conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries, none of which litigation is material to the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole) which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and to the best of such counsel's knowledge no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or by others; and such counsel has not received notice that any such proceedings are contemplated by governmental authorities;
(v) This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; (vi) The Designated Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles and entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture; and the Designated Securities and the Indenture conform as to legal matters to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package; provided, however, that for the purposes of this paragraph (vi), such counsel may state that he has assumed that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Debt Securities have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers; (vii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; (viii) The issue and sale of the Designated Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Designated Securities, the Indenture, any Over-allotment Options, this Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By Laws of the Company or any law, statute or any violation of any material order, rule or regulation known to such counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties; (ix) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Designated Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or such Pricing Agreement or the Indenture or any Over-allotment Options, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Designated Securities by the Underwriters;
(x) The statements set forth in the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented under the caption "Description of Debt Securities and Guarantees", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities and the Designated Securities, and under the caption "Plan of Distribution", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects, and the statements set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented under the captions "Description of Debt Securities and Guarantees" and "Description of the Notes", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities and the Designated Securities, and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects; (xi) The Company is not an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act; (xii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and (xiii) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, such counsel shall state that he has no reason to believe that, (i) each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the documents specified in a schedule to such counsel's letter, consisting of those included in the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the
Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (iii) the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the date of any amendment or supplement thereto, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iv) as of the Time of Delivery, either the documents specified in a schedule to such counsel's letter, consisting of those included in the Pricing Disclosure Package, or the Prospectus (or any such further amendment or supplement thereto) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and such counsel does not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required; (d) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of the Pricing Agreement, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; (e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or government action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented; (f) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;
(g) On or after the Applicable Time, there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or (v) the occurrence of any other material calamity or crises, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented as of the date hereof) relating to the Designated Securities; and (h) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of each Time of Delivery, and at and as of the applicable Time of Sale, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to each Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request. 8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities. (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Securities or Optional Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Securities or Optional Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Underwriters' Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Securities or Optional Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Firm Securities or Optional Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Firm Securities or Optional Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Firm Securities or Optional Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Firm Securities or Optional Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Securities or Optional Securities, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters,

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after August 15, 2026, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue
(expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date. If the Company decides to redeem less than all of the outstanding Securities, the Trustee will select the Securities to be redeemed: o by lot, o pro rata, or o by any other method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of record of the Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Securities will state, among other things, the amount of Securities to be redeemed, the redemption date, the manner in which the redemption price will be calculated and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Securities to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on any Securities that have been called for redemption at the redemption date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this Series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holders hereof upon the cancellation hereof. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. No sinking fund is provided for the Securities. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected (considered together as one class for this purpose). The Indenture also contains provisions (i) permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected under the Indenture (considered together as one class for this purpose), on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and (ii) permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of any series to be affected under the Indenture (with each such series considered separately for this purpose), on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of
any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

Exhibit 5.1 August 1, 2006 Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 390 Greenwich Street New York, StateNew York PostalCode10013 Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Corning Incorporated, a placeStateNew York corporation (the "Company"). I am familiar with the authorization, execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement, dated July 27, 2006 (the "Pricing Agreement"), which, unless otherwise specified, incorporates by reference all of the terms and conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, dated July 27, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), each between the Company and you (the "Underwriter"). These agreements relate to the issuance and sale of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.250% Notes due 2036 (the "Notes"); and the preparation on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), of the Registration Statement (File No. 333-57082) relating to the Notes. This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Underwriting Agreement. All capitalized and undefined terms used in my letter shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Underwriting Agreement. I have examined executed copies of the Underwriting Agreement, the Pricing Agreement, the Indenture and the Registration Statement and all amendments thereto and the originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents and records of the Company and such public documents and records as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below. In rendering the opinions set forth below, I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the conformity to authentic originals of all documents submitted to me as copies. For parties other than the Company, I have also assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons and that all parties to relevant agreements or instruments had the requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform these agreements or instruments, that these agreements or instruments have been duly authorized by all requisite action (corporate or otherwise), executed and delivered by such parties and that these agreements or instruments are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such parties.
Based upon the foregoing and having regard for the legal considerations as I have deemed relevant, it is my opinion that: 1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of New York, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package; 2. The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; 3. With such exceptions as are not material, the Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties so as to require such qualification; 4. To the best of my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject (other than as set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package and other than litigation incident to the kind of business conducted by the Company and its subsidiaries, none of which litigation is material to the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole) which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and to the best of my knowledge no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or by others; and I have not received notice that any such proceedings are contemplated by governmental authorities. I note that on July 28, 2006, the Company received notice of an action by the State of Illinois, through its Attorney General, in the McHenry County Circuit Court seeking an injunction pertaining to the site of a former facility in Crystal Lake, Illinois, requiring the Company to provide an alternative method of supplying safe drinking water to all affected and potentially affected residents and to conduct an investigation of the impacted area to define the nature and extent of the alleged contamination. I believe this action will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations, but note this matter was recently received and under investigation. 5. The Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; 6. The Notes have been duly executed, authorized and issued by the Company and assuming due authentication by the Trustee and upon payment and delivery in accordance with the
Pricing Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company, except to the extent that such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and entitled to the benefits provided in the Indenture; and the Notes and the Indenture conform as to legal matters to their descriptions in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package; 7. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; 8. The issue and sale of the Notes and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company or any law, statute or any violation of any material order, rule or regulation known to me of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties; 9. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Notes or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Pricing Agreement or the Indenture except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes by the Underwriter; 10. The statements set forth in the Base Prospectus, as amended or supplemented at 1:00 p.m. on July 27, 2006, under the caption "Description of Debt Securities and Guarantees", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Notes, and under the caption "Plan of Distribution", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects, and the statements set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented under the captions "Description of Debt Securities and Guarantees" and "Description of the Notes", insofar as they purport to
constitute a summary of the terms of the Notes, and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair in all material respects; 11. The Company is not an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act; 12. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which I express no opinion) when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and 13. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto made by the Company prior to the date hereof (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which I express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. I have no reason to believe that (i) the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information, contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which I express no opinion), when it became effective (and each part thereto), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the documents specified in Schedule A hereto, as of 1:00 p.m. on July 27, 2006, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (iii) the Prospectus (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information, contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which I express no opinion), as of its date and as of the date of any amendment or supplement thereto, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iv) as of the date hereof, either document specified in Schedule A hereto (or any such further amendment or supplement thereto)(other than the financial statements, related schedules and other
accounting information, contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which I express no opinion), contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and I have no reason to believe that any contracts or other documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and the Pricing Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements, related schedules and other accounting information, contained or incorporated by reference therein, or omitted therefrom, as to which I express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and I do not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required. This opinion is limited to the laws of the state of StateNew York and to the federal laws of the placecountry-regionUnited States of America. The foregoing opinion is being furnished to you solely for your benefit and may not be relied upon by, nor may copies be delivered to, any other person without my prior written consent. Very truly yours, /S/ WILLIAM D. EGGERS
