Overview of Business Segment Results
Third-quarter sales for Corning's Display Technologies segment were $705 million, a 16% sequential increase, and a 39% increase over the third quarter 2006. The display segment results were also positively impacted by a favorable U.S.-dollar-to-Japanese-yen exchange rate in the quarter.
 
Telecommunications segment sales in the third quarter were $472 million, an 8% sequential increase and a 4% increase over the third quarter 2006. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of the submarine cabling business, sales were up 10%* over the second quarter and 13%* over the third quarter 2006. The strong third-quarter performance was driven by growth throughout the segment, including increased demand for fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) products and private network projects. During the third quarter, the company began shipments to a new European FTTP customer.
 
Environmental Technologies segment sales in the third quarter were $198 million, a 4% sequential increase and a 29% increase over the third quarter 2006. Corning's Life Sciences segment had sales of $78 million, remaining even with last quarter, and 15% higher than a year ago.
 
Corning's equity earnings from Dow Corning were $81 million in the third quarter, compared to $88 million in the second quarter and $78 million a year ago. Third-quarter equity earnings include a $4 million nonrecurring tax charge.
 
The company's third-quarter results included two special items: a credit of $16 million related to the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation settlement and $18 million of restructuring charges in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Company, Ltd. Samsung Corning is Corning's 50-percent owned equity venture in Korea which manufactures glass panels and funnels for cathode ray tubes for conventional televisions and computer monitors.
 
Fourth-Quarter 2007 Outlook
"The overall display market appears healthy heading into the fourth quarter. Retail market indicators continue to point toward a strong consumer holiday buying season for electronic goods such as LCD televisions, laptop computers and flat screen monitors. We currently see no evidence of credit concerns in the U.S. impacting consumers' purchasing decisions," James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said.

"Compared to last year, we expect our fourth-quarter sales to be up about 10% to 13% and our EPS, before special items, to increase 16% to 22%.* These fourth-quarter results will bring our full-year sales growth to about 12% and our full-year EPS growth, before special items, to at least 21%* over 2006, bringing us another outstanding year of performance for Corning," Flaws said.
 
Looking forward to 2008, Flaws said that Corning's current view is that the LCD glass market will expand by at least 400 million square feet, driven primarily by the growth of LCD television demand. This square-footage growth is similar to that experienced in both 2006 and 2007. Corning intends to continue its current pricing strategy in 2008.

Presentation of Information in this News Release
Non-GAAP financial measures are indicated with an ASTERISK and not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP net income and EPS measures exclude restructuring, impairment and other charges and adjustments to prior estimates for such charges. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP measures exclude adjustments to asbestos settlement reserves required by movements in Corning's common stock price, gains and losses arising from debt retirements, charges or credits arising from adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, equity method charges resulting from impairments of equity method investments or restructuring, impairment or other charges taken by equity method companies, and gains from discontinued operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP net income and EPS measures is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled on the company's Web site at
www.corning.com/investor_relations
and accompanies this news release.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
 
On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against Corning and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC), which might arise from PCC products or operations. The proposed settlement, if approved, will require Corning to relinquish its equity interest in PCC, contribute its equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), a Belgian corporation, and contribute 25 million shares of Corning common stock. Corning also agreed to make cash payments with a value of $131 million, in March 2003, over six years from the effective date of the settlement and to assign insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance at the time of the settlement.
 
As a result of the proposed asbestos settlement, any changes in the estimated settlement value of the components of the proposed settlement agreement will be recognized in Corning's quarterly results until the date of the contribution to the settlement trust. In the third quarter of 2007, Corning recorded a credit of $16 million (pretax and after-tax) including a mark-to-market credit of $23 million reflecting the decrease in Corning's common stock from June 30, 2007 to September 30, 2007 and a $7 million charge to adjust the estimated settlement value of certain other components of the proposed asbestos settlement.
 
Beginning with the first quarter of 2003, Corning has recorded total net charges of $987 million to reflect the estimated settlement value of our asbestos liability.
 
 
In the third quarter of 2007, equity in earnings of associated companies includes an $18 million charge (net of tax) for Corning's share of restructuring and impairment charges at Samsung Corning Co., Ltd., a South Korea-based manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for cathode ray tube television and display monitors.
