"Our strong fourth-quarter performance contributed to an outstanding year for Corning," Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "We delivered all-time records in gross margin percent, net income, EPS and operating cash flow in 2007. Our 38% annual volume growth in display and continued leadership in developing innovative solutions such as EAGLE XG, Jade glass for advanced displays and Vita, an OLED sealing solution for the flat panel industry, were highlights of the year."
 
"Additionally, we saw a greater than 50% increase in diesel product sales and a record level of automotive product sales in 2007. We also placed our first Epic Systems with pharmaceutical and research companies, and introduced ClearCurve, our revolutionary new ultra-bendable fiber solution."

Fourth-Quarter Segment Results
Fourth-quarter sales for Corning's Display Technologies segment were $774 million, a 10% sequential increase, and a 25% increase over fourth-quarter 2006. The display segment results were positively influenced by continued strong global demand for LCD televisions and notebook computers and positive foreign exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter. Sequential price declines were moderate again this quarter.

Telecommunications segment sales for the quarter were $430 million, a 9% decline sequentially. The sequential decline was the result of normal seasonal slowdowns.
 
Environmental Technologies segment sales for the fourth quarter were $189 million, a 5% sequential decline but a 22% increase over the fourth quarter of 2006. The environmental segment continued to have stronger-than-expected automotive products sales. Corning's Life Sciences segment sales were $75 million for the quarter.
 
Corning's equity earnings from Dow Corning were $83 million for the quarter, compared to $81 million in the third quarter and $83 million a year ago.
 
First-Quarter Outlook
"We have good momentum in our display business heading into the first quarter," James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said. "We believe first-quarter panel maker inventory levels are lower this year than last year. We expect panel makers to maintain high utilization rates throughout the first quarter, which will drive continued strong glass demand. Looking forward, we anticipate the LCD glass supply and demand balance will remain tight throughout the year, absent the impact of any potential downturn in the economy."
 
Corning expects first-quarter sales to be in the range of $1.59 billion to $1.62 billion and earnings per share, before special items, in the range of $0.41 to $0.43*, compared to $1.31 billion in sales and $0.28* in earnings per share, excluding special items, in the first quarter of 2007.
 
Business Highlights
 
"We feel good about our strong start to 2008, and believe we will have excellent first-quarter performance," Flaws said. "As of today, we have not seen any significant impact from a potential slowing of the U.S. economy other than the slowdown in the trucking industry, which will negatively impact our diesel product sales. However, we are closely monitoring each of our businesses for any signs that would indicate a slowdown and will promptly notify investors of any significant change."

Presentation of Information in this News Release
Non-GAAP financial measures are indicated with an ASTERISK and not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP net income and EPS measures exclude restructuring, impairment and other charges and adjustments to prior estimates for such charges. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP measures exclude adjustments to asbestos settlement reserves required by movements in Corning's common stock price, gains and losses arising from debt retirements, charges or credits arising from adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, equity method charges resulting from impairments of equity method investments or restructuring, impairment or other charges taken by equity method companies, and gains from discontinued operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP net income and EPS measures is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled on the company's Web site at

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
 
On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against Corning and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC), which might arise from PCC products or operations. The proposed settlement, if approved, will require Corning to relinquish its equity interest in PCC, contribute its equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), a Belgian corporation, and contribute 25 million shares of Corning common stock. Corning also agreed to make cash payments with a value of $131 million, in March 2003, over six years from the effective date of the settlement and to assign insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance at the time of the settlement.
 
As a result of the proposed asbestos settlement, any changes in the estimated settlement value of the components of the proposed settlement agreement will be recognized in Corning's quarterly results until the date of the contribution to the settlement trust. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Corning recorded a charge of $15 million (pretax and after-tax) including a mark-to-market credit of $17 million reflecting the decrease in Corning's common stock from September 30, 2007 to December 31, 2007 and a $32 million charge to adjust the estimated settlement value of certain other components of the proposed asbestos settlement.
 
Beginning with the first quarter of 2003, Corning has recorded total net charges of $1.0 billion to reflect the estimated settlement value of our asbestos liability.
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2007, Corning recorded a $103 million tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in Germany.
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2007, equity in earnings of affiliated companies includes a $14 million charge (net of tax) for Corning's share of restructuring, impairment and other charges at Samsung Corning Co. Ltd. (Samsung Corning). On December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co. Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision) acquired all of the assets of Samsung Corning. Corning's 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision was unchanged by this transaction.
