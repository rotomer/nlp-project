Effective January 1, 2008, Corning changed its internal reporting structure to better reflect the company's focus on new business development and later-stage research projects and to provide more transparency on our specialty materials operating segment.

All other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as "All Other." This group is now primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines.
 
The following provides historical segment information reflecting these changes for 2007, 2006, and 2005 and quarterly information for 2007.
