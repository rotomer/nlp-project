Corning Reports Strong First-Quarter Earnings
 
Significant year-over-year growth
 
CORNING, N.Y. 
Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) today announced results for the first quarter of 2008.
 
First-Quarter Highlights
 
Second-Quarter Outlook Highlights
 
Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "This was a tremendously strong quarter for Corning. Display glass demand remains robust and we continue to operate our LCD glass substrate facilities at full capacity. The global consumer appetite for LCD televisions continues to grow." Weeks noted that very strong manufacturing performance in Corning's Display Technologies segment also contributed to the excellent first-quarter results.
 
*These are non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided in the tables following this news release, as well as on the company's investor relations website.

"Given the strength of LCD TV in the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect the global LCD glass market to grow at the upper end of the 25% to 30% range that we provided earlier this year," Weeks added.
 
Quarter One Financial Comparisons
 
 
 
Overview of Business Segment Results
First-quarter sales for Corning's Display Technologies segment were $829 million, a 7% sequential increase and a 58% increase over the first quarter 2007. The display segment results were positively impacted by a favorable U.S.-dollar-to-Japanese-yen exchange rate in the quarter. Price declines were consistent with previous quarters.
 
Telecommunications segment sales in the first quarter were $421 million, a 2% sequential decline and a 4% decline from quarter one 2007. Strong optical fiber volume and higher fiber-to-the-premises sales were offset primarily by the slow start of several customer projects. Corning anticipates that some of these projects will begin in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of last year's divestiture of Corning's submarine cabling business, quarter one sales increased 3%* versus last year.
 
Environmental Technologies segment sales in the first quarter were $197 million, a 4% sequential increase and a nearly 10% increase over the first quarter 2007.
 
Specialty Materials segment sales were $83 million, about even with quarter one 2007 results. The Life Sciences segment had sales of $81 million, a 10% sequential increase and a 7% increase from quarter one 2007.
 
Corning's equity earnings from Dow Corning were $80 million in the first quarter, compared to $84 million in the previous quarter and $92 million a year ago. Dow Corning's results were impacted by higher raw material prices.

Special Items
The company's first-quarter results included a non-cash credit of $327 million pretax and after-tax related to the pending Pittsburgh Corning Corporation bankruptcy proceeding. As a result of significant progress made on negotiating a revised plan of reorganization, Corning reduced its estimated liability for the asbestos settlement from about $1 billion to $675 million.
 
Second-Quarter 2008 Outlook
James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said, "Global demand for LCD televisions and laptop computers remains strong going into the second quarter. We continue to closely monitor the U.S. retail market, but we have not seen any indication that the U.S. slowdown is impacting our LCD glass business."
 
Business Highlights
 
Full-Year Outlook
 
Flaws noted that the company is increasing its capital spending plan for the year to $1.8 to $2.0 billion. This increase is driven primarily by the acceleration of LCD capacity in anticipation of a stronger display market, and growing demand for Corning's new Gorilla glass. Higher precious metals prices are also contributing to the increased capital spending. "Despite this increase, we still expect our free cash flow to be at least $500 million* this year," Flaws said.
 
Flaws added that, due to the continued slowdown in the U.S. freight industry, Corning now expects domestic Class 8 truck engine production to come in at the lower end of its estimated range of 175,000 to 225,000 this year. As a result, Corning has adjusted its expectation for diesel product sales to grow 15% to 20% this year, versus its original expectation of at least 25%.
 
"Our first-quarter results have given us strong momentum heading into the second quarter," Flaws said. "Although cautious, we look forward to another excellent quarter for Corning."

Presentation of Information in this News Release
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP net income and EPS measures exclude restructuring, impairment and other charges and adjustments to prior estimates for such charges. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP measures exclude adjustments to asbestos settlement reserves required by movements in Corning's common stock price, gains and losses arising from debt retirements, charges or credits arising from adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, equity method charges resulting from impairments of equity method investments or restructuring, impairment or other charges taken by equity method companies, and gains from discontinued operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP net income and EPS measures is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled on the company's Web site at
www.corning.com/investor_relations
and accompanies this news release.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
 
On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against Corning and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) which might arise from PCC products or operations (the 2003 Plan). On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 Plan. On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization (the Amended PCC Plan) that resolved issues raised by the Court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 Plan.
 
As a result of progress in the parties' continuing negotiations, Corning believes the Amended PCC Plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and the probability that the 2003 plan will become effective has diminished. The proposed settlement under the Amended PCC Plan requires Corning to contribute its equity interest in PCC and Pittsburgh Corning Europe, N.V. (PCE) and to contribute a fixed series of cash payments, recorded at present value on March 31, 2008. Corning will have the option to contribute shares rather than cash, but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not number of shares. As a result, the estimated asbestos settlement liability will no longer be impacted by movements in the value of Corning common stock. The Amended PCC Plan does not include non-PCC asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against Corning. Corning has recorded an additional amount for such claims in its estimated asbestos settlement liability.
 
Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2008, Corning recorded an asbestos settlement credit of $327 million to adjust the asbestos settlement liability from $1 billion to $675 million, including the components of the Amended PCC Plan and the estimated liability for non-PCC asbestos claims.
