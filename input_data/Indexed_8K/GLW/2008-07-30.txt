Corning Announces Second-Quarter Results

Remarking on the second quarter, Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Despite concerns of a U.S. economic slowdown, Corning performed very well in the second quarter. We saw continued strong demand for our LCD glass substrates throughout the quarter. The U.S. retail data reported by the NPD Group's retail tracking service for the month of June showed retail sales of LCD TV units up 35% year over year. This is consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year where LCD TV units sold increased 37% over a year ago." The NPD Group is an independent consumer market research firm.
 
"Additionally, we were very pleased with our Telecommunications segment performance, where sequential sales growth was 13%," Weeks said.
 
Quarter Two Financial Comparisons
 
Overview of Business Segment Results
Second-quarter sales for Corning's Display Technologies segment were $809 million, a 2% sequential decline, but a 33% increase over the second quarter 2007. Year-over-year glass volume increased by 26%. The display segment results were negatively impacted by an isolated manufacturing interruption which impacted shipments to one customer during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the interruption, sequential volume for the wholly owned business would have been within the original guidance of 2% to 5% growth. The manufacturing interruption reduced Corning's second-quarter sales by $24 million and net income by $16 million. Also, second-quarter sales and net income were negatively impacted by the weaker-than-expected yen-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate in the quarter versus guidance. Normal price declines were within the anticipated range for the quarter.
 
Telecommunications segment sales in the second quarter were $477 million, a 13% sequential increase and a 9% increase over a year ago. The increase was driven by strong fiber-to-the-premises demand as well as overall strength in optical fiber sales.
 
Environmental Technologies segment sales were $209 million in the second quarter, a 6% sequential improvement and a 9% increase over a year ago. Diesel product sales were strong in the second quarter, offset somewhat by a decline in automotive product demand.

Specialty Materials segment sales were $104 million, a 25% sequential increase and a 9% increase over second quarter 2007. The Life Sciences segment had sales of $87 million, a 7% sequential increase and a 12% increase over the second quarter last year. The positive year-over-year sales comparisons in the Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, and Life Sciences segments reflected stronger euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates.
 
Corning's second-quarter equity earnings were $360 million, an 18% sequential increase and a more than 50% increase over the second quarter 2007. The company's equity earnings from Dow Corning were $94 million, compared to $80 million in the previous quarter and $88 million a year ago.
 
Special Items
The company's second-quarter results included net special gains of $2.429 billion or $1.52 per share.  This amount includes a charge of $12 million pretax and after-tax to settle litigation in the company's Display Technologies segment and a non-cash charge of $9 million pretax and after-tax related to the pending Pittsburgh Corning Corporation bankruptcy proceeding. In the quarter, the company also released U.S. deferred tax asset valuation allowances totaling $2.45 billion, a non-cash item.
 
As a result of the valuation allowance release, Corning expects that its ongoing effective tax rate will increase by about 10 percentage points in 2009. This will not affect the company's 2008 ongoing tax rate. James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said, "The most important factor behind the timing of the release of the U.S. valuation allowance is our increased confidence in sustained profitability in the U.S. The potential increase in next year's tax rate has been previously disclosed and is in most analysts' 2009 estimates." Flaws added, "Corning continues to have a large U.S. net operating loss carryforward and does not expect to pay cash taxes in the U.S. for at least four to five years."
 
Third-Quarter Outlook
"We have recently seen some panel makers, primarily in Taiwan, reduce their utilization rates due to what we believe is an inventory build at the set assembly level of the supply chain. Despite this normal supply chain correction, we continue to believe that the LCD glass market will grow at the upper end of our original guidance range of 25% to 30% this year because retail demand for LCD products has remained strong," Flaws said.

Business Segment Highlights
 
"Overall, we believe Corning is more resistant to materials and energy inflation than it has been in the past due to cost reduction and changes in business mix. However, our Life Sciences segment and Corning Cable Systems business have seen significant material cost increases and will be implementing prices increases to offset these costs. Dow Corning is also experiencing significant inflation in certain raw materials costs and has implemented price increases as a result," Flaws added.
 
"While there are economic and supply-chain risks facing us in the second half of the year, we remain optimistic about our key areas of opportunity," Flaws said. "LCD TV sales have been globally strong this year and this trend continued through June in the U.S. and other regions. Despite fears of a continued impact of the earthquake in China, preliminary June retail data shows LCD TV sales up over 60% over the prior year," he remarked. The preliminary retail data was supplied by a private Chinese-based market research company.
 
"The continued retail strength is very encouraging as we enter the second half of the year, which is typically the more robust retail season for electronic goods," Flaws said.
 
Separately, Corning announced earlier today that its board of directors and executive committee approved a new stock repurchase plan of up to $1 billion that will run through 2009. This is in addition to last year's $500 million repurchase authorization of which $125 million remains.

Presentation of Information in this News Release
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP net income and EPS measures exclude restructuring, impairment and other charges and adjustments to prior estimates for such charges. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP measures exclude adjustments to asbestos settlement reserves required by movements in Corning's common stock price, gains and losses arising from debt retirements, charges or credits arising from adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, equity method charges resulting from impairments of equity method investments or restructuring, impairment or other charges taken by equity method companies, and gains from discontinued operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP net income and EPS measures is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. These
non-GAAP measures are reconciled on the company's Web site at
www.corning.com/investor_relations
and accompanies this news release.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
 
On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against Corning and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) which might arise from PCC products or operations (the 2003 Plan). On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 Plan. On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization (the Amended PCC Plan) that resolved issues raised by the Court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 Plan.
 
As a result of progress in the parties' continuing negotiations, Corning believes the Amended PCC Plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and the probability that the 2003 plan will become effective has diminished. The proposed settlement under the Amended PCC Plan requires Corning to contribute its equity interest in PCC and Pittsburgh Corning Europe, N.V. (PCE) and to contribute a fixed series of cash payments, recorded at present value on June 30, 2008. Corning will have the option to contribute shares rather than cash, but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not number of shares. As a result, the estimated asbestos settlement liability is no longer impacted by movements in the value of Corning common stock. The Amended PCC Plan does not include non-PCC asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against Corning. Corning has recorded an additional amount for such claims in its estimated asbestos settlement liability.
 
In the first quarter of 2008, we recorded a $327 million reduction to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under the Amended PCC Plan and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms of the 2003 Plan. In the second quarter of 2008, we recorded an asbestos settlement charge of $9 million to adjust the asbestos settlement liability for the change in value of the components of the Amended PCC Plan and the estimated liability for non-PCC asbestos claims.
 
 
In the second quarter of 2008, Corning recorded a charge of $12 million to settle litigation associated with our Display Technologies segment.
 
 
In the second quarter of 2008, Corning concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize substantially all of its U.S. deferred tax assets because the Company expects to generate sufficient levels of income in the U.S. As a result, Corning released $2.45 billion of valuation allowances on its U.S. deferred tax assets.
