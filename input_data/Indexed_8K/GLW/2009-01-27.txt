Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The Corning Incorporated press release dated January 27, 2009 regarding its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008 and its first quarter 2009 earnings guidance is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.
 
The information in this report, being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, and is not incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On January 27, 2009, Corning Incorporated issued a press release including the announcement that it will
recognize certain charges against its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009 as a result of a restructuring plan. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99, and its "Restructuring Plans" section is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On January 26, 2009, Corning committed to a restructuring plan to reduce its workforce by 3,500 employees. Corning made the decision to restructure because of the shift in its core businesses in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the economic recession and resulting lower anticipated 2009 sales levels. Corning expects to complete this restructuring plan by the end of 2009. We estimate the total costs of this plan to be in the range of $115 million to $165 million, of which total cash expenditures are expected to be roughly $105 million to $150 million related to termination benefits.

Restructuring Plans
 
"We experienced a significant momentum shift in many of our core businesses in the fourth quarter as the recession took hold," Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "As a result, we are adjusting our operations to reflect anticipated lower sales in 2009. We are also moving aggressively to reduce operating expenses and capital spending to continue to meet our goals of positive free cash flow and a healthy balance sheet."
 
Fourth-Quarter Segment Results
Sales in the Display Technologies segment were $390 million, down 44% sequentially and 50% year over year. This significant decline resulted primarily from the supply chain's inventory reduction and lower retail sales of LCD products. Sequential price declines were slightly higher than the previous quarter. Positive foreign exchange rate movements partially offset the volume declines.
 
Telecommunications segment sales were $405 million, down 18% sequentially and 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.

Environmental Technologies segment sales were $128 million, down 28% sequentially and 32% year over year. Fourth-quarter sales of automotive products declined sharply reflecting the global decline in the automotive industry. Heavy-duty diesel sales remained weak.
 
Corning's equity earnings from Dow Corning Corporation were $86 million, down sequentially as the recession began to impact the demand for silicone products, but up slightly year over year.
 
Looking Forward
James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said, "We anticipate a slow start to 2009 with first-quarter combined display volume down 20% to 25% as the supply chain continues to reduce inventory during the seasonally weaker retail sales quarter. As we announced last December, we will also have high-single-digit price declines in the first quarter. As a result, sales, gross margin and net income will be sequentially lower. We expect earnings per share*, before special items, to be about break-even in the first quarter."
 
"On the other hand, recent news about the display supply chain and end market is encouraging. Retail sales of LCD TV were stronger in December than we anticipated and this trend is continuing into early January. We estimate that the display supply chain has reduced total inventory levels to be close to year-end 2007 levels. This reduction, while painful for us in the fourth quarter, moves us closer to the day that glass demand rebounds. We are currently anticipating a significant increase in glass demand in the second quarter
.
 
"During these tough times, our three priorities are preserving cash, restructuring the company to be profitable at a lower sales level, and accelerating new products while maintaining our focus on long-term growth opportunities," he said.
 
The company is concentrating on its short-term growth opportunities by investing in Gen 10 LCD manufacturing, extending its bend-insensitive ClearCurveoptical fiber products into new markets, introducing next-generation advanced diesel engine substrates and filters, expanding applications for its Gorilla glass and pursuing new initiatives in thin-film photovoltaics.
 
As previously announced, the company has reduced its 2009 capital spending to $1.1 billion, of which about $525 million relates to construction completed in 2008. "We have a goal of being free cash flow positive for the year, but expect our first-half free cash flow to be negative," he said.
 
Flaws said that Corning is sizing the company's cost structure for about $5 billion of sales in 2009. "This level is above our first-quarter run rate and reflects our belief that the display supply chain contraction will end in the second quarter. If we do not see this improvement, we will consider further consolidation of manufacturing facilities and additional workforce reductions."

Flaws concluded by noting that, "despite the current impact of the global recession, we remain well positioned in our core businesses for the long term. This recession will end. The exact timing is difficult to predict but we know that the world is not going backwards. Optical fiber solutions will continue to replace older copper lines and LCD televisions are making CRT models obsolete. And stronger environmental regulations will soon be taking effect. Demand for our products will increase as the economy improves."
 
Corning will provide more information on its 2009 outlook at its annual investor relations meeting in New York on Friday, Feb. 6 at 9 a.m. ET at the Times Center. Attendees can register online at the company's investor relations web site. The company also will be presenting at the Thomas Weisel Telecom and Technology Conference on Feb. 10 in San Francisco.

Presentation of Information in this News Release
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP net income and EPS measures exclude restructuring, impairment and other charges and adjustments to prior estimates for such charges. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP measures exclude adjustments to asbestos settlement reserves, gains and losses arising from debt retirements, charges or credits arising from adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, equity method charges resulting from impairments of equity method investments or restructuring, impairment or other charges taken by equity method companies and gains from discontinued operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP net income and EPS measures is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled on the company's Web site at
www.corning.com/investor_relations
and accompany this news release.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, Corning recorded a charge of $22 million pretax and $21 million after-tax, which was comprised primarily of severance costs for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment.
 
 
On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against Corning and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) which might arise from PCC products or operations (the 2003 Plan). On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 Plan. On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization (the Amended PCC Plan) that resolved issues raised by the Court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 Plan.
 
As a result of progress in the parties' continuing negotiations, Corning believes the Amended PCC Plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and the probability that the 2003 plan will become effective has diminished. The proposed settlement under the Amended PCC Plan requires Corning to contribute its equity interest in PCC and Pittsburgh Corning Europe, N.V. (PCE) and to contribute a fixed series of cash payments, recorded at present value on December 31, 2008. Corning will have the option to contribute shares rather than cash, but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not number of shares. As a result, the estimated asbestos settlement liability is no longer impacted by movements in the value of Corning common stock. The Amended PCC Plan does not include non-PCC asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against Corning. Corning has recorded an additional amount for such claims in its estimated asbestos settlement liability.
 
In the first quarter of 2008, we recorded a $327 million reduction to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under the Amended PCC Plan and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms of the 2003 Plan. In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2008, we recorded pretax and after-tax charges of $9 million, $6 million and a credit of $28 million, respectively to adjust the asbestos settlement liability for the change in value of the components of the Amended PCC Plan.
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, Corning recorded a pretax and after-tax loss of $11 million on certain available-for-sale securities that were included in cash and short-term investments.
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, Corning released an additional $45 million of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of current-year U.S. taxable income.
