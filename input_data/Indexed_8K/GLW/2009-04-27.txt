"We were very pleased with our first-quarter performance given the high level of economic uncertainty we were facing," Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "The biggest questions we had coming into the first quarter were first, would the strong LCD TV sales rate continue in this tough environment, and second, when would the display supply chain contraction end? It was satisfying to see the continued strength of LCD TV sales at retail worldwide throughout the first quarter. We were also pleased to see demand for our glass pick up sooner than we anticipated, an indication that the display supply chain contraction was ending. These contributed to stronger-than-expected sales and earnings performance this quarter."
 
First-Quarter Segment Results
Sales in the Display Technologies segment were $357 million, down 8% sequentially. Sequential price declines were significant, but in line with the company's expectations. Positive foreign exchange rate movements basically offset the slight volume decline in the wholly owned business.
 
Telecommunications segment sales were $385 million, down 5% sequentially. Stronger optical fiber, cable and private network demand in China was offset by lower private network, cable, and hardware and equipment sales in North America.
 
Environmental Technologies segment sales were $110 million, down 14% sequentially, mirroring the difficulties experienced in the global automotive industry and continued weakness in heavy-duty diesel sales in the U.S.
 
Corning's equity earnings were $195 million, down significantly from last year's fourth-quarter equity earnings of $288 million. Equity earnings from Dow Corning Corporation were $5 million, an appreciable decline from the fourth quarter. First-quarter equity earnings from Dow Corning include $29 million in restructuring charges. Samsung Corning Precision's equity earnings contribution was $187 million, down 2% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Volume gains were more than offset by price declines, which were higher than Corning's wholly owned business.
 
Looking Forward
James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said, "While economic uncertainty remains, we are expecting strong growth in display as our customers continue to ramp their capacity to match end market demand. We anticipate sequential volumes at our wholly owned business to be up more than 50% and up more than 25% at SCP. Therefore, we foresee relighting several of our glass melting tanks sooner than planned.
 
"With increased volume and manufacturing capacity," he continued, "we should see considerable improvement in both the display segment's and the company's gross margins in the second quarter." He noted that up through the end of the first quarter, Corning used existing inventory to meet the increase in glass demand. The company expects second-quarter glass price declines at both its wholly owned business and SCP to be much more moderate compared to the first quarter.

The company has increased its estimate for the 2009 LCD glass market from 2 billion square feet to a range of 2.1 billion to 2.2 billion square feet. The change was driven by stronger-than-anticipated demand for LCD TVs, offset slightly by weaker-than-expected demand for notebook computers. The company now expects LCD TV units to grow 18% this year versus its original expectation of 9%.
 
Corning expects modest sequential growth in its other business segments in the second quarter. Also, Dow Corning has seen improving monthly sales which could lead to notably better results for its earnings.
 
Flaws reminded investors that the company is not providing specific sales or earnings guidance for the second quarter. "However," he said, "We expect to see significant sequential improvement in the company's sales, gross margin, and earnings before special items.* Second-quarter results will also benefit from our recently completed fixed cost reduction programs."
 
He pointed out that Corning acted decisively to resize the company's cost structure in line with $5 billion in sales this year. "As we said previously, if we do not see continued growth into the second half of this year, we will consider taking further corporate-wide restructuring actions to improve profitability."
 
In concluding his comments, Flaws said, "We are encouraged by the early market interest and growth opportunities for some of our recent product innovations. A good example is Gorilla glass, our durable glass for touch screen and electronic applications. Gorilla glass has already been designed into 20 different electronic devices including both cell phones and notebook computers from more than seven separate manufacturers. We believe Corning has the right product mix and is well positioned in core markets to seize the upside when economic growth returns."

Presentation of Information in this News Release
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP net income and EPS measures exclude restructuring, impairment and other charges and adjustments to prior estimates for such charges. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP measures exclude adjustments to asbestos settlement reserves, gains and losses arising from debt retirements, charges or credits arising from adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, equity method charges resulting from impairments of equity method investments or restructuring, impairment or other charges taken by equity method companies and gains from discontinued operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP net income and EPS measures is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled on the company's Web site at and accompany this news release.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
 
In the first quarter of 2009, Corning recorded a charge of $165 million ($107 million after-tax), which was comprised primarily of severance costs, special termination benefits and outplacement services for a corporate-wide restructuring plan.
 
 
On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against Corning and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) which might arise from PCC products or operations (the 2003 Plan). On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 Plan. On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization (the Amended PCC Plan) that resolved issues raised by the Court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 Plan.
 
As a result of progress in the parties' continuing negotiations, Corning believes the Amended PCC Plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and the probability that the 2003 plan will become effective has diminished. The proposed settlement under the Amended PCC Plan requires Corning to contribute its equity interest in PCC and Pittsburgh Corning Europe, N.V. (PCE) and to contribute a fixed series of cash payments, recorded at present value on December 31, 2008. Corning will have the option to contribute shares rather than cash, but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not number of shares. As a result, the estimated asbestos litigation liability is no longer impacted by movements in the value of Corning common stock. The Amended PCC Plan does not include non-PCC asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against Corning. Corning has recorded an additional amount for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability.
 
In the first quarter of 2009, we recorded charges of $4 million ($2 million after-tax) to adjust the asbestos litigation liability for the change in value of the components of the Amended PCC Plan.
 
 
In the first quarter of 2009, equity in earnings of affiliated companies included charges of $29 million ($27 million after-tax) for Corning's share of the restructuring charges at Dow Corning Corporation.
 
 
Weighted average shares outstanding are as follows (in millions):
