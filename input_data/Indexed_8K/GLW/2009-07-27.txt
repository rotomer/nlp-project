Corning Announces Second-Quarter Results
 
Company experiences substantial LCD volume growth
Q3 glass demand expected to remain strong
 
CORNING, N.Y. 
Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) today announced its results for the second quarter of 2009, as well as its expectations for the third quarter.
 
Second-Quarter Highlights
 
Quarter Two Financial Comparisons

These are non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided in the tables following this news release, as well as on the company's investor relations Web site.
 
"Global LCD television retail sales continue to be resilient during these challenging economic times," said Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer. "This gave confidence to the LCD supply chain to rebuild inventory during the second quarter."

Weeks noted that Corning initially met the increased second-quarter demand by working off its inventory supply, "but as demand continued to rise, we restarted some idled glass melting capacity to help meet the industry's increased appetite. We saw glass volume increase by 101% at our wholly owned business and by 50% at Samsung Corning Precision quarter-over-quarter," he said. "Additionally, we saw growth in our other businesses and improvement in equity earnings from Dow Corning Corporation in the second quarter."
 
Second-Quarter Segment Results
Sales in the Display Technologies segment were $673 million, an 89% increase sequentially. As expected, price declines in the second quarter were modest. Display sales were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate movements this quarter.
 
Telecommunications segment sales were $437 million, an increase of 14% over the previous quarter. Corning again experienced strong demand for optical fiber and cable in China. In North America, the company saw increased demand for its fiber-to-the-home products.
 
Environmental Technologies segment sales were $132 million, an increase of 20%, driven primarily by improved automotive product sales in Germany, China, and the U.S. The company said that U.S. automotive product demand was likely driven by a necessary replenishment of the supply chain during the quarter, rather than an increase in auto production. Government incentive programs contributed to the sales increases in Germany and China in the second quarter.
 
Specialty Materials segment sales were $71 million, up $11 million over the first quarter, due primarily to continued adoption of Gorilla glass by notebook and portable electronic device makers.
 
Corning's equity earnings were $361 million, a considerable increase over first-quarter equity earnings of $195 million. Equity earnings from Dow Corning Corporation were $58 million versus $5 million in the first quarter, which included $29 million for Corning's share of a restructuring charge at Dow Corning. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision were $294 million in the second quarter, compared to $187 million in the first quarter. Volume increased 50% over the previous quarter and sequential glass price declines were minor.
 
Looking Forward
"The resurgent demand for LCD glass is propelling us to restore much of our previously idled production capacity as quickly as possible to meet our customers' needs," said James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer. "Approximately 40% of our second-quarter shipments came from existing inventory. We need to- and have- restarted tanks to replace this inventory drawdown to meet third-quarter demand. We believe our third-quarter glass shipments will be flat to up slightly, compared to the very strong second-quarter level." Flaws reiterated that Corning expects third-quarter glass substrate prices to be even with those of the second quarter.

Flaws said that supply chain inventories at the end of the second quarter have been rebuilt to levels similar to the end of 2008, as the industry prepares for a seasonally stronger second half of the year. "We estimate that current inventory supplies are 16% less than the second quarter last year, compared to retail demand that has been running approximately 15% ahead of a year ago. Retail demand is forecasted to continue growing at double-digit rates in the back half of this year. This comparison gives us some comfort about the outlook for the remainder of the year. However, the pace of economic recovery remains uncertain and we are being cautious about the amount of capacity we are restarting for the fourth quarter and for early 2010. As we receive more clarity from our customers on their fourth-quarter outlook, we will make decisions on our fourth-quarter capacity levels."
 
"We have increased our forecast for LCD glass market volume in 2009 due to the vitality of LCD TV sales in the first half of the year. We now estimate that total yearly volume will be around 2.3 billion square feet, or about 15% growth over last year," he said. Corning originally expected annual glass volume to be 2 billion square feet and early last quarter revised it upward to a range of 2.1 billion to 2.2 billion square feet.
 
The company expects to see continued improvement in equity earnings from Dow Corning, noting that silicone orders have been improving month by month, and volumes at Hemlock Semiconductor, Dow Corning's consolidated subsidiary corporation, should remain strong.
 
"As we enter the second half of the year, we are seeing signs that the impact of the global recession on our businesses may be moderating. That said, questions pertaining to the pace of economic recovery remain. While we do not currently believe another corporate-wide downsizing will be necessary, we are looking at specific business unit restructuring needs," Flaws said. "We don't expect the global auto industry and U.S. truck market to rebound quickly. As a result, we are evaluating further cost reductions in our Environmental Technologies segment later this quarter, which may result in restructuring charges in the back half of the year."
 
"We are also working to align the level of the company's research, development, and engineering spending with our future revenue estimates in what may be a relatively slow economic recovery. As a result, restructuring charges in this area are also possible in the fourth quarter," Flaws noted.
 
Flaws added that the company expects its 2009 tax rate to be between zero and 3%. "Looking ahead to 2010, we feel that our tax rate could be around 10%. However, given unknowns in the rate of economic recovery and uncertainty regarding potential changes to the U.S. tax code, our 2010 rate could be significantly different," he said.
 
The company said 2009 capital expenditures are forecasted to be approximately $1.1 billion. In 2010, capital expenditures are expected to be around $600 million.

Flaws concluded, "LCD TVs have become the product of choice for consumers and the speed at which they are replacing CRT models is accelerating. This technology substitution is expected to fuel the LCD glass market for several years to come. Telecommunications carriers worldwide continue to invest in broadband network expansions, and we are seeing rapid acceptance of our Gorilla glass as a cover glass for many handheld and computer applications. These are promising signs that our businesses are poised for future growth."

Presentation of Information in this News Release
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP net income and EPS measures exclude restructuring, impairment and other charges and adjustments to prior estimates for such charges. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP measures exclude adjustments to asbestos settlement reserves, gains and losses arising from debt retirements, charges or credits arising from adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, equity method charges resulting from impairments of equity method investments or restructuring, impairment or other charges taken by equity method companies and gains from discontinued operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP net income and EPS measures is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found on the company's Web site by going to

and clicking Financial Reports on the left. Reconciliation also accompanies this news release.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
 
On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against Corning and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) which might arise from PCC products or operations (the 2003 Plan). On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 Plan. On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization (the Amended PCC Plan) that resolved issues raised by the Court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 Plan.
 
As a result of progress in the parties' continuing negotiations, Corning believes the Amended PCC Plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and the probability that the 2003 plan will become effective has diminished. The proposed settlement under the Amended PCC Plan requires Corning to contribute its equity interest in PCC and Pittsburgh Corning Europe, N.V. (PCE) and to contribute a fixed series of cash payments recorded at present value. Corning will have the option to contribute shares rather than cash, but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not number of shares. As a result, the estimated asbestos litigation liability is no longer impacted by movements in the value of Corning common stock. The Amended PCC Plan does not include non-PCC asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against Corning. Corning has recorded an additional amount for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability.
 
In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded charges of $5 million ($3 million after-tax) to adjust the asbestos litigation liability for the change in value of the components of the Amended PCC Plan.
