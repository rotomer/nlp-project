Corning Announces Third-Quarter Results

"The improvement we have seen over the past two quarters has increased our optimism for the fourth quarter," Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "Retail sales for LCD televisions remained strong throughout the third quarter, and we believe this will continue into the fourth quarter, which is typically the heaviest retail buying period. This demand has allowed the global LCD supply chain to maintain appropriate inventory levels," he said.
 
Third-Quarter Segment Results
Sales in the Display Technologies segment were $679 million and slightly higher than the second quarter. Third-quarter sales were impacted by an earthquake in Japan that affected production at the company's LCD facility in Shizuoka in August. Display sales were positively impacted by foreign exchange rate movements in the quarter.
 
In the third quarter, Corning began volume shipments of Gen 10 glass substrates from its newest LCD glass manufacturing plant in Sakai City, Japan. Corning is the first manufacturer of TFT-grade Gen 10 substrates in the world.
 
Telecommunications segment sales were $450 million, an increase of 3% over the previous quarter. The segment saw continued strength in optical fiber sales in China, as well as strong demand for private network products in North America. The growth rate was impacted by a slowing of fiber-to-the-home demand in North America.
 
Environmental Technologies segment sales were $167 million, an increase of 27% sequentially, driven primarily by automotive product sales increases in the United States, China, and Germany. Corning said the improved automotive product demand was likely the result of governmental incentives within these regions, including the now-ended U.S. "cash for clunkers" program, and diminished global inventory levels. The company also experienced strong demand for its heavy-duty diesel products due to manufacturers purchasing product ahead of new 2010 U.S. emissions regulations.
 
Specialty Materials segment sales were $90 million, a 27% increase over quarter two. The sales increase was due in part to the continued ramp up in demand for Gorilla glass used in notebooks and portable electronic devices. Corning's Gorilla glass is now used by 12 major brands and designed into more than 45 devices.
 
Life Science segment sales were $92 million, compared to $81 million in the second quarter. Third-quarter sales included $7 million from Axygen Bioscience, Inc., which was recently acquired by Corning. Axygen's product portfolio and established distribution network will significantly strengthen Corning's life sciences platform.
 
Corning's equity earnings were $418 million and significantly higher than second-quarter equity earnings of $361 million. Equity earnings from Dow Corning Corporation were $92 million, an increase of 59% over the second quarter. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision were $316 million, an increase of 7% sequentially.

Looking Forward  Quarter Four
"Although a portion of our glass production at the Taichung facility has been impacted by a power disruption, we remain confident that the strong performance in our display business over the last two quarters will continue in the fourth quarter of this year," James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said. "At the same time, we expect to see normal seasonal declines in our Telecommunications and Environmental Technologies businesses." He added that Corning expects equity earnings at Dow Corning to be higher compared to last quarter.
 
Corning expects glass volume in its wholly owned display business to be flat to down slightly sequentially this quarter. At SCP, glass volume is expected to be consistent quarter to quarter. The company also anticipates glass pricing at both its wholly owned business and SCP to be consistent with the third quarter. Flaws noted that without the temporary loss of glass production from Taichung, Corning had expected a quarter-over-quarter volume increase of approximately 5%.
 
"In our Display segment, global retailers are expected to offer attractive pricing for LCD televisions, which is likely to result in continuing robust demand through the fourth quarter. This retail demand, along with our expectation that panel manufacturers may lower utilization rates later this quarter, should allow the industry to maintain healthy inventory levels and alleviate any over-supply concerns," Flaws said.
 
The company anticipates its Telecommunications segment sales to be down 15%, due primarily to seasonally lower demand in North America. The company believes demand in China will remain strong.
 
Environmental Technologies segment sales are expected to be down between 10% and 15% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonal declines plus the expected drop in demand following the end of the U.S. incentive program.
 
Specialty Materials segment sales are expected to be similar to the third quarter or down 5% and Life Sciences segment sales are expected to be up 25%, driven by the Axygen acquisition.
 
Early Look at 2010
The company anticipates that worldwide unit sales of LCD televisions next year could reach 156 million, a 20% increase over 2009. Additionally, computer notebook sales are forecasted to grow by about 20%, while desktop monitor sales are expected to increase about 4% for the year. "If these retail forecasts are correct and glass supply chain inventories remain manageable, as we expect, then next year could see very robust gains in worldwide glass volume," Flaws said.
 
This demand is expected to result in a worldwide glass market of at least 2.7 billion square feet in 2010, an annual increase of approximately 15%. "We believe the amount of glass capacity that is currently being restarted by the industry is in line to meet these end market demand expectations," Flaws remarked.

The company stated glass demand will likely vary quarter to quarter next year. "We believe panel makers may respond to the seasonal decline in demand by reducing utilization rates in the first quarter. As a result, we would also expect first-quarter glass demand to be sequentially lower. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we would expect utilization rates at the panel makers to snap back as the supply chain expands to meet the seasonally stronger second half. In this environment, we would expect second-quarter glass demand to also increase significantly," Flaws said.

Presentation of Information in this News Release
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP net income and EPS measures exclude restructuring, impairment and other charges and adjustments to prior estimates for such charges. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP measures exclude adjustments to asbestos settlement reserves, gains and losses arising from debt retirements, charges or credits arising from adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, equity method charges resulting from impairments of equity method investments or restructuring, impairment or other charges taken by equity method companies and gains from discontinued operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP net income and EPS measures is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found on the company's Web site by going to

and clicking Financial Reports on the left. Reconciliation also accompanies this news release.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
 
In the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a charge of $10 million ($7 million after-tax) which was comprised of severance costs for a restructuring plan in the Environmental Technologies segment and asset disposal costs in other segments.
 
 
On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against Corning and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) which might arise from PCC products or operations (the 2003 Plan). On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 Plan. On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization (the Amended PCC Plan) that resolved issues raised by the Court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 Plan.
 
As a result of progress in the parties' continuing negotiations, Corning believes the Amended PCC Plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and the probability that the 2003 plan will become effective has diminished. The proposed settlement under the Amended PCC Plan requires Corning to contribute its equity interest in PCC and Pittsburgh Corning Europe, N.V. (PCE) and to contribute a fixed series of cash payments recorded at present value. Corning will have the option to contribute shares rather than cash, but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not number of shares. As a result, the estimated asbestos litigation liability is no longer impacted by movements in the value of Corning common stock. The Amended PCC Plan does not include non-PCC asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against Corning. Corning has recorded an additional amount for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability.
 
In the third quarter of 2009, we recorded charges of $6 million ($4 million after-tax) to adjust the asbestos litigation liability for the change in value of the components of the Amended PCC Plan.
