"
We began 2009 with a high degree of uncertainty and were not surprised with the slow start we saw in quarter one. Momentum picked up in the second quarter and our performance improved each quarter thereafter," Wendell P. Weeks, chairman and chief executive officer, said. "The second half of the year was particularly strong for LCD glass demand as consumers continued purchasing LCD televisions, laptop computers, and other electronic devices that use our glass. In addition, we saw a resurgence in demand for Corning's emissions control products as the auto industry rebuilt supply. We were pleased by the continued strength of telecom sales in China throughout the year. The growing popularity of Corning Gorilla glass as a protective covering for handheld electronic devices was much better than we expected, and our equity investments contributed strong earnings this past year.
 
"With our solid 2009 performance, we exceeded our $5 billion sales target, achieved very strong free cash flow* results, and maintained a strong balance sheet. We improved our competitive position with the introduction of several new products, such as our industry-leading Gen 10 LCD glass, ClearCurve multimode fiber and
 
LANscape Pretium EDGE solution for improved data center performance, advanced DuraTrap AC product for heavy-duty diesel filters, and new IT applications for Corning Gorilla glass. I believe Corning is a financially stronger and better positioned company now than a year ago," Weeks said.

Fourth-Quarter Segment Results
Sales in the Display Technologies segment were $717 million, increasing 6% sequentially and 84% year over year. The sequential increase was driven by continued robust retail demand for LCD products and panel makers' outlook for 2010. The year-over-year gain also reflects these factors but was amplified in comparison to a weak fourth quarter in 2008 when the supply chain was shrinking inventories. Sales also benefited from favorable foreign exchange rates. Sequential glass prices for the quarter were flat and volume increased moderately.
 
Telecommunications segment sales were $405 million, down 10% sequentially and similar to the fourth quarter of 2008. An expected slowdown in fiber-to-the-home sales and normal seasonal declines in North America contributed to the lower quarterly sales. This was partially offset by continued strong demand for private network products in North America and optical fiber sales in China.
 
Environmental Technologies segment sales were $181 million, an increase of 8% sequentially and 41% versus last year. The increase was driven by strong demand for automotive emissions control products as the industry rebuilds its inventory. Diesel sales improved slightly in Corning's light-duty diesel business.
 
Specialty Materials segment sales were $110 million, an increase of 22% sequentially and 31% from a year ago. The increase is reflected by improvements in the segment's advanced optics product sales and continued expansion of Corning Gorilla glass sales. Corning Gorilla glass is now being used by more than 15 major brands and is designed into more than 65 devices.
 
Life Sciences segment sales were $117 million, compared to $92 million in the third quarter and $75 million a year ago. The sales increases were 27% sequentially and 56% year over year. Fourth-quarter results reflect the first full-quarter reporting of Axygen Bioscience, Inc.'s sales of $36 million.
 
Corning's equity earnings were $461 million compared to $418 million in the previous quarter and $288 million a year ago. These represent 10% sequential and 60% year-over-year gains. Equity earnings from Dow Corning Corporation were $133 million, including special gains of $29 million attributed primarily to tax credits. These earnings represent a sequential gain of 45% and a year-over-year increase of 55%. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision were $318 million, a slight increase sequentially and 67% increase year over year.
 
Looking Forward
"Our economic assumptions for 2010 include a mild recovery in the developed world economies and continued growth in China. Clearly we don't have a crystal ball that can guarantee this outlook will come true, so we will be cautious on spending and prepared to be nimble if we see changes," James B. Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said.
 
"We expect the overall display glass market to be up in the first quarter versus our original expectation of lower seasonal demand," he said. "And, we believe the supply chain will need to continue to expand to support another year of good retail growth for LCD products."

The company's wholly owned business is expected to see a quarterly volume increase of 8% to 12% sequentially, while SCP sequential volume should be flat to up slightly in the first quarter. Corning expects moderate price declines in the quarter at its wholly owned business and SCP.
 
The company anticipates its first-quarter Telecommunications business segment sequential sales to be down 10% to 15% due to lower private network and fiber demand in China.
 
Environmental Technologies segment sequential sales are expected to remain strong at least through the first half of the quarter but may decline for the full quarter as the rebuild of auto inventories nears completion.
 
Specialty Materials segment sales are anticipated to be down 10% to 15% sequentially due to lower advanced optics sales. Corning Gorilla glass sales are expected to be up in quarter one.
 
In the Life Sciences segment sequential sales are expected to be comparable or up 5% for the quarter.
 
Equity earnings from Dow Corning in the first quarter are expected to be down about 20% driven by seasonally lower sales in Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation.
 
Flaws concluded by noting, "We were delighted with our fourth-quarter performance. This gives us strong momentum heading into 2010."

Presentation of Information in this News Release
Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning's non-GAAP net income and EPS measures exclude restructuring, impairment and other charges and adjustments to prior estimates for such charges. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP measures exclude adjustments to asbestos settlement reserves, gains and losses arising from debt retirements, charges or credits arising from adjustments to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, equity method charges resulting from impairments of equity method investments or restructuring, impairment or other charges taken by equity method companies and gains from discontinued operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP net income and EPS measures is helpful to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company's underlying performance. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found on the company's Web site by going to

and clicking Financial Reports on the left. Reconciliation also accompanies this news release.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a charge of $53 million ($38 million after-tax) as part of the Company's corporate-wide restructuring plan in response to lower sales in 2009.
 
 
On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against Corning and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) which might arise from PCC products or operations (the 2003 Plan). On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 Plan. On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an amended plan of reorganization (the Amended PCC Plan) that resolved issues raised by the Court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 Plan.
 
As a result of progress in the parties' continuing negotiations, Corning believes the Amended PCC Plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and the probability that the 2003 plan will become effective has diminished. The proposed settlement under the Amended PCC Plan requires Corning to contribute its equity interest in PCC and Pittsburgh Corning Europe, N.V. (PCE) and to contribute a fixed series of cash payments recorded at present value. Corning will have the option to contribute shares rather than cash, but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not number of shares. As a result, the estimated asbestos litigation liability is no longer impacted by movements in the value of Corning common stock. The Amended PCC Plan does not include non-PCC asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against Corning. Corning has recorded an additional amount for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded charges of $5 million ($3 million after-tax) to adjust the asbestos litigation liability for the change in value of the components of the Amended PCC Plan.
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2009, equity in earnings of affiliated companies included a credit of $29 million ($27 million after-tax) primarily for Corning's share of excess foreign tax credits from foreign dividends at Dow Corning Corporation.
 
 
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a $58 million tax benefit which included the following items: a $27 million U.S. tax credit for research and experimentation expenses; a $41 million tax benefit to reflect a deferred tax asset associated with a non-taxable Medicare subsidy; and a $10 million valuation allowance due to a change in judgment about the realizability of U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets in future years.
