Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 3, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors adopted corporate performance metrics for the 2010 cash performance units awarded under the Companys 2005 Employee Equity Participation Program, as amended. Approximately 190 employees, including executive officers, participate. The equally weighted corporate performance metrics for the 2010 cash performance units are adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating cash flow of the Company in 2010, and actual award opportunity can range from 0% to 150% of the target award based on actual performance against goals. For all participants, including Messrs. Wendell Weeks, Peter Volanakis, James Flaws, Kirk Gregg and Joseph Miller, cash performance units earned, unearned, or forfeited based upon 2010 corporate performance will continue to have restrictions on transfer and the possibility of forfeiture until February 1, 2013. For these cash performance units awards, the number of units earned will be determine d by the Compensation Committee in February 2011 based on actual 2010 corporate financial results compared to the corporate performance metrics. For 2009, performance share units were used instead of cash performance units. At its recent meeting, the Compensation Committee also established corporate performance metrics for 2010 Variable Compensation (payable in 2011) under the Corporations Performance Plan and Goalsharing Plans that were consistent with last year. The Variable Compensation Plan is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 2 of Cornings Proxy Statement, Definitive 14A filed March 8, 2006.
