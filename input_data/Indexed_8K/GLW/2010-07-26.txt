Effective on July 23, 2010, Corning Incorporated filed a Certificate of Change to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the New York State Secretary of State. That Certificate of Change designated Corporation Service Company, 80 State Street, Albany, NY 12207-2543 as registered agent upon whom process against Corning Incorporated may be served. The Corning Board of Directors approved that change at its July 21, 2010 meeting.
The July 23, 2010 Certificate of Change amends part of Section 8 of Corning's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which previously had provided "that the address within the State to which the Secretary of State shall mail a copy of process in any action or proceeding against the Corporation which may be served upon him is One Riverfront Plaza, Corning, New York 14831, Attention of the Secretary."
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
