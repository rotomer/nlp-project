Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) announced today the reference yield and total consideration for each series of notes subject to its previously announced cash tender offer. The reference yields were determined at 2:00 p.m. New York City time today. The total consideration for each series of notes is based on the applicable reference yield plus a fixed spread, in each case as set forth in the table below, and is payable to holders of notes subject to the tender offer who validly tender and do not validly withdraw their notes before the early tender date, which is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, today, unless extended. All payments for notes purchased in the tender offer will also include accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount tendered up to, but not including, the tender offer settlement date, which is currently expected to be Wednesday, September 1, 2010.
CORNING, N.Y. 
 
 
Tendered notes will be accepted in the order of the acceptance priority levels set forth in the table above, except that the aggregate principal amount of 5.9% notes that will be accepted will not exceed the 5.9% note cap. Under certain circumstances, Corning will accept tendered notes of one or more of the series on a pro rata basis as further described in the Offer to Purchase.
The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on August 30, 2010, unless extended. Holders of notes subject to the tender offer must validly tender and not validly withdraw their notes before the early tender date, which is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, today, unless extended, to be eligible to receive the total consideration, which includes an early tender premium of $50.00 per $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered by such holders that are
accepted for purchase. Holders of notes subject to the tender offer who validly tender their notes after the early tender date will receive the tender consideration, which is the total consideration minus $50 per $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered by such holders that are accepted for purchase. Holders of notes subject to the tender offer who tender their notes before the early tender date may not withdraw their notes after the early tender date, unless otherwise required by law. Holders of notes subject to the tender offer who tender their notes after the early tender date may not withdraw their notes, unless otherwise required by law.

The tender offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase. The condition that Corning consummate financing arrangements prior to the expiration date as described in the Offer to Purchase has been satisfied by Corning's completion of its previously announced note offering.
Corning has retained Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. to serve as dealer managers for the tender offer and has retained Global Bondholder Services Corporation to serve as depositary and information agent for the tender offer.
