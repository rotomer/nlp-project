On August 31, 2010, Corning Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the expiration and results of its previously announced cash tender offer for certain notes (the "Tender Offer"). The press release is filed as exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
  Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) announced today the expiration, as of 11:59 p.m. New York City time, on Monday, Aug. 30, 2010, of its previously announced cash tender offer relating to a combined aggregate principal amount of $225,000,000 of its notes. According to information provided by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the depositary for the tender offer, $266,399,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes subject to the cash tender offer were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn before 5 p.m. New York City time on Monday, Aug. 16, 2010, the early tender date for the tender offer, and a total of $266,859,000 aggregate principal amount of notes subject to the tender offer were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn before the expiration date for the tender offer, as more fully set forth below.
CORNING, N.Y., August 31, 2010
 
 
The $266,859,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes subject to the tender offer that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn before the expiration date of the tender offer exceeds the combined maximum tender amount of $225,000,000, and the $112,935,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 5.9% Notes due 2014 that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn before the expiration date of the tender offer exceeds $100,000,000, the maximum principal amount of the 5.9% Notes due 2014 that Corning will purchase in the tender offer. In lieu of accepting 6.2% Notes due 2016 on a prorated basis, Corning has increased the aggregate principal amount of notes that it will accept in the tender offer to $226,352,000 without increasing the maximum principal amount of 5.9% Notes due 2014 that it will accept. This increase did not require an extension of the term of the tender offer under applicable federal securities laws because the additional amount of 6.2% Notes due 2016 that were accepted represents less than 2% of such notes outstanding.
Based on the amounts of tendered notes, the increased size of the tender offer, and the acceptance priority levels set forth above, Corning has accepted for purchase $100,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.9% Notes due 2014 validly tendered and not validly withdrawn (acceptance priority level one), $126,352,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.2% Notes due 2016 validly tendered and not validly withdrawn (acceptance priority level two), and no 8.875% Debentures due 2016 validly tendered and not validly withdrawn (acceptance priority level three). The 5.9% Notes due 2014 accepted for purchase have been prorated by a proration factor of approximately 88.61% in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase dated Aug. 3, 2010, but the 6.2% Notes due 2016 accepted for purchase have not been prorated.
Corning expects to make payment for all notes accepted for purchase, including payment of accrued but unpaid interest on the purchased notes, in same-day funds on Wednesday, Sept. 1, 2010.
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. served as dealer managers for the tender offer, and Global Bondholder Services Corporation served as depositary and information agent for the tender offer.
