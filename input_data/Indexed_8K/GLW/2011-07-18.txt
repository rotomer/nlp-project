("Hebei Dongxu") for misappropriation of certain trade secrets related to the fusion draw process for manufacturing glass substrates used in active matrix liquid crystal displays ("LCDs"). On July 18, 2011, in Korea, Corning Incorporated and Samsung Corning Precision Materials Co., Ltd. ("SCP") filed suits in the Daejeon District Court against Hebei Dongxu, one of its officers, and two other named individuals, for related trade secret misappropriation.
