Item 8.01 Other Events.
In March of 2012, Corning Incorporated ("Company") received a grand jury subpoena issued in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan from the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with an investigation into conduct relating to possible antitrust law violations involving certain automotive products, including catalytic converters, diesel particulate filters, substrates and monoliths. The subpoena requires that the Company produce certain documents located within the United States to the Department of Justice. Antitrust investigations can result in significant penalties being imposed by the antitrust authorities. The Companys policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws. Currently the Company can not estimate the ultimate financial impact, if any, resulting from the investigation. Such potential impact, if an antitrust violation by the Company is found, could however, be material to the results of operations of the Company in a particular period.
