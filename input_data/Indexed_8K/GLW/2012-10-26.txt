FOR RELEASE  OCTOBER 26, 2012
Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) announced today that it has commenced a cash tender offer for up to $75 million aggregate principal amount of specified series of its outstanding debt. The terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in an Offer to Purchase dated today. The Company will also redeem $174 million in outstanding debentures.
CORNING, N.Y. 
In the tender offer, the Company is offering to purchase, under certain conditions and subject to certain limits, its 8.875% Debentures due 2021, 8.875% Debentures due 2016 and 6.75% Debentures due 2013 (collectively, the "debentures"), as summarized in the table below:
 
 
Tendered debentures will be accepted in the order of the Acceptance Priority Levels set forth in the table above, up to an aggregate principal amount of $75,000,000.

The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on November 26, 2012, unless extended. Holders of debentures subject to the tender offer must validly tender and not validly withdraw their debentures before the Early Tender Date, which is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 8, 2012, unless extended, to be eligible to receive the total consideration as described below. Holders of debentures subject to the tender offer who validly tender their debentures after the Early Tender Date and prior to the expiration date will be eligible to receive the tender consideration, which is the total consideration described below minus the Early Tender Premium applicable to that series of debentures. Holders of debentures subject to the tender offer who tender their debentures before the Early Tender Date may not withdraw their debentures after the Early Tender Date. Holders of debentures subject to the tender offer who tender their debentures after the Early Tender Date may not withdraw their debentures, unless otherwise provided by the Company or as required by law.
The total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of debentures tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase, dated October 26, 2012, by reference to a fixed spread specified in the table above for each series of the debentures over the yield based on the bid side price of the Reference U.S. Treasury Security specified in the table above, as calculated by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 8, 2012. In addition to the total consideration or the tender consideration, as applicable, accrued interest up to, but not including, the settlement date will be paid in cash on all validly tendered debentures accepted in the tender offer. The settlement date will follow promptly the expiration date and currently is expected to be November 27, 2012.
The tender offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including, among other things, the consummation by the Company, no later than the expiration date, of financing arrangements satisfactory to it as described in the Offer to Purchase.
Corning has retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to serve as Dealer Manager for the tender offer and has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to serve as information agent and tender agent for the tender offer.

King & Co., Inc. by telephone at (212) 269-5550 or (800) 967-4607 or in writing at 48 Wall Street, 22nd Floor, New York, NY 10005. Questions regarding the tender offer may be directed to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at (866) 834-4666 (toll free) or (212) 834-4811 (collect).

In any jurisdiction where the laws require the tender offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the tender offer will be deemed made on behalf of Corning Incorporated by J.P Morgan Securities LLC, or one or more registered brokers or dealers under the laws of such jurisdiction.
