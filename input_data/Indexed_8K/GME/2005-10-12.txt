Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. Credit Agreement On October 11, 2005, GameStop Corp. (f/k/a GSC Holdings Corp.) ("GameStop"), together with certain of GameStop's subsidiaries (the "Borrowers"), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. and the other lending institutions listed in the Agreement (the "Lenders"), Bank of America, N.A. and Citicorp North America, Inc., as Issuing Banks, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, Citicorp North America, Inc., as Syndication Agent, and Merrill Lynch Capital, a division of Merrill Lynch Business Financial Services Inc., as Documentation Agent. The Agreement replaces the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 21, 2004 (the "Prior Facility"). The Prior Facility was due to expire in June 2009. Letters of Credit issued under a Loan and Security Agreement, dated March 16, 1998, among Electronics Boutique of America, Inc., Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. ("EB"), EB Investment Corp. and Fleet Retail Group (as amended from time to time) (the "EB Credit Facility"), which totaled approximately $3.6 million as of October 11, 2005, were transferred to the Agreement. The EB Credit Facility was terminated concurrently with entering into the Agreement. The Agreement provides for a maximum borrowing of $400,000,000 and terminates on October 11, 2010. Borrowings under the Agreement will be limited by a borrowing base, which is defined as the lesser of (i) the cost of eligible inventory multiplied by the inventory advance rate (with initial rate of 71% for GameStop inventory and 70% for EB inventory) or (ii) 90% of the net appraised inventory liquidation value, plus, in each case, 85% of eligible credit card receivables, less certain reserves. The maximum borrowing amount may be reduced from time to time according to the terms of the Agreement. Borrowings made pursuant to the Agreement may be committed loans or swing line loans, the combined sum (including any outstanding letters of credit) of which may not exceed the lesser of the maximum borrowing amount or the borrowing base. Amounts borrowed under the Agreement may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until October 11, 2010. The Agreement also provides for the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings made pursuant to the Agreement will bear interest, payable quarterly or, if earlier, at the end of any interest period, at either (a) the prime loan rate, described in the Agreement as the higher of Bank of America N.A.'s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, plus a percentage spread (ranging from 0% to 0.25%) based on GameStop's consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurodollar rate (a publicly published rate) plus a percentage spread (ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%) based on GameStop's consolidated leverage ratio. Swing line loans shall be prime rate loans. Under the Agreement, GameStop agrees to pay a commitment fee, payable quarterly, at rates that range from 0.375% to 0.50% depending on GameStop's consolidated leverage ratio. The payments under this Agreement are guaranteed by the direct or indirect domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries of GameStop. The Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on GameStop and its subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, change of business and transactions with affiliates. The covenants permit GameStop to use proceeds of the credit loans and letters of credit for the repayment of all amounts under the Prior Facility and for other existing 2 indebtedness, as permitted under the Agreement, for working capital, capital expenditures and to pay transaction costs in connection with the Mergers (as defined in item 2.01 below) and for all other lawful corporate purposes, including payment of dividends, acquisitions of assets, capital stock of other companies and share repurchases, in each case to the extent permitted in the Agreement. The Agreement also contains a financial covenant that requires GameStop, upon the credit extensions outstanding under the Agreement exceeding 80% of the lesser (x) the maximum borrowing amount or (y) the borrowing base, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.5:1.0. The Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any material representation or warranty made by GameStop proving to be false in any material respect, certain bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership events affecting GameStop or its subsidiaries, defaults relating to certain other indebtedness, imposition of certain judgments and mergers or the liquidation of GameStop. In the event of a default by GameStop, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of Lenders shall, declare all obligations under the Agreement immediately due and payable, terminate the Lenders' commitments to make loans under the Agreement, and enforce any and all rights of the Lenders or Administrative Agent under the Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency and receivership, the commitments of Lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of GameStop will become immediately due and payable. The foregoing description of the Agreement and related matters is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

(b) The Administrative Agent may hereafter, on five (5) Business Days written notice to the Lead Borrower, establish additional Reserves or change any of the foregoing Reserves, in the exercise of the Permitted Discretion of the Administrative Agent; provided, however, that as long as no Event of Default is then exists and is continuing, in no event shall the Administrative Agent establish new Reserves in any thirty day period in an aggregate amount in excess of ten percent (10%) of the Borrowing Base (as set forth in the most recent Borrowing Base Certificate delivered to the Administrative Agent under Section 5.1(e) of this Agreement); and provided further that the Administrative Agent shall not modify the methodology in which Reserves described in Section 2.2(a) hereof are determined from time to time. 2.3 Making of Loans. (a) Except as set forth in Sections 2.16 and 2.24, Loans (other than Swingline Loans) by the Lenders shall be either Prime Rate Loans or LIBO Loans as the Lead Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers may request subject to and in accordance with this Section 2.3, provided that all Swingline Loans shall be only Prime Rate Loans. All Loans made pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, be Loans of the same Type. Each Lender may fulfill its Commitment with respect to any Loan by causing any lending office of such Lender to make such Loan; but any such use of a lending office shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of the applicable Note. Each Lender shall, subject to its overall policy considerations, use reasonable efforts (but shall not be obligated) to select a lending office which will not result in the payment of increased costs by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.23. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.3 and the provisions of Section 2.24, Borrowings of Loans of more than one Type may be incurred at the same time, but no more than twenty (20) Borrowings of LIBO Loans may be outstanding at any time. (b) The Lead Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent three (3) Business Days' prior telephonic notice (thereafter confirmed in writing) of each LIBO Borrowing and one (1) Business Day's prior notice of each Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans. Any such notice, to be effective, must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the third Business Day in the case of LIBO Loans prior to, and on the first Business Day in the case of Prime Rate Loans prior to, the date on which such Borrowing is to be made. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the amount of the proposed Borrowing (which shall be in an integral multiple of $100,000, but not less than $1,000,000 in the case of LIBO Loans) and the date thereof (which shall be a Business Day) and shall contain disbursement instructions. Such notice shall specify whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Borrowing of Prime 35 Rate Loans or LIBO Loans and, if LIBO Loans, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no election of Interest Period is specified in any such notice for a Borrowing of LIBO Loans, such notice shall be deemed a request for an Interest Period of one month. If no election is made as to the Type of Loan, such notice shall be deemed a request for a Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of its proportionate share of such Borrowing, the date of such Borrowing, the Type of Borrowing being requested and the Interest Period or Interest Periods applicable thereto, as appropriate. On the borrowing date specified in such notice, each Lender shall make its share of the Borrowing available at the office of the Administrative Agent at 40 Broad Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, no later than 12:00 noon, New York time, in immediately available funds. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to Prime Rate Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Upon receipt of the funds made available by the Lenders to fund any Borrowing hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall disburse such funds in the manner specified in the notice of borrowing delivered by the Lead Borrower and shall use reasonable efforts to make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrowers no later than 3:00 p.m., New York time. (c) The Administrative Agent, without the request of the Lead Borrower, may advance any interest, fee, service charge, or other payment to which any Agent or their Affiliates or any Lender is entitled from any Borrower pursuant hereto or any other Loan Document and may charge the same to the Loan Account notwithstanding that an Overadvance may result thereby. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lead Borrower of any such advance or charge no later than one Business Day prior to the making thereof. Such action on the part of the Administrative Agent shall not constitute a waiver of the Administrative Agent's rights and each Borrower's obligations under Section 2.3(a). Any amount which is added to the principal balance of the Loan Account as provided in this Section 2.3(c) shall bear interest at the interest rate then and thereafter applicable to Prime Rate Loans. 36 2.4 Overadvances. The Agents and the Lenders have no obligation to make any Loan or to provide any Letter of Credit if an Overadvance would result. The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, make Permitted Overadvances without the consent of the Lenders and each Lender shall be bound thereby. Any Permitted Overadvances may constitute Swingline Loans. The making of any Permitted Overadvance is for the benefit of the Borrowers; such Permitted Overadvances constitute Revolving Loans and Obligations. The making of any such Permitted Overadvances on any one occasion shall not obligate the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make or permit any Permitted Overadvances on any other occasion or to permit such Permitted Overadvances to remain outstanding. 2.5 Swingline Loans. (a) The Swingline Lender is authorized by the Lenders and shall, subject to the provisions of this Section, make Swingline Loans up to $15,000,000 in the aggregate outstanding at any time consisting only of Prime Rate Loans, upon a notice of Borrowing received by the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender (which notice, at the Swingline Lender's discretion, may be submitted prior to 1:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day on which such Swingline Loan is requested). Swingline Loans shall be subject to periodic settlement with the Lenders under Section 2.7 below. (b) Swingline Loans may be made only in the following circumstances: (A) for administrative convenience, the Swingline Lender shall, at the Lead Borrower's request, make Swingline Loans in reliance upon the Borrowers' actual or deemed representations under Section 4.2, that the applicable conditions for borrowing are satisfied or (B) for Permitted Overadvances. If the conditions for borrowing under Section 4.2 cannot be fulfilled, the Lead Borrower shall give immediate notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender (a "Noncompliance Notice"), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly provide each Lender with a copy of the Noncompliance Notice. If the conditions for borrowing under Section 4.2 cannot be fulfilled, the Required Lenders may direct the Swingline Lender to, and the Swingline Lender thereupon shall, cease making Swingline Loans (other than Permitted Overadvances) until such conditions can be satisfied or are waived in accordance with Section 9.2. Unless the Required Lenders so direct the Swingline Lender, the Swingline Lender may, but is not obligated to, continue to make Swingline Loans beginning one Business Day after the Non-Compliance Notice is furnished to the Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Swingline Loans shall be made pursuant to this subsection (b) (other than Permitted Overadvances) if the aggregate outstanding amount of the Credit Extensions would exceed the lower of (i)(x) $400,000,000, or (y) such lesser amount to which the Total Commitments have then been decreased by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.15 hereof, or (ii) the then amount of the Borrowing Base. 37 2.6 Letters of Credit. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, the Lead Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers, may request an Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time after the date hereof and prior to the Termination Date, to issue, and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, such Issuing Bank shall issue, for the account of the relevant Borrower, one or more Letters of Credit; provided that no Letter of Credit shall be issued if after giving effect to such issuance (i) the aggregate Letter of Credit Outstandings shall exceed $50,000,000, or (ii) the aggregate Credit Extensions would exceed the limitation set forth in Section 2.1(a)(i); and provided, further, that no Letter of Credit shall be issued if such Issuing Bank shall have received notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders that the conditions to such issuance have not been met. (b) Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date, provided that each Letter of Credit may, upon the request of the Lead Borrower, include a provision whereby such Letter of Credit shall be renewed automatically for additional consecutive periods of twelve (12) months or less (but not beyond the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date) unless the Issuing Bank which issued such Letter of Credit notifies the beneficiary thereof at least thirty (30) days prior to the then-applicable expiration date that such Letter of Credit will not be renewed. (c) Drafts drawn under any Letter of Credit shall be reimbursed by the Borrowers in dollars on the same Business Day of any such payment thereof by the applicable Issuing Bank by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such drawing (together with interest as provided in Section 2.6(e)) not later than 12:00 noon, New York time, on (i) the date that the Lead Borrower shall have received notice of such drawing, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York time, on such date, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Lead Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received after 10:00 a.m., New York time on the day of drawing, provided that the Lead Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.3 that such payment be financed with a Revolving Loan consisting of a Prime Rate Loan, or a Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers' obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Prime Rate Loan or Swingline Loan. Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make payment thereunder (which payment shall not 38 be made until two (2) Business Days after such notice from such Issuing Bank to the Borrower), provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrowers of their obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such payment. (d) If an Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement, then, unless the Borrowers shall reimburse such Issuing Bank in full on the date such payment is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such payment is made to but excluding the date that the Borrowers reimburse such Issuing Bank therefor, at the rate per annum then applicable to Prime Rate Loans, provided that if the Borrowers fail to reimburse such Issuing Bank when due pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, then Section 2.10 shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. (e) Immediately upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit by an Issuing Bank (or the amendment of a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof), and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold to each Lender, and each such Lender shall be deemed unconditionally and irrevocably to have purchased from such Issuing Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such Lender's Commitment Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each drawing thereunder and the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect thereto. Upon any change in the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.15, and/or 9.5, it is hereby agreed that with respect to all Letter of Credit Outstandings, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations hereby created to reflect the new Commitment Percentages of the assigning and assignee Lenders. Any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Bank under or in connection with a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, shall not create for such Issuing Bank any resulting liability to any Lender. (f) In the event that an Issuing Bank makes any L/C Disbursement and the Borrowers shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to such Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.6(c), such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each Lender of such failure, and each Lender shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in dollars and in same day funds. If an Issuing Bank so notifies the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent so notifies the Lenders prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, on any Business Day, each such Lender shall make available to such Issuing Bank such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the amount of such 39 payment on such Business Day in same day funds (or if such notice is received by the Lenders after 11:00 a.m., New York time on the day of receipt, payment shall be made on the immediately following Business Day). If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made its Commitment Percentage of the amount of such payment available to such Issuing Bank, such Lender agrees to pay to such Issuing Bank, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. Each Lender agrees to fund its Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed payment notwithstanding a failure to satisfy any applicable lending conditions or the provisions of Sections 2 or 2.6, or the occurrence of the Termination Date. The failure of any Lender to make available to an Issuing Bank its Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall neither relieve any Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to such Issuing Bank its Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, nor increase the obligation of such other Lender. Whenever any Lender has made payments to an Issuing Bank in respect of any reimbursement obligation for any Letter of Credit, such Lender shall be entitled to share ratably, based on its Commitment Percentage, in all payments and collections thereafter received on account of such reimbursement obligation. (g) Whenever any Borrower desires that an Issuing Bank issue a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Lead Borrower shall give to such Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent at least two (2) Business Days' prior written (including telegraphic, telex, facsimile or cable communication) notice (or such shorter period as may be agreed upon in writing by such Issuing Bank and Borrower) specifying the date on which the proposed Letter of Credit is to be issued, amended, renewed or extended (which shall be a Business Day), the stated amount of the Letter of Credit so requested, the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof, and the provisions thereof. If requested by an Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower shall also submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of Credit. (h) The obligations of the Borrowers to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any L/C Disbursement shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit; (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which the Borrowers may have at any time against a beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or against any Issuing Bank or any of the Lenders, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any 40 respect; (iv) payment by any Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers' obligations hereunder; or (vi) the fact that any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or any of their Affiliates shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing Bank, provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) suffered by the Borrowers that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. (i) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Lead Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrowers shall deposit in the Cash Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105% of the Letter of Credit Outstandings as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Each such deposit shall be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such Cash Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Collateral Agent at the request of the Lead Borrower and at the Borrowers' risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if 41 any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such Cash Collateral Account shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to reimburse an Issuing Bank for payments on account of drawings under Letters of Credit for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time or, if the Loans have matured or the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other Obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. (j) The Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree that the Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed Letters of Credit hereunder as if issued by an Issuing Bank. 2.7 Settlements Amongst Lenders. (a) The Swingline Lender may (but shall not be obligated to), at any time, on behalf of the Borrowers (which hereby authorize the Swingline Lender to act in their behalf in that regard) request the Administrative Agent to cause the Lenders to make a Revolving Loan (which shall be a Prime Rate Loan) in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the outstanding amount of Swingline Loans made in accordance with Section 2.5, which request may be made regardless of whether the conditions set forth in Section 4 have been satisfied. Upon such request, each Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of such Revolving Loan for the account of the Swingline Lender. If the Swingline Lender requires a Revolving Loan to be made by the Lenders and the request therefor is received prior to 12:00 Noon, New York time, on a Business Day, such transfers shall be made in immediately available funds no later than 3:00 p.m., New York time, that day; and, if the request therefor is received after 12:00 Noon, New York time, then no later than 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the next Business Day. The obligation of each Lender to transfer such funds is irrevocable, unconditional and without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have so made its transfer to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. (b) The amount of each Lender's Commitment Percentage of outstanding Revolving Loans shall be computed weekly (or more frequently in the Administrative Agent's discretion) and shall be adjusted upward or downward based on all Revolving Loans and repayments of Revolving Loans received by the Administrative Agent as of 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the first Business Day following the end of the period specified by the Administrative Agent (such date, the "Settlement Date"). 42 (c) The Administrative Agent shall deliver to each of the Lenders promptly after the Settlement Date a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Revolving Loans for the period and the amount of repayments received for the period. As reflected on the summary statement: each Lender shall transfer to the Administrative Agent (as provided below), or the Administrative Agent shall transfer to each Lender, such amounts as are necessary to insure that, after giving effect to all such transfers, the amount of Revolving Loans made by each Lender shall be equal to such Lender's applicable Commitment Percentage of Revolving Loans outstanding as of such Settlement Date. If the summary statement requires transfers to be made to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders and is received prior to 12:00 Noon, New York time, on a Business Day, such transfers shall be made in immediately available funds no later than 3:00 p.m., New York time, that day; and, if received after 12:00 Noon, New York time, then no later than 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the next Business Day. The obligation of each Lender to transfer such funds is irrevocable, unconditional and without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have so made its transfer to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. 2.8 Notes; Repayment of Loans. (a) The Loans made by each Lender (and to the Swingline Lender, with respect to Swingline Loans) shall be evidenced by a Note duly executed on behalf of the Borrowers, dated the Closing Date, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2, as applicable, payable to the order of each such Lender (or the Swingline Lender, as applicable) in an aggregate principal amount equal to such Lender's Commitment (or, in the case of the Note evidencing the Swingline Loans, $15,000,000). (b) Each Lender is hereby authorized by the Borrower to endorse on a schedule attached to each Note delivered to such Lender (or on a continuation of such schedule attached to such Note and made a part thereof), or otherwise to record in such Lender's internal records, an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each Loan from such Lender, each payment and prepayment of principal of any such Loan, each payment of interest on any such Loan and the other information provided for on such schedule; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make such a notation or any error therein shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans made by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Notes. (c) Upon receipt of an affidavit of a Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such Lender's Note and an indemnity in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Borrower, and upon cancellation of such Note, the Borrowers 43 will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement Note in favor of such Lender, in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor. 2.9 Interest on Loans. (a) Subject to Section 2.10, each Prime Rate Loan shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable) at a rate per annum that shall be equal to the then Prime Rate, plus the Applicable Margin for Prime Rate Loans. (b) Subject to Section 2.10, each LIBO Loan shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, plus the Applicable Margin for LIBO Loans. (c) Accrued interest on all Loans shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto, on the Termination Date, after the Termination Date on demand and (with respect to LIBO Loans) upon any repayment or prepayment thereof (on the amount prepaid). 2.10 Default Interest. Effective upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and at all times thereafter while such Event of Default is continuing, at the option of the Administrative Agent or upon the direction of the Required Lenders, interest shall accrue on all outstanding Loans (including Swingline Loans) (after as well as before judgment, as and to the extent permitted by law), and all fees payable under Sections 2.12 and 2.13 shall accrue, at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the rate (including the Applicable Margin) in effect from time to time plus 2.00% per annum, and such interest shall be payable on demand. 2.11 Certain Fees. The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Administrative Agent, the fees set forth in the Fee Letter as and when payment of such fees is due as therein set forth. 2.12 Unused Commitment Fee. The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") computed at a rate per annum, in accordance with the table set forth below (on the basis of actual days elapsed in a year of 360 days), of the average daily balance of the Unused Commitment for each day commencing on and including the Closing Date and ending on but excluding the Termination Date. The Commitment Fee shall initially be that rate set forth in Level II, subject to adjustment as provided below: 44 ------------- ----------------------- --------------------- Level Consolidated Leverage Commitment Fee Ratio ------------- ----------------------- --------------------- I Consolidated Leverage 0.50% Ratio equal to or greater than 3.50 to 1.00 ------------- ----------------------- --------------------- II Consolidated Leverage 0.375% Ratio equal to or greater than 1.00 to 1.00 and less than 3.50 to 1.00 ------------- ----------------------- --------------------- III Consolidated Leverage 0.375% Ratio less than 1.00 to 1.00 ------------- ----------------------- --------------------- The Commitment Fee shall be adjusted quarterly commencing with the fiscal quarter ending January 28, 2006, based on the financial statements and compliance certificate required to be delivered pursuant to Sections 5.1(b) and 5.1(c) below. Any change in the Commitment Fee shall be effective two (2) Business Days after the date of the Administrative Agent's receipt of the financial statements and compliance certificate required to be delivered pursuant to Sections 5.1(b) and 5.1(c) below. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, at the option of the Administrative Agent or at the direction of the Required Lenders, the Commitment Fee shall be determined in the manner set forth in Section 2.10. The Commitment Fee so accrued in any calendar quarter shall be payable on the last day of each calendar quarter, in arrears, commencing December 31, 2005, except that all Commitment Fees so accrued as of the Termination Date shall be payable on the Termination Date. The Administrative Agent shall pay the Commitment Fee to the Lenders based upon their Commitment Percentage. 2.13 Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrowers shall pay the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, on the last day of each calendar quarter, in arrears, a fee (each, a "Letter of Credit Fee") equal to the following per annum percentages of the face amount of the following categories of Letters of Credit outstanding during the subject quarter: (a) Each Standby Letter of Credit: At the then Applicable Margin per annum for LIBO Loans. 45 (b) Each Commercial Letter of Credit: Fifty percent (50%) of the Applicable Margin per annum for LIBO Loans. (c) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the option of the Administrative Agent or upon the direction of the Required Lenders, the Letter of Credit Fee set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above, shall be increased by an amount equal to two percent (2%) per annum. (d) The Borrowers shall pay to the applicable Issuing Bank, in addition to all Letter of Credit Fees otherwise provided for hereunder, a fronting fee (each a "Fronting Fee") in an amount equal to 0.125% of the face amount of each Letter of Credit payable on the issuance of such Letter of Credit. (e) The Borrowers shall pay to the applicable Issuing Bank, in addition to the Letter of Credit Fees and Fronting Fees otherwise provided for hereunder, fees and charges in connection with the issuance, negotiation, settlement, amendment and processing of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank as are customarily imposed by such Issuing Bank from time to time in connection with letter of credit transactions. (f) All Letter of Credit Fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed. 2.14 Nature of Fees. All fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent, for the respective accounts of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, and the Lenders, as provided herein. All fees shall be fully earned on the date when due and shall not be refundable under any circumstances. 2.15 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. (a) Upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lead Borrower may at any time or from time to time in part permanently reduce the Commitments. Each such reduction shall be in the principal amount of $2,500,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each such reduction shall (i) be applied ratably to the Commitments of each Lender and (ii) be irrevocable when given. At the effective time of each such reduction, the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for application as provided herein (i) all Commitment Fees accrued on the amount of the Commitments so reduced through the date thereof, (ii) any amount by which the Credit Extensions outstanding on such date exceed the amount to which the Commitments are to be reduced effective on such date, in each case pro rata based on the amount prepaid, and (iii) any Breakage Costs, if applicable. 46 (b) Upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lead Borrower may at any time terminate the Commitments. At the effective time of each such termination specified in such notice, the Borrowers shall repay to the Administrative Agent for application as provided herein all Obligations. 2.16 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBO Borrowing: (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lead Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter (but in any event, within two (2) Business Days) and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Lead Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Borrowing Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a LIBO Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a LIBO Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as a Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans. 2.17 Conversion and Continuation of Loans. The Lead Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers shall have the right at any time, (a) on three (3) Business Days' prior irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice, to be effective, must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the third Business Day preceding the date of any conversion), (x) to convert any outstanding Borrowings of Prime Rate Loans (but in no event Swingline Loans) to Borrowings of LIBO Loans, or (y) to continue an outstanding Borrowing of LIBO Loans for an additional Interest Period, (b) on one Business Day's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice, to be effective, must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the date of any conversion), to convert any outstanding Borrowings of LIBO Loans to a Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans, subject to the following: (i) no Borrowing of Loans may be converted into, or continued as, LIBO Loans at any time when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 47 (ii) if less than a full Borrowing of Loans is converted, such conversion shall be made pro rata among the Lenders, as applicable, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the Loans comprising such Borrowing held by such Lenders immediately prior to such conversion; (iii) the aggregate principal amount of Loans being converted into or continued as LIBO Loans shall be in an integral of $100,000 and at least $1,000,000; (iv) each Lender shall effect each conversion by applying the proceeds of its new LIBO Loan or Prime Rate Loan, as the case may be, to its Loan being so converted; (v) the Interest Period with respect to a Borrowing of LIBO Loans effected by a conversion or in respect to the Borrowing of LIBO Loans being continued as LIBO Loans shall commence on the date of conversion or the expiration of the current Interest Period applicable to such continued Borrowing, as the case may be; (vi) a Borrowing of LIBO Loans may be converted only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto; (vii) each request for a conversion or continuation of a Borrowing of LIBO Loans which fails to state an applicable Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one month; and (viii) no more than twenty (20) Borrowings of LIBO Loans may be outstanding at any time. If the Lead Borrower does not give notice to convert any Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans, or does not give notice to continue, or does not have the right to continue, any Borrowing as LIBO Loans, in each case as provided above, such Borrowing shall automatically be converted to, or continued as, as applicable, a Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans at the expiration of the then current Interest Period. The Administrative Agent shall, after it receives notice from the Borrower, promptly give each Lender notice of any conversion, in whole or part, of any Loan made by such Lender. 2.18 Mandatory Prepayment; Cash Collateral; Commitment Termination. The outstanding Obligations shall be subject to mandatory prepayment as follows: (a) If at any time the amount of the Credit Extensions exceeds the lower of (i) the then amount of the Total Commitments, and (ii) the then amount of the Borrowing Base, the Borrowers will immediately upon notice from the Administrative Agent (A) prepay the Loans in an amount necessary to eliminate such excess, and (B) if, after giving 48 effect to the prepayment in full of all outstanding Loans such excess has not been eliminated, deposit cash into the Cash Collateral Account in an amount equal to 105% of the Letters of Credit Outstanding. (b) To the extent required pursuant to Section 2.21, the Revolving Loans shall be repaid daily in accordance with the provisions of said Section 2.21. (c) Subject to the foregoing, outstanding Prime Rate Loans shall be prepaid before outstanding LIBO Loans are prepaid. Each partial prepayment of LIBO Loans shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000. No prepayment of LIBO Loans shall be permitted pursuant to this Section 2.18 other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, unless the Borrowers simultaneously reimburse the Lenders for all "Breakage Costs" (as defined below) associated therewith. In order to avoid such Breakage Costs, as long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the request of the Lead Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall hold all amounts required to be applied to LIBO Loans in the Cash Collateral Account and will apply such funds to the applicable LIBO Loans at the end of the then pending Interest Period therefor and such LIBO Loans shall continue to bear interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.9 until the amounts in the Cash Collateral Account have been so applied (provided that the foregoing shall in no way limit or restrict the Agents' rights upon the subsequent occurrence of an Event of Default). No partial prepayment of a Borrowing of LIBO Loans shall result in the aggregate principal amount of the LIBO Loans remaining outstanding pursuant to such Borrowing being less than $1,000,000 (unless all such outstanding LIBO Loans are being prepaid in full). Any prepayment of the Revolving Loans shall not permanently reduce the Commitments. (d) All amounts required to be applied to all Loans hereunder (other than Swingline Loans) shall be applied ratably in accordance with each Lender's Commitment Percentage. (e) Upon the Termination Date, the Commitments and the credit facility provided hereunder shall be terminated in full and the Borrowers shall pay, in full and in cash, all outstanding Loans and all other outstanding Obligations. 2.19 Optional Prepayment of Loans; Reimbursement of Lenders. (a) The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay outstanding Loans in whole or in part, (x) with respect to LIBO Loans, upon at least two Business Days' prior written, telex or facsimile notice to the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, and (y) with respect to Prime Rate Loans, upon at least one Business Day prior written, telex or facsimile notice to the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 p.m., New York time, subject to the following limitations: 49 (i) All prepayments under this Section 2.19 shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for application, first, to the prepayment of outstanding Swingline Loans, second, to the prepayment of other outstanding Loans ratably in accordance with each Lender's Commitment Percentage, and third, to the funding of a cash collateral deposit in the Cash Collateral Account in an amount equal to 105% of all Letter of Credit Outstandings. (ii) Subject to the foregoing, outstanding Prime Rate Loans shall be prepaid before outstanding LIBO Loans are prepaid. Each partial prepayment of LIBO Loans shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000. No prepayment of LIBO Loans shall be permitted pursuant to this Section 2.19 other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, unless the Borrowers simultaneously reimburse the Lenders for all "Breakage Costs" (as defined below) associated therewith. No partial prepayment of a Borrowing of LIBO Loans shall result in the aggregate principal amount of the LIBO Loans remaining outstanding pursuant to such Borrowing being less than $1,000,000 (unless all such outstanding LIBO Loans are being prepaid in full). (iii) Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount and Type of the Loans to be prepaid and, in the case of LIBO Loans, the Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such Loans were made. Each notice of prepayment shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrowers to prepay such Loan by the amount and on the date stated therein. The Administrative Agent shall, promptly after receiving notice from the Lead Borrower hereunder, notify each Lender of the principal amount and Type of the Loans held by such Lender which are to be prepaid, the prepayment date and the manner of application of the prepayment. (b) The Borrowers shall reimburse each Lender on demand for any loss incurred or to be incurred by it in the reemployment of the funds released (i) resulting from any prepayment (for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, conversion to Prime Rate Loans or acceleration by virtue of, and after, the occurrence of an Event of Default) of any LIBO Loan required or permitted under this Agreement, if such Loan is prepaid other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan or (ii) in the event that after the Lead Borrower delivers a notice of borrowing under Section 2.3 in respect of LIBO Loans, such Loans are not borrowed on the first day of the Interest Period specified in such notice of borrowing for any reason. Such loss shall be the amount as reasonably determined by such Lender as the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of interest which would have accrued to such Lender on the amount so paid or not borrowed at a rate of interest equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Loan, for the period from the date of such payment or failure to borrow to the last day (x) in the case of a payment or refinancing of a LIBO Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan, of the then current Interest Period for such Loan or (y) in the case of such failure to borrow, of the Interest Period for such LIBO Loan which would have commenced on the date of such 50 failure to borrow, over (B) the amount of interest which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the London interbank market (collectively, "Breakage Costs"). Any Lender demanding reimbursement for such loss shall deliver to the Lead Borrower from time to time one or more certificates setting forth the amount of such loss as determined by such Lender and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount was determined. (c) In the event the Borrowers fail to prepay any Loan on the date specified in any prepayment notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.19(a), the Borrowers on demand by any Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any actual loss incurred by such Lender as a result of such failure to prepay, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expenses incurred by reason of the acquisition of deposits or other funds by such Lender to fulfill deposit obligations incurred in anticipation of such prepayment. Any Lender demanding such payment shall deliver to the Lead Borrower from time to time one or more certificates setting forth the amount of such loss as determined by such Lender and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount was determined. (d) Whenever any partial prepayment of Loans are to be applied to LIBO Loans, such LIBO Loans shall be prepaid in the chronological order of their Interest Payment Dates. 2.20 Maintenance of Loan Account; Statements of Account. (a) The Administrative Agent shall maintain an account on its books in the name of the Borrowers (the "Loan Account") which will reflect (i) all Loans and other advances made by the Lenders to the Borrowers or for the Borrowers' account, (ii) all L/C Disbursements, fees and interest that have become payable as herein set forth, and (iii) any and all other monetary Obligations that have become payable. (b) The Loan Account will be credited with all amounts received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers or otherwise for the Borrowers' account, including all amounts received in the Bank of America Concentration Account from the Blocked Account Banks, and the amounts so credited shall be applied as set forth in Sections 2.22(a) and (b) After the end of each month, the Administrative Agent shall send to the Lead Borrower a statement accounting for the charges, loans, advances and other transactions occurring among and between the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrowers during that month. The monthly statements shall, absent manifest error, be an account stated, which is final, conclusive and binding on the Borrowers. 51 2.21 Cash Receipts. (a) At the request of Administrative Agent, at any time after Excess Availability falls below fifteen percent (15%) of the then Borrowing Base, or upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (i) a list of all present DDAs maintained by the Borrowers, which list includes, with respect to each depository (A) the name and address of that depository; (B) the account number(s) maintained with such depository; and (C) to the extent known, a contact person at such depository (the "DDA List"), (ii) notifications executed on behalf of the Borrowers to each depository institution identified on the DDA List in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, of the Administrative Agent's interest in such DDA (each, a "DDA Notification"), and (iii) notifications (the "Credit Card Notifications") executed on behalf of the Borrowers with each of the Borrowers' major credit card processors in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (b) Annexed hereto as Schedule 2.21(b) is a list describing all arrangements to which any Borrower is a party with respect to the payment to any Borrower of the proceeds of all credit card charges for sales by such Borrower. (c) On or prior to the Closing Date the Borrowers shall have entered into a Blocked Account Agreement with the Blocked Account Banks in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (d) The DDA Notifications and Credit Card Notifications shall require, after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Cash Dominion Event, the sweep on each Business Day of all available cash receipts and other proceeds from the sale or disposition of any Collateral, including, without limitation, the proceeds of all credit card charges (all such cash receipts and proceeds, "Cash Receipts"), to (x) a concentration account maintained by the Collateral Agent at Bank of America (the "Bank of America Concentration Account"), or (z) a Blocked Account, as the Administrative Agent may direct. (e) The Blocked Account Agreements shall require, after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Cash Dominion Event, the sweep on each Business Day of all Cash Receipts to the Bank of America Concentration Account or to such other account as the Administrative Agent may direct. (f) If at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Cash Dominion Event, any cash or cash equivalents owned by the Borrowers are deposited to any account (other than a DDA for which a DDA Notification has been delivered), or held or invested in any manner, otherwise than in a Blocked Account that is subject to a Blocked Account Agreement as required herein, the Administrative Agent shall require 52 the Borrowers to have all funds held in such account transferred to the Bank of America Concentration Account or such other Blocked Account as the Administrative Agent may direct. (g) The Borrowers may close DDAs or Blocked Accounts and/or open new DDAs or Blocked Accounts, subject to the execution and delivery to the Administrative Agent of appropriate DDA Notifications or Blocked Account Agreements consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.21. Unless consented to in writing by the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers may not enter into any agreements with additional credit card processors unless contemporaneously therewith, a Credit Card Notification is executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent. (h) The Bank of America Concentration Account is and shall remain, under the sole dominion and control of the Collateral Agent. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (i) below, (i) such Borrower has no right of withdrawal from the Bank of America Concentration Account, (ii) the funds on deposit in the Bank of America Concentration Account shall continue to be collateral security for all of the Obligations and (iii) the funds on deposit in the Bank of America Concentration Account shall be applied as provided in Section 2.22(a). (i) So long as no Cash Dominion Event has occurred and is continuing, the Borrowers may direct, and shall have sole control over, the manner of disposition of its funds in the DDA Accounts and the Blocked Accounts. (j) After the occurrence and during the continuation of a Cash Dominion Event, the Borrowers shall cause the ACH or wire transfer to, upon the Administrative Agent's instruction, any Blocked Account, no less frequently than daily (unless the Commitments have been terminated hereunder and the Obligations have been paid in full) of the then contents of each DDA, each such transfer to be net of any minimum balance, not to exceed $10,000, as may be required to be maintained in the subject DDA by the bank at which such DDA is maintained, and, in connection with each such transfer, the Borrowers shall also provide the Administrative Agent with an accounting of the contents of each DDA. (k) After the occurrence and during the continuation of a Cash Dominion Event, whether or not any Obligations are then outstanding, the Borrowers shall cause the ACH or wire transfer, upon the Administrative Agent's instruction, to the Bank of America Concentration Account of the then entire ledger balance of each Blocked Account, net of such minimum balance, not to exceed $10,000, as may be required to be maintained in the subject Blocked Account by the bank at which such Blocked Account is maintained. 53 (l) In the event that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.21, after the occurrence of a Cash Dominion Event, the Borrowers receive or otherwise have dominion and control of any such proceeds or collections, such proceeds and collections shall be held in trust by the Borrowers for the Administrative Agent and shall not be commingled with any of the Borrowers' other funds or deposited in any account of Borrower other than as instructed by the Administrative Agent. 2.22 Application of Payments. (a) As long as the time for payment of the Obligations has not been accelerated, all amounts received in the Bank of America Concentration Account from any source, including the Blocked Account Banks, and other amounts received by the Administrative Agent, shall be applied, on the day of receipt, in the following order: first, to pay any fees and expense reimbursements and indemnification then due and payable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, and the Collateral Agent; second, to pay interest then due and payable on Credit Extensions; third, to repay any outstanding Swingline Loans; fourth, to repay any outstanding Revolving Loans that are Prime Rate Loans and any outstanding reimbursement obligations under Letters of Credit; fifth, to repay any outstanding Revolving Loans that are LIBO Loans and all Breakage Costs due in respect of such repayment pursuant to Section 2.19(b) or, at the Lead Borrower's option, to fund a cash collateral deposit to the Cash Collateral Account sufficient to pay, and with direction to pay, all such outstanding LIBO Loans on the last day of the then-pending Interest Period therefor from such Cash Collateral Account; sixth, if an Event of Default exists, to fund a cash collateral deposit in the Cash Collateral Account in an amount equal to 105% of all Letter of Credit Outstandings; seventh, to pay all other Obligations that are then outstanding and then due and payable. If all amounts set forth in clauses first through and including seventh above are paid, any excess amounts shall be deposited in a separate cash collateral account, and shall be released to the Lead Borrower on the day of receipt. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall release the funds held in the Cash Collateral Account pursuant to clause fifth above to the Borrowers upon the Lead Borrower's request. (b) All credits against the Obligations shall be effective on the day of receipt thereof, and shall be conditioned upon final payment to the Administrative Agent of the items giving rise to such credits. If any item deposited to the Bank of America Concentration Account and credited to the Loan Account is dishonored or returned unpaid for any reason, whether or not such return is rightful or timely, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to reverse such credit and charge the amount of such item to the Loan Account and the Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders against all claims and losses resulting from such dishonor or return. 54 2.23 Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any holding company of any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or (ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or LIBO Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBO Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) other than Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 2.26 hereof , then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined shall be delivered to the Lead Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case 55 may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof. (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the relevant Change in Law shall constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation. 2.24 Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, if (x) any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for a Lender to make or maintain a LIBO Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to a LIBO Loan or (y) at any time any Lender determines that the making or continuance of any of its LIBO Loans has become impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the date hereof which adversely affects the London interbank market or the position of such Lender in the London interbank market, then, by written notice to the Lead Borrower, such Lender may (i) declare that LIBO Loans will not thereafter be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by the Borrowers for a LIBO Borrowing shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for a Prime Rate Loan unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and (ii) require that all outstanding LIBO Loans made by it be converted to Prime Rate Loans, in which event all such LIBO Loans shall be automatically converted to Prime Rate Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below. In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (a), all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the LIBO Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted LIBO Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the Prime Rate Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such LIBO Loans. (b) For purposes of this Section 2.24, a notice to the Lead Borrower by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective, and if any LIBO Loans shall then be outstanding, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period; and otherwise such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Lead Borrower. 2.25 Payments; Sharing of Setoff. (a) The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of drawings under Letters of Credit, or of amounts payable under Sections 2.19(b), 2.23 or 2.26, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., New York time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, 56 be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 40 Broad Street, Boston, Massachusetts, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.19(b), 2.23, 2.26 or 9.3 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document (other than payments with respect to LIBO Borrowings) shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, if any payment due with respect to LIBO Borrowings shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, unless that succeeding Business Day is in the next calendar month, in which event, the date of such payment shall be on the last Business Day of subject calendar month, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars. (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.22(a) hereof or Section 6.2 of the Security Agreement, as applicable. (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in drawings under Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in drawings under Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in drawings under Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in drawings under Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans, provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in 57 drawings under Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrowers or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrowers consent to the foregoing and agree, to the extent they may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrowers rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Lead Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to this Agreement, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under this Agreement until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 2.26 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrowers shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Agents, any Lender or any Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrowers shall make such deductions, and (iii) the Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. (b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. 58 (c) The Borrowers shall indemnify the Agents, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within ten (10) Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by any Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount was determined, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction in withholding tax shall deliver to the Lead Borrower and the Administrative Agent two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, or, in the case of a Foreign Lender's claiming exemption from or reduction in U.S. Federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Foreign Lender delivers a Form W-8BEN, a certificate representing that such Foreign Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrowers and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrowers (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Lender claiming complete exemption from or reduced rate of, United States federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming exemption for "portfolio interest" certifying that it is not a foreign corporation, partnership, estate or trust. Such forms shall be delivered by each Foreign Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a transferee that is a participation holder, on or before the date such participation holder becomes a transferee hereunder) and on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Lender changes its applicable lending office by designating a different lending office (a "New Lending Office"). In addition, each Foreign Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or 59 invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Lender. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.26(e), a Foreign Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this 2.26(e) that such Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver. (f) The Borrowers shall not be required to indemnify any Foreign Lender or to pay any additional amounts to any Foreign Lender in respect of United States federal withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) above to the extent that the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Foreign Lender to comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) above. Should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrowers shall, at such Lender's expense, take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes. 2.27 Security Interests in Collateral. To secure their Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Borrowers shall grant, and shall cause each Facility Guarantor to grant to the Collateral Agent, for its benefit and the ratable benefit of the other Secured Parties, a first-priority security interest in all of the Collateral pursuant hereto and to the Security Documents. 2.28 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.23, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.26, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.23 or 2.26, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment; provided, however, that the Borrowers shall not be liable for such costs and expenses of a Lender requesting compensation if (i) such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement on a date after the Closing Date and (ii) the relevant Change in Law occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party hereto. (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.23, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.26, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to 60 the restrictions contained in Section 9.5), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment to another Lender, the Borrowers shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.23 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.26, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Each Borrower, for itself and on behalf of each other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group, represents and warrants to the Agents and the Lenders that, after giving effect to the Mergers: 3.1 Organization; Powers.

THE AGENTS. 8.1 Administration by Administrative Agent. Each Lender, the Collateral Agent and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably designate Bank of America as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The general administration of the Loan Documents shall be by the Administrative Agent. The Lenders, the Collateral Agent and the Issuing Banks each hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent (i) to enter into the Loan Documents to which it is a party and (ii) at its discretion, to take or refrain from taking such actions as agent on its behalf and to exercise or refrain from exercising such powers under the Loan Documents and the Notes as are delegated by the terms hereof or thereof, as appropriate, together with all powers reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except as set forth in this Agreement and the remaining Loan Documents, nor shall it have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, responsibilities, duties, obligations, or liabilities shall be read into the Loan Documents or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. 8.2 The Collateral Agent. Each Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably (i) designate Bank of America as Collateral Agent under this 93 Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) authorize the Collateral Agent to enter into the Security Documents and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party and to perform its duties and obligations thereunder, together with all powers reasonably incidental thereto, and (iii) agree and consent to all of the provisions of the Security Documents. All Collateral shall be held or administered by the Collateral Agent (or its duly-appointed agent) for its benefit and for the ratable benefit of the other Secured Parties. Any proceeds received by the Collateral Agent from the foreclosure, sale, lease or other disposition of any of the Collateral and any other proceeds received pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents or the other Loan Documents shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent for application as provided in Sections 2.18, 2.22, or 7.4, as applicable. The Collateral Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except as set forth in this Agreement and the remaining Loan Documents, nor shall it have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, responsibilities, duties, obligations, or liabilities shall be read into the Loan Documents or otherwise exist against the Collateral Agent. 8.3 Sharing of Excess Payments. Each of the Lenders, the Agents and the Issuing Banks agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against the Borrowers, including, but not limited to, a secured claim under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim and received by such Lender, any Agent or any Issuing Bank under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of the Obligations owed it (an "excess payment") as a result of which such Lender, such Agent or such Issuing Bank has received payment of any Loans or other Obligations outstanding to it in excess of the amount that it would have received if all payments at any time applied to the Loans and other Obligations had been applied in the order of priority set forth in Section 7.4, then such Lender, Agent or Issuing Bank shall promptly purchase at par (and shall be deemed to have thereupon purchased) from the other Lenders, such Agent and such Issuing Bank, as applicable, a participation in the Loans and Obligations outstanding to such other Persons, in an amount determined by the Administrative Agent in good faith as the amount necessary to ensure that the economic benefit of such excess payment is reallocated in such manner as to cause such excess payment and all other payments at any time applied to the Loans and other Obligations to be effectively applied in the order of priority set forth in Section 7.4 pro rata in proportion to its Commitment Percentage; provided, that if any such excess payment is thereafter recovered or otherwise set aside such purchase of participations shall be correspondingly rescinded (without interest). The Borrowers expressly consent to the foregoing arrangements and agree that any Lender, any Agent or any Issuing Bank holding (or deemed to be holding) a participation in any Loan or other Obligation may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by such Borrower to such Lender, such Agent or such Issuing Bank as fully as if such Lender, Agent or such Issuing Bank held a Note and was the original obligee thereon, in the amount of such participation. 8.4 Agreement of Required Lenders. Upon any occasion requiring or permitting an approval, consent, waiver, election or other action on the part of only the Required Lenders, action shall be taken by the Agents for and on behalf or for the benefit of all Lenders upon the 94 direction of the Required Lenders, and any such action shall be binding on all Lenders. No amendment, modification, consent, or waiver shall be effective except in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.2. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Agents shall (subject to the provisions of Section 9.2) take such action with respect thereto as may be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided that unless and until the Agents shall have received such directions, the Agents may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action as they shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. In no event shall the Agents be required to comply with any such directions to the extent that the Agents believe that the Agents' compliance with such directions would be unlawful. 8.5 Liability of Agents. (a) Each of the Agents, when acting on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, may execute any of its respective duties under this Agreement by or through any of its respective officers, agents and employees, and none of the Agents nor their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks or any of them for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith, or be responsible to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks or to any of them for the consequences of any oversight or error of judgment, or for any loss, except to the extent of any liability imposed by law by reason of such Agent's own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agents and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees shall in no event be liable to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks or to any of them for any action taken or omitted to be taken by them pursuant to instructions received by them from the Required Lenders or in reliance upon the advice of counsel selected by it. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Agents, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, or agents (A) shall be responsible to any Lender or any Issuing Bank for the due execution, validity, genuineness, effectiveness, sufficiency, or enforceability of, or for any recital, statement, warranty or representation in, this Agreement, any Loan Document or any related agreement, document or order, or (B) shall be required to ascertain or to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of the terms, conditions, covenants, or agreements of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, or (C) shall be responsible to any Lender or any Issuing Bank for the state or condition of any properties of the Borrowers or any other obligor hereunder constituting Collateral for the Obligations of the Borrowers hereunder, or any information contained in the books or records of the Borrowers; or (D) shall be responsible to any Lender or any Issuing Bank for the validity, enforceability, collectibility, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other certificate, document or instrument furnished in connection therewith; or (E) shall be responsible to any Lender or any Issuing Bank for the validity, priority or perfection of any lien securing or purporting to secure the Obligations or the value or sufficiency of any of the Collateral. 95 (b) The Agents may execute any of their duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through their agents or attorneys-in-fact, and shall be entitled to the advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to their rights and duties hereunder or under the Loan Documents. The Agents shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by them with reasonable care. (c) None of the Agents nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, or agents shall have any responsibility to the Borrowers on account of the failure or delay in performance or breach by any Lender (other than by any Agent in its capacity as a Lender) or any Issuing Bank of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement or the Notes or any of the Loan Documents or in connection herewith or therewith. (d) The Agents shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, or other document or writing believed by them to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or persons, and upon the advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without, limitation, counsel to the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agents. The Agents shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless they shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as they deem appropriate or they shall first be indemnified to their satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by them by reason of the taking or failing to take any such action. 8.6 Notice of Default. The Agents shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Agents have actual knowledge of the same or has received notice from a Lender or the Lead Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agents obtain such actual knowledge or receives such a notice, the Agents shall give prompt notice thereof to each of the Lenders. The Agents shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders. Unless and until the Agents shall have received such direction, the Agents may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to any such Default or Event of Default as they shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lenders. 8.7 Lenders' Credit Decisions. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender, and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrowers and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and investigation into the business, assets, operations, property, and financial and other condition of the Borrowers and has made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it 96 will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in determining whether or not conditions precedent to closing any Loan hereunder have been satisfied and in taking or not taking any action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 8.8 Reimbursement and Indemnification. Each Lender agrees (i) to reimburse (x) each Agent for such Lender's Commitment Percentage of any expenses and fees incurred by such Agent for the benefit of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks under this Agreement, the Notes and any of the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, and any other expense incurred in connection with the operations or enforcement thereof not reimbursed by the Borrowers and (y) each Agent for such Lender's Commitment Percentage of any expenses of such Agent incurred for the benefit of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks that the Borrowers have agreed to reimburse pursuant to Section 9.3 and has failed to so reimburse and (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless the Agents and any of their directors, officers, employees, or agents, on demand, in the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against it or any of them in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by it or any of them under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the Loan Documents to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers (except such as shall result from their respective gross negligence or willful misconduct). The provisions of this Section 8.8 shall survive the repayment of the Obligations and the termination of the Commitments. 8.9 Rights of Agents. It is understood and agreed that Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers hereunder (including the right to give such instructions) as the other Lenders and may exercise such rights and powers, as well as its rights and powers under other agreements and instruments to which it is or may be party, and engage in other transactions with the Borrowers, as though it were not the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, respectively, of the Lenders under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Agents and their Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of commercial or investment banking, trust, advisory or other business with the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates as if it were not the Agent hereunder. 8.10 Notice of Transfer. The Agents may deem and treat a Lender party to this Agreement as the owner of such Lender's portion of the Loans for all purposes, unless and until, and except to the extent, an Assignment and Acceptance shall have become effective as set forth in Section 9.5(b). 8.11 Successor Agent. Any Agent may resign at any time by giving five (5) Business Days' written notice thereof to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks, the other Agents and the Lead 97 Borrower. Upon any such resignation of any Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent, which so long as there is no Default or Event of Default shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Borrower (whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation, the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, the other Agents and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a commercial bank (or affiliate thereof) organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of a least $500,000,000 which, so long as there is no Default or Event of Default, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Borrower (whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as such Agent, the provisions of this Section 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was such Agent under this Agreement. 8.12 Reports and Financial Statements. Promptly after receipt thereof from the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent shall remit to each Lender and the Collateral Agent copies of all financial statements required to be delivered by the Borrowers hereunder, all commercial finance examinations and appraisals of the Collateral received by the Administrative Agent and all notices received by the Administrative Agent under Section 5.2 hereof, and on request of any Lender, a copy of any Borrowing Base Certificate so received. 8.13 Delinquent Lender. If for any reason any Lender shall fail or refuse to abide by its obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation its obligation to make available to Administrative Agent its Commitment Percentage of any Revolving Loans, expenses or setoff or purchase its pro rata share of a participation interest in the Swingline Loans (a "Delinquent Lender") and such failure is not cured within ten (10) days of receipt from the Administrative Agent of written notice thereof, then, in addition to the rights and remedies that may be available to Agents, other Lenders, the Borrowers or any other party at law or in equity, and not in limitation thereof, (i) such Delinquent Lender's right to participate in the administration of, or decision-making rights related to, the Loans, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be suspended during the pendency of such failure or refusal, and (ii) a Delinquent Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the Borrowers, whether on account of outstanding Loans, interest, fees or otherwise, to the remaining non-delinquent Lenders for application to, and reduction of, their proportionate shares of all outstanding Loans until, as a result of application of such assigned payments the Lenders' respective Commitment Percentages of all outstanding Loans shall have returned to those in effect immediately prior to such delinquency and without giving effect to the nonpayment causing such delinquency. The Delinquent Lender's decision-making and participation rights and rights to payments as set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) hereinabove shall be restored only upon the payment by the Delinquent Lender of its Commitment Percentage of any Loans, any 98 participation obligation, or expenses as to which it is delinquent, together with interest thereon at the rate set forth in Section 2.10 hereof from the date when originally due until the date upon which any such amounts are actually paid. The non-delinquent Lenders shall also have the right, but not the obligation, in their respective, sole and absolute discretion, to acquire for no cash consideration, (pro rata, based on the respective Commitments of those Lenders electing to exercise such right) the Delinquent Lender's Commitment to fund future Loans (the "Delinquent Lender's Future Commitment"). Upon any such purchase of the Commitment Percentage of any Delinquent Lender's Future Commitment, the Delinquent Lender's share in future Loans and its rights under the Loan Documents with respect thereto shall terminate on the date of purchase, and the Delinquent Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer such interest, including, if so requested, an Assignment and Acceptance. Each Delinquent Lender shall indemnify the Agents and each non-delinquent Lender from and against any and all loss, damage or expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and funds advanced by any Agent or by any non-delinquent Lender, on account of a Delinquent Lender's failure to timely fund its pro rata share of a Loan or to otherwise perform its obligations under the Loan Documents. 8.14 Syndication Agent and Documentation Agent. Neither the Syndication Agent or Documentation Agent, in their capacity as such, shall have any obligation, responsibility or required performance hereunder and shall not become liable in any manner to any party hereto. No party shall have any obligation or liability, or owe any performance, hereunder, to the Syndication Agent or Documentation Agent in their capacity as such. 9. MISCELLANEOUS. 9.1 Notices.

(a) No failure or delay by the Agents, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Agents, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Agents and the Borrowers that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders, provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender or the Total Commitments without the written consent of all of the Lenders, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or L/C Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or L/C Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of the Commitments or the Maturity Date, without the written consent of all of the Lenders; (iv) change Sections 2.18, 2.21, or 2.22 or Section 6.2 of the Security Agreement, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section 9.2 or the definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) release any Borrower owning Inventory or the proceeds thereof from its obligations under any Loan Document, or limit its liability in respect of such Loan Document, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii) except for sales described in Section 6.5 or as permitted in the Security Documents, release any material portion of the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender, (viii) change the definition of the term "Borrowing Base" or any component definition thereof if as a result thereof the amounts available to be borrowed by the Borrowers would be increased, without the written consent of each Lender, provided that the foregoing shall not limit the discretion of the Administrative Agent to change, establish or eliminate any Reserves, (ix) change the definition of "Permitted Overadvance", without the written consent of each Lender, (x) subordinate the Obligations hereunder, or the Liens granted hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, to any other Indebtedness or Lien, as the case may be without the prior written consent of each Lender, and provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Agents or the applicable Issuing Bank without the prior written consent of the Agents or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be. 100 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.2, in the event that the Borrowers request that this Agreement or any other Loan Document be modified, amended or waived in a manner which would require the consent of the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.2(b) and such amendment is approved by the Required Lenders, but not by the requisite percentage of the Lenders, the Borrowers, and the Required Lenders shall be permitted to amend this Agreement without the consent of the Lender or Lenders which did not agree to the modification or amendment requested by the Borrowers (such Lender or Lenders, collectively the "Minority Lenders") to provide for (w) the termination of the Commitment of each of the Minority Lenders, (x) the addition to this Agreement of one or more other financial institutions, or an increase in the Commitment of one or more of the Required Lenders, so that the aggregate Commitments after giving effect to such amendment shall be in the same amount as the aggregate Commitments immediately before giving effect to such amendment, (y) if any Loans are outstanding at the time of such amendment, the making of such additional Loans by such new or increasing Lender or Lenders, as the case may be, as may be necessary to repay in full the outstanding Loans (including principal, interest, and fees) of the Minority Lenders immediately before giving effect to such amendment and (z) such other modifications to this Agreement or the Loan Documents as may be appropriate and incidental to the foregoing. (d) No notice to or demand on any Borrower shall entitle any Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. Each holder 101 of a Note shall be bound by any amendment, modification, waiver or consent authorized as provided herein, whether or not a Note shall have been marked to indicate such amendment, modification, waiver or consent and any consent by a Lender, or any holder of a Note, shall bind any Person subsequently acquiring a Note, whether or not a Note is so marked. No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective against the Borrowers unless signed by the Borrowers. 9.3 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) Except as otherwise limited herein, the Borrowers shall jointly and severally pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, and their Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Agents, outside consultants for the Agents, appraisers, and for commercial finance examinations, in connection with the arrangement of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, and (iii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel and any outside consultants for the Agents, any Issuing Bank or any Lender, for appraisers, commercial finance examinations, and environmental site assessments, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit; provided that the Lenders who are not the Agents or the Issuing Banks shall be entitled to reimbursement for no more than one counsel representing all such Lenders (absent a conflict of interest in which case the Lenders may engage and be reimbursed for additional counsel). (b) The Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify the Agents, the Issuing Banks and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including 102 any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated by any Borrower or any other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to Borrower or any other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any Affiliate of such Indemnitee (or of any officer, director, employee, advisor or agent of such Indemnitee or any such Indemnitee's Affiliates). In connection with any indemnified claim hereunder, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to select its own counsel and the Borrowers shall promptly pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. (c) To the extent that any Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Agents or any Issuing Bank under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agents or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Agents or such Issuing Bank. (d) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, no party hereto shall assert, and each party hereby waives, any claim against any Borrower or Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor. 9.4 Designation of Lead Borrower as Borrowers' Agent. (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Lead Borrower as that Borrower's agent to obtain Loans and Letters of Credit hereunder, the proceeds of which shall be available to each Borrower for those uses as those set forth herein. As the disclosed principal for its agent, each Borrower shall be obligated to the Agents and each Lender on account of Loans so made and Letters of Credit so issued hereunder as if made directly by the Lenders to that Borrower, notwithstanding the 103 manner by which such Loans and Letters of Credit are recorded on the books and records of the Lead Borrower and of any Borrower. (b) Each Borrower recognizes that credit available to it hereunder is in excess of and on better terms than it otherwise could obtain on and for its own account and that one of the reasons therefor is its joining in the credit facility contemplated herein with all other Borrowers. Consequently, each Borrower hereby assumes, guarantees, and agrees to discharge all Obligations of all other Borrowers as if the Borrower so assuming and guarantying were each other Borrower. (c) The Lead Borrower shall act as a conduit for each Borrower (including itself, as a "Borrower") on whose behalf the Lead Borrower has requested a Loan. The Lead Borrower shall cause the transfer of the proceeds of each Loan to the (those) Borrower(s) on whose behalf such Loan was obtained. Neither the Agents nor any Lender shall have any obligation to see to the application of such proceeds. (d) Each of the Borrowers shall remain jointly and severally liable to the Agents and the Lenders for the payment and performance of all Obligations (which payment and performance shall continue to be secured by all Collateral granted by each of the Borrowers) notwithstanding any determination by the Administrative Agent to cease making Loans or causing Letters of Credit to be issued to or for the benefit of any Borrower. (e) The authority of the Lead Borrower to request Loans on behalf of, and to bind, the Borrowers, shall continue unless and until the Administrative Agent acts as provided in subparagraph (c), above, or the Administrative Agent actually receives (i) written notice of: (i) the termination of such authority, and (ii) the subsequent appointment of a successor Lead Borrower, which notice is signed by the respective Presidents of each Borrower (other than the President of the Lead Borrower being replaced) then eligible for borrowing under this Agreement; and (ii) written notice from such successive Lead Borrower (i) accepting such appointment; (ii) acknowledging that such removal and appointment has been effected by the respective Presidents of such Borrowers eligible for borrowing under this Agreement; and (iii) acknowledging that from and after the date of such appointment, the newly appointed Lead Borrower shall be bound by the terms hereof, and that as used herein, the term "Lead Borrower" shall mean and include the newly appointed Lead Borrower. 104 9.5 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any such attempted assignment or transfer without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it), provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, each of the Lead Borrower (but only if no Event of Default then exists), the Agents and the Issuing Banks must give their prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.3). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section. 105 (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in Boston, Massachusetts a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and L/C Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Lead Borrower, the Issuing Banks and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers, the Agents, and the Issuing Banks, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it), provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation in the Commitments, the Loans and the Letters of Credit Outstandings shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents, provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.2(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section and Section 2.28, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits (and subject to the obligations) of Sections 2.23, 2.25, and 2.26 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.9 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.25(c) as though it were a Lender. 106 (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.23 or 2.26 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Lead Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.26 unless (i) the Lead Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 2.26(e) as though it were a Lender and (ii) such Participant is eligible for exemption from the withholding tax referred to therein, following compliance with Section 2.26(e). (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest, provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 9.6 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrowers in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Agents, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.23, 2.26, and 9.3 and Section 8 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. 9.7 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Agents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.1, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Agents and the Lenders and when the 108 Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 9.8 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. 9.9 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers against any of and all the obligations of the Borrowers now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured and regardless of the adequacy of the Collateral. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender may have. 9.10 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF. (b) The Borrowers agree that any suit for the enforcement of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be brought in any court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or any federal court sitting therein as the Administrative Agent may elect in its sole discretion and consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. The Borrowers hereby waive any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit is brought in an inconvenient forum. The Borrowers agree that any action commenced by any Borrower asserting any claim or counterclaim arising under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be brought solely in a court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or any federal court sitting therein as the Administrative Agent may elect in its sole discretion and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any such action. 108 (c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.1. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. 9.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. 9.12 Headings. Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. 9.13 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under Applicable Law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with Applicable Law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender. 9.14 Additional Waivers. (a) The Obligations are joint and several obligations of each Borrower. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the obligations of Borrower hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against any other 109 Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise, (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other agreement, with respect to any other Borrower of the Obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the security held by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party. (b) The obligations of each Borrower hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Borrower hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Borrower or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Borrower as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations). (c) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Borrower waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any other Borrower or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any other Borrower, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any other Borrower, or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any other Borrower, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Borrower hereunder except to the extent that all the Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Pursuant to Applicable Law, each Borrower waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to Applicable Law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Borrower against any other Borrower, as the case may be, or any security. (d) Upon payment by any Borrower of any Obligations, all rights of such Borrower against any other Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be 110 subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of any Borrower now or hereafter held by any other Borrower is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the Obligations. Until the Obligations are paid in full, none of the Borrowers will demand, sue for, or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Borrower on account of (a) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (b) any such indebtedness of any Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Collateral Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents. 9.15 Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Borrower in accordance with the Act. Each Borrower is in compliance, in all material respects, with the Patriot Act. No part of the proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, for any payments to any governmental official or employee, political party, official of a political party, candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended. 9.16 Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders agrees that it will use its best efforts not to disclose without the prior consent of the Borrowers (other than to its employees, auditors, counsel or other professional advisors, to Affiliates or to another Lender if the Lender or such Lender's holding or parent company in its sole discretion determines that any such party should have access to such information, which party shall be informed of the confidential nature thereof) any information with respect to any Borrower which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement provided that any Lender may disclose any such information (a) as has become generally available to the public, (b) as may be required or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal, state or federal regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such Lender or to the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors, (c) as may be required or appropriate in response to any summons or subpoena or in connection with any litigation, provided that if the Lender is able to do so prior to complying with the summons or subpoena, such Lender shall provide the Borrowers with prompt notice of such requested disclosure so that the Borrowers may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy (nothing contained herein however shall result in such Lender's non-compliance with Applicable Law), (d) in order to comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such Lender, (e) in connection with the enforcement of remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (f) to any prospective transferee in connection 111 with any contemplated transfer of any of the Loans or Notes or any interest therein by such Lender provided that such prospective transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section. The Borrowers hereby agree that the failure of a Lender to comply with the provisions of this Section 9.16 shall not relieve the Borrowers of any of their obligations to such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement (referred to below). W I T N E S S E T H WHEREAS, the Guarantors have entered into a certain Credit Agreement dated as of even date herewith (as such may be amended, modified, supplemented or restated hereafter, the "Credit Agreement") by and among (i) the Guarantors, (ii) the Lenders named therein, (iii) Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent for the Lenders, (iv) Citicorp North America, Inc., as Syndication Agent, (v) Merrill Lynch Capital, a division of Merrill Lynch Business Financial Services Inc., as Documentation Agent, (vi) Bank of America, N.A. and Citicorp North America, Inc., as Issuing Banks, and (vii) Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch Capital, a Division of Merrill Lynch Business Financial Services Inc., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Lead Bookrunners, pursuant to which Credit Agreement the Lenders have agreed to make Loans to the Guarantors, and the Issuing Banks have agreed to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Guarantors, upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in, the Credit Agreement; and -1- WHEREAS, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit are each conditioned upon, among other things, the execution and delivery by the Guarantors of a Guaranty in the form hereof. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual conditions and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Guarantors and the Agent hereby agree as follows: 1. Guaranty. Each Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment and performance (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) by each of the other Guarantors of all Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon the Guaranty notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation. The liabilities of each Guarantor hereunder are joint and several. 2. Obligations Not Affected. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any other Guarantor of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of the Guaranty and notice of protest for nonpayment. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against any other Guarantor under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise, (b) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this Guaranty, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, with respect to any particular Guarantor under the Credit Agreement, (c) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the security held by or on behalf of the Agent or any other Secured Party, (d) the failure to provide notice of any Default or Event of Default, of any inability to enforce the Obligations or any provisions of the Loan Documents, or any rights against any Collateral, (e) any act or omission on the part of the Agent which may impair or prejudice any rights of such other Guarantor, including rights to obtain subrogation, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or any other reimbursement from any Guarantor or other Person, or otherwise operate as a deemed release or discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity, (f) any statute of limitations or other rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than the obligation of the principal, (g) any "single action" or "anti-deficiency" law which would otherwise prevent the Agent from bringing any action, including any claim for a deficiency, against such Guarantor before or after the Agent's commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale or otherwise, or any other law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Agent, and (h) any act or failure to act on the part of any other Guarantor, or by noncompliance by the Guarantors -2- with the terms, provisions and covenants of any Loan Document, regardless of any knowledge thereof which the Agent may be charged; and each Guarantor waives all demands and notices of every kind with respect to the foregoing. To the extent not referred to above, each Guarantor waives (a) all defenses (other than payment) which the Guarantors may now or hereafter have to the payment of the Obligations, together with all suretyship defenses, which could otherwise be asserted by such Guarantor and (b) any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any other Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any other Guarantor, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. 3. Security. Each of the Guarantors authorizes the Agent and each of the other Secured Parties to (a) take and hold security for the payment of the Guaranty and the Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security, (b) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as they in their sole discretion may determine and (c) release or substitute any one or more endorsees or other obligors. 4. Guaranty of Payment. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that this Guaranty constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Agent or any other Secured Party to any of the Collateral or other security held for payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of any other Guarantor or any other Person or to any other guarantor of all or part of the Obligations. 5. No Discharge or Diminishment of Guaranty. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. 6. Agent's Power to Waive, Etc. Each Guarantor grants to the Agent full power in its sole discretion, without notice to or consent of such Guarantor (such notice and consent being expressly waived to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law), and without in any way affecting the liability of such Guarantor hereunder: a. to waive compliance with, any Default or Event of Default under, and to consent to any amendment to or modification or termination of any terms or provisions of, or to give any waiver in respect of, any of the Loan Documents, the Collateral, the Obligations or any guaranty thereof (each as from time to time in effect); -3- b. to grant any extensions of the Obligations, and any other indulgence with respect thereto, and to effect any total or partial release (by operation of law or otherwise), discharge, compromise or settlement with respect to the obligations of any other Person in respect of the Obligations, whether or not rights against any Guarantor hereunder are reserved in connection therewith; c. to take security in any form for the Obligations, and to consent to the addition to or the substitution, exchange, release or other disposition of, or to deal in any other manner with, any part of any property contained in the Collateral whether or not the property, if any, received upon the exercise of such power shall be of a character or value the same as or different from the character or value of any property disposed of, and to obtain, modify or release any present or future guaranties of the Obligations and to proceed against any of the Collateral or such guaranties in any order; d. to collect or liquidate or realize upon any of the Obligations or the Collateral in any manner or to refrain from taking any such action; and e. to extend credit under any of the Loan Documents, or otherwise, in such amount and on such terms as the Agent may determine in its sole discretion, including increasing the amount of credit and the interest rate and fees with respect thereto, even though the condition of the Obligors (financial or otherwise, on an individual or Consolidated basis) may have deteriorated since the date hereof. 7. Certain Guarantor Representations. Each Guarantor represents, as to itself, as of the date hereof that: a. it is in the best interest of such Guarantor, is consistent with the purposes for which such Guarantor was organized as an integral part of the business conducted and proposed to be conducted by the Borrower Affiliated Group, and is reasonably necessary and convenient to the conduct of such business, to induce the Agent and the Lenders to enter into the Credit Agreement and to extend credit to the Guarantors by undertaking the obligations set forth in this Guaranty; b. the business of such Guarantor benefits from the successful performance of the business of each other Guarantor and each other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group, and the Borrower Affiliated Group as a whole; the failure of any member of the Borrower Affiliated Group to cooperate with all other members of the Borrower Affiliated Group in the conduct of their respective businesses is reasonably likely to have an adverse impact on the business of each other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group; and the failure of any member of the Borrower Affiliated Group to associate or cooperate with all other members of the Borrower -4- Affiliated Group is reasonably likely to impair the goodwill of the Borrower Affiliated Group as a whole; c. the credit to be made available by the Lenders under the Loan Documents will directly or indirectly inure to such Guarantor's benefit; d. by virtue of the foregoing such Guarantor is receiving at least reasonably equivalent value from the Agent and the Lenders for its guaranty hereunder; and e. such Guarantor is Solvent. 8. Defenses of Guarantors Waived. The Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any other Guarantor, or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any other Guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent that all the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. Pursuant to, and to the extent permitted by, Applicable Law, each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to Applicable Law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any other Guarantor or any security. 9. Agreement to Pay; Subordination. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Agents or any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Guarantor or any other Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each of the Guarantors hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Agents or such other Secured Party as designated thereby in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligations. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to an Agent or any other Secured Party as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against any other Guarantor or any other Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of any Guarantor or any other Borrower now or hereafter held by any other Guarantor is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all of the Obligations. After the occurrence of Default or an Event of Default, none of the Guarantors will demand, sue for, or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness until payment in full in cash of the Obligations, termination of Lenders' obligations to make Loans and termination of the Issuing Banks' obligation to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to -5- any Guarantor on account of (a) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (b) any such indebtedness of any Guarantor or any other Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents. 10. Limitation on Guaranty of Obligations. In any action or proceeding with respect to any Guarantor involving any state corporate law, or any state or Federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of such Guarantor under Section 1 hereof would otherwise be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under said Section 1, then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Guarantor, any Lender, the Agent or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding. 11. Information. Each of the Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each other Guarantor's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Agents or the other Secured Parties will have any duty to advise any of the Guarantors of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks. 12. Termination. The Guaranty (a) shall terminate when all the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash, the Commitments have been terminated under the Credit Agreement, the Letter of Credit Outstandings have been reduced to zero, or fully cash collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the Issuing Banks and the Agent, and the Issuing Banks have no further obligation to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement and (b) shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Secured Party or any Guarantor upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any other Guarantor or any Borrower or otherwise. Not later than five days after receipt of notice from the Agent, the Guarantors shall pay to the Agent an amount equal to the amount of such repayment or return for which the Agent or the Banks have so become liable. Payments hereunder by the Guarantors may be required by the Agent on any number of occasions. 13. Costs of Enforcement. The Guarantors will pay on demand (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents and their Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Agents and any outside consultants for -6- the Agents, in connection with the preparation and administration of this Guaranty or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents, the Issuing Banks or any Lender, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel and any outside consultants for the Agents, the Issuing Banks or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of the rights of the Agents, the Issuing Banks or any Lender in connection with the Loan Documents, including their rights under this Guaranty; provided that the Lenders who are not the Agents shall be entitled to reimbursement for no more than one counsel representing all such Lenders. 14. Binding Effect; Several Agreement; Assignments. Whenever in this Guaranty any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party. All covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Guarantors that are contained in this Guaranty shall bind and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Guarantor shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void). This Guaranty shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Guarantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Guarantor without the approval of any other Guarantor and without affecting the obligations of any other Guarantor hereunder. 15. Waivers; Amendment. (a) The rights, remedies, powers, privileges, and discretions of the Agents hereunder and under Applicable Law (herein, the "Agents' Rights and Remedies") shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which it would otherwise have. No delay or omission by the Agents in exercising or enforcing any of the Agents' Rights and Remedies shall operate as, or constitute, a waiver thereof. No waiver by the Agents of any Event of Default or of any default under any other agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other default hereunder or under any other agreement. No single or partial exercise of any of the Agents' Rights or Remedies, and no express or implied agreement or transaction of whatever nature entered into between the Agents and any Person, at any time, shall preclude the other or further exercise of the Agents' Rights and Remedies. No waiver by the Agents of any of the Agents' Rights and Remedies on any one occasion shall be deemed a waiver on any subsequent occasion, nor shall it be deemed a continuing waiver. The Agents' Rights and Remedies may be exercised at such time or times and in such order of preference as the Agents may determine. The Agents' Rights and Remedies may be exercised without resort or regard to any other source of satisfaction of the Obligations. No waiver of any provisions of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor or any -7- other Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (b) Neither this Guaranty nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the Agents and the Guarantor or Guarantors with respect to whom such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.2 of the Credit Agreement. 16. Copies and Facsimiles. This instrument and all documents which have been or may be hereinafter furnished by the Guarantors to any of the Agents may be reproduced by the Agents by any photographic, microfilm, xerographic, digital imaging, or other process. Any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made in the regular course of business). Any facsimile which bears proof of transmission shall be binding on the party which or on whose behalf such transmission was initiated and likewise so admissible in evidence as if the original of such facsimile had been delivered to the party which or on whose behalf such transmission was received. 17. Governing Law. THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF. 18. Notices. All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Section 9.1 of the Credit Agreement. 19. Survival of Agreement; Severability. (a) All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Guarantors herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Guaranty or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Agents and the other Secured Parties and shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit by the Issuing Banks regardless of any investigation made by the Secured Parties or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the Obligations are outstanding and unpaid or the Letter of Credit Outstandings do not equal zero, or are not fully cash collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the Issuing Banks and the Agent, and as long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. (b) Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the -8- remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. 20. Counterparts. This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Guaranty by telecopy shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. 21. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) Each of the Guarantors agrees that any suit for the enforcement of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document may be brought in any court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or any federal court sitting therein as the Agent may elect in its sole discretion and consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. Each Guarantor hereby waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit is brought in an inconvenient forum.. (b) Each party to this Guaranty irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 18. Nothing in this Guaranty or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. 22. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS GUARANTY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 21. 23. Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Guarantors against any of and all the obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such -9- Lender shall have made any demand under this Guaranty and although such obligations may be unmatured and regardless of the adequacy of the Collateral. The rights of each Lender under this Section 23 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Lender may have. [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS] -10-

Each Grantor agrees not to effect or permit any change referred to in the preceding sentence unless all filings have been made under the UCC or otherwise that are required in order for the Collateral Agent to continue at all times following such change to have a valid, legal and perfected first priority security interest in all of the Collateral. (b) Each Grantor agrees to maintain, at its own cost and expense, such complete and accurate records with respect to the Collateral owned by it as is consistent with its current practices and in accordance with such prudent and standard practices used in industries that are the same as, or similar to, those in which such Grantor is engaged, and, at such time or times as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, promptly to prepare and deliver to the Collateral Agent a duly certified schedule or schedules in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent showing the identity, amount and location of any and all Collateral. 4.3 Protection of Security. Each Grantor shall, at its own cost and expense, take any and all actions reasonably necessary to defend title to the Collateral against all Persons and to defend the Security Interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral and the priority thereof against any Lien not expressly permitted pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Credit Agreement. 4.4 Further Assurances. Each Grantor agrees, at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge, deliver and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents and take all such actions as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request to better assure, preserve, protect and perfect the Security Interest and the rights and remedies created hereby, including the payment of any fees and taxes required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the granting of the Security Interest and the filing of any Financing Statements (including Fixture Filings) or other documents in connection herewith or therewith. If any amount payable under or in connection with any of the Collateral shall be or become evidenced by any promissory note or other instrument, such note or instrument shall be promptly pledged and delivered to the Collateral Agent, duly endorsed in a manner satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. 4.5 Inspection and Verification. Without limiting the terms and conditions of Sections 5.9 of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent and such Persons as the Collateral -11- Agent may reasonably designate shall have the right, at the Grantors' own cost and expense, on reasonable prior notice except if an Event of Default then exists, to inspect the Collateral, all records related thereto (and to make extracts and copies from such records) and the premises upon which any of the Collateral is located, to discuss the Grantors' affairs with the officers of the Grantors and their independent accountants and to verify the validity, amount, quality, quantity, value, condition and status of, or any other matter relating to, the Collateral, including, in the case of Accounts or Collateral in the possession of any third Person, by contacting Account Debtors or the third Person possessing such Collateral for the purpose of making such a verification, provided that so long as the Credit Extensions are less than fifty (50%) of the lesser of the Total Commitments or the Borrowing Base, there may be only one such appraisal and one commercial finance examination in any twelve month period following the Closing Date, and if the Credit Extensions are at any time equal to or greater than fifty (50%) of the lesser of the Total Commitments or the then Borrowing Base, there may be only two such appraisals and two commercial finance examinations in any twelve month period following the Closing Date, in each case unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (in which event the Collateral Agent may undertake such additional appraisals and commercial finance examinations as it deems appropriate). The Collateral Agent shall have the absolute right to share any information it gains from such inspection or verification with any Secured Party. 4.6 Taxes; Encumbrances. At its option, the Collateral Agent may discharge past due taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and not permitted pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Credit Agreement, and may take any other action which the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or desirable to repair, maintain or preserve any of the Collateral to the extent any Grantor fails to do so as required by the Credit Agreement or this Agreement, and each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent on demand for any payment made or any expense incurred by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the foregoing authorization; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall not have any obligation to undertake any of the foregoing and shall have no liability on account of any action so undertaken except where there is a specific finding in a judicial proceeding (in which the Collateral Agent has had an opportunity to be heard), from which finding no further appeal is available, that the Collateral Agent had acted in actual bad faith or in a grossly negligent manner; and provided further that the making of any such payments by the Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default arising from the Grantor's failure to have made such payments. Nothing in this Section 4.6 shall be interpreted as excusing any Grantor from the performance of any covenants or other promises of any Grantor with respect to taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances and maintenance as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. 4.7 Assignment of Security Interest. (a) If at any time any Grantor shall take a security interest in any property of an Account Debtor or any other Person to secure payment and performance of an -12- Account, such Grantor shall promptly assign such security interest to the Collateral Agent. Such assignment need not be filed of public record unless necessary to continue the perfected status of the security interest against creditors of, and transferees from, the Account Debtor or other Person granting the security interest. (b) To the extent that any Grantor is a beneficiary under any written letter of credit now or hereafter issued in favor of such Grantor, such Grantor shall deliver such letter of credit to the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent shall from time to time, at the request and expense of such Grantor, make such arrangements with such Grantor as are in the Collateral Agent's reasonable judgment necessary and appropriate so that such Grantor may make any drawing to which such Grantor is entitled under such letter of credit, without impairment of the Collateral Agent's perfected security interest in such Grantor's rights to proceeds of such letter of credit or in the actual proceeds of such drawing. At the Collateral Agent's request, such Grantor shall, for any letter of credit, whether or not written, now or hereafter issued in favor of such Grantor as beneficiary, execute and deliver to the issuer and any Confirmer of such letter of credit an assignment of proceeds form, in favor of the Collateral Agent and satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and such issuer or (as the case may be) such Confirmer, requiring the proceeds of any drawing under such letter of credit to be paid directly to the Collateral Agent. 4.8 Continuing Obligations of the Grantors. Each Grantor shall remain liable to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it under each contract, agreement or instrument relating to the Collateral, all in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, and each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties from and against any and all liability for such performance. 4.9 Use and Disposition of Collateral. None of the Grantors shall make or permit to be made an assignment, pledge or hypothecation of the Collateral or shall grant any other Lien in respect of the Collateral, except as expressly permitted by Section 6.2 of the Credit Agreement. Except as expressly permitted in the Credit Agreement, none of the Grantors shall make or permit to be made any transfer of the Collateral, and each Grantor shall remain at all times in possession of the Collateral owned by it, except that (a) Inventory may be sold in the ordinary course of business, (b) a Grantor may transfer Collateral to any other Grantor, and (c) unless and until the Collateral Agent shall notify the Grantors that an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and that the Grantors shall not sell, convey, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Collateral (which notice may be given by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing), the Grantors may use and dispose of the Collateral in any lawful manner not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document. 4.10 Limitation on Modification of Accounts. None of the Grantors will, without the Collateral Agent's prior written consent, grant any extension of the time of payment of any of the -13- Accounts, compromise, compound or settle the same for less than the full amount thereof, release, wholly or partly, any Person liable for the payment thereof or allow any credit or discount whatsoever thereon, other than extensions, releases, credits, discounts, compromises or settlements granted or made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with its current practices. 4.11 Insurance. (a) The Grantors shall maintain insurance on the Collateral as required by Section 5.7 of the Credit Agreement. All such insurance which covers the Collateral shall include an endorsement in favor of the Collateral Agent, which endorsement shall provide that the insurance, to the extent of the Collateral Agent's interest therein, shall not be impaired or invalidated, in whole or in part, by reason of any act or neglect of any Grantor or by the failure of any Grantor to comply with any warranty or condition of the policy. (b) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Collateral Agent (and all officers, employees or agents designated by the Collateral Agent) as such Grantor's true and lawful agent (and attorney-in-fact), for the purpose of making, settling and adjusting claims in respect of Collateral under policies of insurance, endorsing the name of such Grantor on any check, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and for making all determinations and decisions with respect thereto. In the event that any Grantor at any time or times shall fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies of insurance required hereby or to pay any premium in whole or part relating thereto, the Collateral Agent may, without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of the Grantors hereunder or any Default or Event of Default, in its sole discretion, obtain and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premium and take any other actions with respect thereto as the Collateral Agent deems advisable. All sums disbursed by the Collateral Agent in connection with this Section 4.11, including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto, shall be payable, upon demand, by the Grantors to the Collateral Agent and shall be additional Obligations secured hereby. 4.12 Commercial Tort Claims.

At the request of the Collateral Agent, each Grantor shall legend, in form and manner reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, its Accounts and its books, records and documents evidencing or pertaining thereto with an appropriate reference to the fact that such Accounts have been assigned to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and that the Collateral Agent has a security interest therein. -14- 4.14 General Intangibles. Each Grantor shall apply for, and diligently pursue applications for, registration of its ownership of the General Intangibles constituting Collateral for which registration is appropriate, and which are material to its business, and will use such other reasonable measures as are appropriate to preserve its rights in its other General Intangibles constituting Collateral, except that such Grantor may abandon such rights as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the value of such General Intangibles. Each Grantor will, at the request of the Collateral Agent, retain current copies of all materials created by or furnished to such Grantor on which is recorded then current information relating to any computer programs or data bases that such Grantor has developed or otherwise has the right to use from time to time.

If any Securities now held or hereafter acquired by any Grantor are Uncertificated Securities (other than treasury stock of such Grantor) and are issued to such Grantor or its nominee directly by the Issuer thereof, such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, at the Collateral Agent's request and option, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, either (i) cause the Issuer to agree to comply with instructions from the Collateral Agent as to such Securities, without further consent of such Grantor or the nominee, or (ii) arrange for the Collateral Agent to become the registered owner of the Securities. If any Grantor, as registered holder of Investment Property, receives any stock certificate, option or right, or other distribution, whether as an addition to, in substitution of, or in exchange for, such Investment Property, or otherwise, such Grantor agrees to accept the same in trust for the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties and to forthwith endorse, assign and deliver the same to the Collateral Agent, accompanied by such instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as the Collateral Agent may from time to time specify, to be held by the Collateral Agent as Collateral. If any Securities, whether Certificated Securities or Uncertificated Securities, or other Investment Property now held or hereafter acquired by any Grantor are held by such Grantor or its nominee through a Securities Intermediary or Commodity Intermediary, such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, at the Collateral Agent's request and option, pursuant to an agreement in form and substance -15- reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, either (i) cause such Securities Intermediary or Commodity Intermediary, as the case may be, to agree to comply with Entitlement Orders or other instructions from the Collateral Agent to such Securities Intermediary as to such Securities or other Investment Property or, as the case may be, to apply any value distributed on account of any commodity contract as directed by the Collateral Agent to such Commodity Intermediary, in each case without the further consent of such Grantor or such nominee, or (ii) in the case of Financial Assets or other Investment Property held through a Securities Intermediary, arrange for the Collateral Agent to become the Entitlement Holder with respect to such Investment Property.

In addition, (i) so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Grantor shall have the right to exercise all voting, consensual and other powers of ownership pertaining to the Securities for all purposes not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other instrument or agreement referred to herein or therein; and the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to such Grantor all such proxies, powers of attorney, dividend and other orders, and all such instruments, without recourse, as such Grantor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Grantor to exercise the rights and powers which it is entitled to exercise pursuant hereto, and (ii) so long as no Cash Dominion Event shall have occurred and be continuing, each Grantor shall be entitled to receive and retain any dividends or other distributions on the Securities. 4.16 Electronic Chattel Paper and Transferable Records.

Section 7001, et. seq., or in Section 16 of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act as in effect in any jurisdiction applicable to such Grantor, such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, at the request of the Collateral Agent, shall take such action as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request to vest in the Collateral Agent control under the UCC, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, as the case may be, of such transferable record. The Collateral Agent agrees with each Grantor that so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur after taking into account the following, the Collateral Agent will arrange, pursuant to procedures satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and so long as such procedures will not result in Collateral Agent's loss of control under the UCC, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, -17- as the case may be, for such Grantor to make such necessary alterations to the Electronic Chattel Paper or transferable record as are permitted under the UCC, the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, as the case may be. 4.17 Tangible Chattel Paper, Notes and Other Instruments. If at any time any amount payable to any Grantor under or in connection with any of the Collateral is evidenced by any Tangible Chattel Paper, promissory note, trade acceptances or other Instrument, such Grantor shall promptly deliver the same to the Collateral Agent, accompanied by such instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request. 4.18 Bailments, Etc. If any Collateral costing in excess of $3,000,000 is at any time in the possession or control of any one warehouseman for more than a temporary period of time (not to exceed five (5) Business Days), bailee or any Grantor's agents, such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and, upon the request of the Collateral Agent, (i) notify such warehouseman, bailee or agent to hold all such Collateral for the Collateral Agent's account subject to the Collateral Agent's instructions, (ii) obtain from such warehouseman, bailee or agent a written acknowledgment in form reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent that such Person holds possession of the Collateral for the Collateral Agent's benefit and shall act upon the Collateral Agent's instructions with respect to such Collateral without the further consent of such Grantor, (iii) deliver any negotiable warehouse receipt, bill of lading or other document of title issued with regard to the Collateral to the Collateral Agent appropriately endorsed to the Collateral Agent's order, and/or (iv) arrange for the issuance in the name of the Collateral Agent, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, any nonnegotiable document of title covering such Collateral. The Collateral Agent agrees with each Grantor that the Collateral Agent shall not give any such instructions unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur after taking into account any action by such Grantor with respect to such warehouseman, bailee or agent. 4.19 Other Perfection, Etc. The Grantors shall at any time and from time to time take such steps as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request for the Collateral Agent (a) to obtain "control" of any Deposit Accounts or Letter-of-Credit Rights, with any agreements establishing control to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, and (b) otherwise to insure the continued perfection of the Collateral Agent's security interest in any of the Collateral with the priority described in Section 3.4 and of the preservation of its rights therein. The Collateral Agent agrees with each Grantor that the Collateral Agent shall not give notice to any depositary under any control, blocked account or similar agreement in respect of a Deposit Account unless a Cash Dominion Event has occurred and is continuing. 4.20 Assignment of Claims Act. If at any time any Accounts of any Grantor arise from contracts with the United States of America or any department, agency or instrumentality thereof, such Grantor will promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof and shall execute all assignments and take all steps reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent in order that all -17- monies due and to become due thereunder will be assigned and paid to the Collateral Agent and notice thereof given to the federal authorities under the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940, 41 U.S.C. Section 15. 4.21 Notices and Reports Pertaining to Collateral. In addition to any other notice or reporting requirement imposed on the Grantors under this Agreement and the Credit Agreement, the Grantors will, with respect to the Collateral: (a) Promptly notify the Collateral Agent when any Grantor obtains knowledge of actual or imminent bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding of any material Account Debtor or Issuer of Investment Property; (b) Promptly notify the Collateral Agent of any material return or adjustment, rejection, repossession, or loss or damage of or to merchandise represented by Accounts or constituting Inventory and of any material credit, adjustment or dispute arising in connection with the goods or services represented by Accounts or constituting Inventory; (c) Promptly after the application by any Grantor for registration of any General Intangibles, notify the Collateral Agent thereof; and (d) Promptly notify the Collateral Agent in the event of a material loss or damage to the Collateral, if such loss or damage is not covered by insurance, of any reclamation or repossession of or any action by a creditor to reclaim or repossess any material asset(s) of any Grantor, of any material adverse change in the Collateral, and of any other occurrence that may have a Material Adverse Effect on the Security Interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral. SECTION 5 Collections 5.1 Collections. (a) Each Grantor shall at all times comply with the Cash Receipts provisions of Section 2.21 of the Credit Agreement including, without limitation, after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Cash Dominion Event, causing the sweep on each Business Day of all Cash Receipts into the Bank of America Concentration Account or a Blocked Account, as provided for in the Credit Agreement. (b) Without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent, no Grantor shall modify or amend the instructions pursuant to any of the DDA Notifications, the Credit Card Notifications, or the Blocked Account Agreements. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Grantor shall, and the Collateral Agent hereby authorizes each Grantor to, enforce and collect all amounts owing on the Inventory and -18- Accounts, for the benefit and on behalf of the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties; provided, however, that such privilege may, at the option of the Collateral Agent, be terminated upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default. 5.2 Power of Attorney. Each Grantor irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Collateral Agent (and all officers, employees or agents designated by the Collateral Agent) as such Grantor's true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact, and in such capacity the Collateral Agent shall have the right, with power of substitution for each Grantor and in each Grantor's name or otherwise, for the use and benefit of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties, (a) at any time, whether or not a Default or Event of Default has occurred, to take actions required to be taken by the Grantors under Section 2.1 of this Agreement, (b) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Cash Dominion Event or as otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement, (i) to take actions required to be taken by the Grantors under Section 5.1 of this Agreement, and (ii) to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral or any part thereof; and (c) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or as otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement, (i) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any of the Collateral; (ii) to sign the name of any Grantor on any invoices, schedules of Collateral, freight or express receipts, or bills of lading storage receipts, warehouse receipts or other documents of title relating to any of the Collateral; (iii) to sign the name of any Grantor on any notice to such Grantor's Account Debtors; (iv) to sign the name of any Grantor on any proof of claim in bankruptcy against Account Debtors, and on notices of lien, claims of mechanic's liens, or assignments or releases of mechanic's liens securing the Accounts; (v) to sign change of address forms to change the address to which each Grantor's mail is to be sent to such address as the Collateral Agent shall designate; (vi) to receive and open each Grantor's mail, remove any Proceeds of Collateral therefrom and turn over the balance of such mail either to the Lead Borrower or to any trustee in bankruptcy or receiver of a Grantor, or other legal representative of a Grantor whom the Collateral Agent determines to be the appropriate person to whom to so turn over such mail; (vii) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Collateral; (viii) to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the Collateral; (ix) to take all such action as may be necessary to obtain the payment of any letter of credit and/or banker's acceptance of which any Grantor is a beneficiary; (x) to repair, manufacture, assemble, complete, package, deliver, alter or supply goods, if any, necessary to fulfill in whole or in part the purchase order of any customer of any Grantor; (xi) to use, license or transfer any or all General Intangibles of any Grantor; and (xii) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Collateral, and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to make -19- any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party, or to present or file any claim or notice. It is understood and agreed that the appointment of the Collateral Agent as the agent and attorney-in-fact of the Grantors for the purposes set forth above is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. 5.3 No Obligation to Act. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to do any of the acts or to exercise any of the powers authorized by Section 5.2, but if the Collateral Agent elects to do any such act or to exercise any of such powers, it shall not be accountable for more than it actually receives as a result of such exercise of power, and shall not be responsible to any Grantor for any act or omission to act except for any act or omission to act as to which there is a final determination made in a judicial proceeding (in which proceeding the Collateral Agent has had an opportunity to be heard) which determination includes a specific finding that the subject act or omission to act had been grossly negligent, willful misconduct or in actual bad faith. The provisions of Section 5.2 shall in no event relieve any Grantor of any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or impose any obligation on the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to proceed in any particular manner with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof, or in any way limit the exercise by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party of any other or further right which it may have on the date of this Agreement or hereafter, whether hereunder, under any other Loan Document, by law or otherwise. SECTION 6 Remedies 6.1 Remedies upon Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, it is agreed that the Collateral Agent shall have in any jurisdiction in which enforcement hereof is sought, in addition to all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or other Applicable Law. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent shall include, without limitation, the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times: (a) With respect to any Collateral consisting of Accounts, General Intangibles (including Payment Intangibles), Letter-of-Credit Rights, Instruments, Chattel Paper, Documents, and Investment Property, the Collateral Agent may collect the Collateral with or without the taking of possession of any of the Collateral. (b) With respect to any Collateral consisting of Accounts, the Collateral Agent may (i) demand, collect and receive any amounts relating thereto, as the Collateral Agent may determine; (ii) commence and prosecute any actions in any court for the purposes of collecting any such Accounts and enforcing any other rights in respect thereof; (iii) defend, settle or compromise any action brought and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Collateral Agent may reasonably deem appropriate; (iv) without limiting the Collateral Agent's rights set forth in Section 5.2 -20- hereof, receive, open and dispose of mail addressed to any Grantor and endorse checks, notes, drafts, acceptances, money orders, bills of lading, warehouse receipts or other instruments or documents evidencing payment, shipment or storage of the goods giving rise to such Accounts or securing or relating to such Accounts, on behalf of and in the name of such Grantor; and (v) sell, assign, transfer, make any agreement in respect of, or otherwise deal with or exercise rights in respect of, any such Accounts or the goods or services which have given rise thereto, as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes. (c) With respect to any Collateral consisting of Investment Property, the Collateral Agent may (i) exercise all rights of any Grantor with respect thereto, including without limitation, the right to exercise all voting and corporate rights at any meeting of the shareholders of the Issuer of any Investment Property and to exercise any and all rights of conversion, exchange, subscription or any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to any Investment Property as if the Collateral Agent was the absolute owner thereof, including the right to exchange, at its discretion, any and all of any Investment Property upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other readjustment of the Issuer thereof, all without liability except to account for property actually received as provided in Section 5.3 hereof; (ii) transfer such Collateral at any time to itself, or to its nominee, and receive the income thereon and hold the same as Collateral hereunder or apply it to the Obligations; and (iii) demand, sue for, collect or make any compromise or settlement it deems desirable. The Grantors recognize that (a) the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of all or a part of the Investment Property by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. Section 77, (as amended and in effect, the "Securities Act") or the Securities laws of various states (the "Blue Sky Laws"), but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire the Investment Property for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, (b) that private sales so made may be at prices and upon other terms less favorable to the seller than if the Investment Property were sold at public sales, (c) that neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party has any obligation to delay sale of any of the Investment Property for the period of time necessary to permit the Investment Property to be registered for public sale under the Securities Act or the Blue Sky Laws, and (d) that private sales made under the foregoing circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. (d) With respect to any Collateral consisting of Inventory, Goods, and Equipment, the Collateral Agent may conduct one or more going out of business sales, in the Collateral Agent's own right or by one or more agents and contractors. Such sale(s) may be conducted upon any premises owned, leased, or occupied by any Grantor. The Collateral Agent and any such agent or contractor, in conjunction with any such sale, may augment the Inventory with other goods (all of which other goods shall remain the sole -21- property of the Collateral Agent or such agent or contractor). Any amounts realized from the sale of such goods which constitute augmentations to the Inventory (net of an allocable share of the costs and expenses incurred in their disposition) shall be the sole property of the Collateral Agent or such agent or contractor and neither any Grantor nor any Person claiming under or in right of any Grantor shall have any interest therein. Each purchaser at any such going out of business sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor. (e) With respect to any Collateral consisting of General Intangibles, the Collateral Agent may exercise all of the rights granted to the Collateral Agent under the IP Security Agreement. (f) With or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, the Collateral Agent may enter upon, occupy, and use any premises owned or occupied by each Grantor, and may exclude the Grantors from such premises or portion thereof as may have been so entered upon, occupied, or used by the Collateral Agent to the extent the Collateral Agent deems such exclusion reasonably necessary to preserve and protect the Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall not be required to remove any of the Collateral from any such premises upon the Collateral Agent's taking possession thereof, and may render any Collateral unusable to the Grantors. In no event shall the Collateral Agent be liable to any Grantor for use or occupancy by the Collateral Agent of any premises pursuant to this Section 6.1, nor for any charge (such as wages for the Grantors' employees and utilities) incurred in connection with the Collateral Agent's exercise of the Collateral Agent's Rights and Remedies (as defined herein) hereunder. (g) The Collateral Agent may require any Grantor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Collateral Agent at the Grantor's sole risk and expense at a place or places which are reasonably convenient to both the Collateral Agent and such Grantor. (h) Each Grantor agrees that the Collateral Agent shall have the right, subject to Applicable Law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral, at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor. (i) Unless the Collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value, or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market (in which event the Collateral Agent shall provide the Grantors such notice as may be practicable under the circumstances), the Collateral Agent shall give the Grantors at least ten (10) days' prior written notice, by authenticated record, of the date, time and place of any proposed public sale, and of the date after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral may be made. Each Grantor agrees that such written notice shall satisfy all requirements for notice to that Grantor which are imposed under the UCC or other Applicable Law -22- with respect to the exercise of the Collateral Agent's rights and remedies upon default. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale or other disposition of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. (j) Any public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale. At any sale or other disposition, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. If any of the Collateral is sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of by the Collateral Agent on credit, the Obligations shall not be deemed to have been reduced as a result thereof unless and until payment is finally received thereon by the Collateral Agent. (k) At any public (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 6.1, the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor, the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Party from any Grantor on account of the Obligations as a credit against the purchase price, and the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor. (l) For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof. The Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full. (m) As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the Collateral and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. (n) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Grantor hereby waives all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal which such Grantor now has or -23- may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. 6.2 Application of Proceeds. After the occurrence of an Event of Default and acceleration of the Obligations pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the Collateral, as well as any Collateral consisting of cash, or any Collateral granted under any other of the Security Documents as follows: FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Agents in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or any of the Obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Agents hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Grantor and any other reasonable costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder, under any other Loan Document; SECOND, to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest and principal on the Swingline Loans; THIRD, to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Revolving Loans; FOURTH, to the payment of outstanding principal on the Revolving Loans; FIFTH, to the Cash Collateral Account as collateral for Letter of Credit Outstandings up to 105% thereof; SIXTH, to the payment of all fees due to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks under the Loan Documents; SEVENTH, to the payment of all other Obligations of the Grantors (including, without limitation, any obligations under any Hedging Agreements); and EIGHTH, to the Grantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. Upon any sale or other disposition of the Collateral by the Collateral Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the Collateral Agent or of the officer making the sale or other disposition shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold or otherwise disposed of and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. -24- SECTION 7 Perfection of Security Interest 7.1 Perfection by Filing. This Agreement constitutes an authenticated record, and each Grantor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 2.1 and 5.2, to file one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to all or any part of the Collateral, in such filing offices as the Collateral Agent shall reasonably deem appropriate, and the Grantors shall pay the Collateral Agent's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith. Each Grantor hereby further agrees that a carbon, photographic, or other reproduction of this Agreement shall be sufficient as a Financing Statement and may be filed as a Financing Statement in any and all jurisdictions. 7.2 Savings Clause. Nothing contained in this Article VII shall be construed to narrow the scope of the Collateral Agent's Security Interest in any of the Collateral or the perfection or priority thereof or to impair or otherwise limit any of the Collateral Agent's Rights and Remedies hereunder except (and then only to the extent) as mandated by the UCC. SECTION 8 Miscellaneous 8.1 Notices. All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in Section 9.1 of the Credit Agreement. 8.2 Grant of Non-Exclusive License. Without limiting the rights of the Collateral Agent under the IP Security Agreement, each Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent a royalty free, non-exclusive, irrevocable license, which license shall be exercisable upon the existence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to use, apply, and affix any trademark, trade name, logo, or the like in which any Grantor now or hereafter has rights, such license being with respect to the Collateral Agent's exercise of the Collateral Agent's Rights and Remedies hereunder including, without limitation, in connection with any completion of the manufacture of Inventory or any sale or other disposition of Inventory. 8.3 Security Interest Absolute. All rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder, the Security Interest and all obligations of the Grantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any agreement with respect to any of the Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other agreement or instrument, (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or -25- departure from the Guaranty or any other guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Obligations, or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Grantor in respect of the Obligations or this Agreement. 8.4 Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Grantors herein and in any other Loan Document and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and the issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Agents, the Issuing Banks or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Loan Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the Obligations are outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. 8.5 Binding Effect; Several Agreement; Assignments. Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party, and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Grantors that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each Grantor and its respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon each Grantor and the Collateral Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of each Grantor, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Grantor shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein or in the Collateral (and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or the Credit Agreement.

The Grantors agree that any action commenced by any Grantor asserting any claim or counterclaim arising under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be brought solely in a court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or any federal court sitting therein as the Collateral Agent may elect in its sole discretion and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any such action. -29- (b) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.1. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. 8.14 Termination; Release of Collateral.

No material claim has been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use by any Grantor of any of the Intellectual Property owned by any Grantor or the validity or effectiveness of any of the Intellectual Property owned by any Grantor, nor does any Grantor know of any valid basis for any such claim, except as otherwise set forth in the Credit Agreement. To the knowledge of the Grantors, the use by the Grantors of the Intellectual Property does not infringe the rights of any Person in any material respect. No holding, decision or judgment has been rendered by any Governmental Authority which would limit, cancel or question the validity of, or any Grantor's rights in, any Intellectual Property in any respect that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the business or the property of any Grantor. 7 4.6 The Grantors shall give the Collateral Agent written notice (with reasonable detail) within ten (10) days following the occurrence of any of the following: (a) The Grantors' obtaining rights to, and filing applications for registration of, any new Intellectual Property, or otherwise acquiring ownership of any newly registered Intellectual Property (other than the Grantors' right to sell products containing the trademarks of others in the ordinary course of the Grantors' business). (b) The Grantors' becoming entitled to the benefit of any registered Intellectual Property whether as licensee or licensor (other than the Grantors' right to sell products containing the trademarks of others in the ordinary course of the Grantors' business). (c) The Grantors' entering into any new Licenses. (d) The Grantors' knowing or having reason to know, that any application or registration relating to any material Intellectual Property may become forfeited, abandoned or dedicated to the public, or of any adverse determination or development (including, without limitation, the institution of, or any such determination or development in, any proceeding in the PTO or any court or tribunal) regarding the Grantors' ownership of, or the validity of, any material Intellectual Property or the Grantors' right to register the same or to own and maintain the same. SECTION 5 Agreement Applies to Future Intellectual Property 5.1 The provisions of this Agreement shall automatically apply to any such additional property or rights described in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 4.6, above, all of which shall be deemed to be and treated as "Intellectual Property" within the meaning of this Agreement. 5.2 Upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent, the Grantors shall execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Collateral Agent may request to evidence the Collateral Agent's security interest in any Patent or Trademark and the goodwill and General Intangibles of the Grantors relating thereto or represented thereby (including, without limitation, filings with the PTO or any similar office), and the Grantors hereby constitute the Collateral Agent as their attorney-in-fact to execute and file all such writings for the foregoing purposes, all acts of such attorney being hereby ratified and confirmed; provided, however, the Collateral Agent's taking of such action shall not be a condition to the creation or perfection of the security interest created hereby. SECTION 6 Grantors' Rights To Enforce Intellectual Property 8 Prior to the Collateral Agent's giving of notice to the Grantors (i) following the occurrence of an Event of Default or (ii) pursuant to Section 6.1 below, the Grantors shall have the exclusive right to sue for past, present and future infringement of the Intellectual Property including the right to seek injunctions and/or money damages, in an effort by the Grantors to protect the Intellectual Property against encroachment by third parties, provided, however: 6.1 The Grantors first provide the Collateral Agent with written notice of the Grantors' intention to so sue for enforcement of any Intellectual Property. If, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Agent, the Grantors have failed to take appropriate action within sixty (60) days after such notice is given to Collateral Agent, upon notice to the Grantors, the Collateral Agent may (but shall not be required to) itself take such action in the name of the Grantors, with any damages recovered in such action, net of costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred, to be applied as provided in Section 6.2 of the Security Agreement. 6.2 Any money damages awarded or received by the Grantors on account of such suit (or the threat of such suit) shall constitute IP Collateral. 6.3 Following the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent, by notice to the Grantors may terminate or limit the Grantors' rights under this Section 6. SECTION 7 Collateral Agent's Actions To Protect Intellectual Property In the event of: (a) the Grantors' failure, within five (5) days of written notice from the Collateral Agent, to cure any failure by the Grantors to observe or perform any of the Grantors' covenants, agreements or other obligations hereunder; and/or (b) the occurrence and continuance of any other Event of Default, the Collateral Agent, acting in its own name or in that of the Grantors, may (but shall not be required to) act in the Grantors' place and stead and/or in the Collateral Agent's own right in connection therewith. SECTION 8 Rights Upon Default Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may exercise all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the State of New York, with respect to the Intellectual Property, in addition to which the Collateral Agent may sell, license, assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the Intellectual Property. Any person may conclusively rely upon an affidavit of an officer of the Collateral 9 Agent that an Event of Default has occurred and that the Collateral Agent is authorized to exercise such rights and remedies. SECTION 9 Collateral Agent As Attorney In Fact 9.1 The Grantors hereby irrevocably constitute and designate the Collateral Agent as and for the Grantors' attorney in fact, effective following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default: (a) To supplement and amend from time to time Exhibits A and B of this Agreement to include any new or additional Intellectual Property of the Grantors. (b) To exercise any of the rights and powers referenced herein. (c) To execute all such instruments, documents, and papers as the Collateral Agent determines to be appropriate in connection with the exercise of such rights and remedies and to cause the sale, license, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of the Intellectual Property. 9.2 The within grant of a power of attorney, being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated by a duly authorized officer of the Collateral Agent. 9.3 The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to do any of the acts or to exercise any of the powers authorized by Section 9.1, but if the Collateral Agent elects to do any such act or to exercise any of such powers, it shall not be accountable for more than it actually receives as a result of such exercise of power, and shall not be responsible to any Grantor for any act or omission to act except for any act or omission to act as to which there is a final determination made in a judicial proceeding (in which proceeding the Collateral Agent has had an opportunity to be heard) which determination includes a specific finding that the subject act or omission to act had been grossly negligent or in actual bad faith. SECTION 10 Collateral Agent's Rights Any use by the Collateral Agent of the Intellectual Property, as authorized hereunder in connection with the exercise of the Collateral Agent's rights and remedies under this Agreement and under the Credit Agreement shall be coextensive with the Grantors' rights thereunder and with respect thereto and without any liability for royalties or other related charges. 10 SECTION 11 Intent This Agreement is being executed and delivered by the Grantors for the purpose of registering and confirming the grant of the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the IP Collateral with the PTO. It is intended that the security interest granted pursuant to this Agreement is granted as a supplement to, and not in limitation of, the Security Interest granted to the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, under the Security Agreement. All provisions of the Security Agreement shall apply to the IP Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall have the same rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions with respect to the security interests created in the IP Collateral as in all other Collateral. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Security Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control with respect to the IP Collateral and the Security Agreement with respect to all other Collateral. SECTION 12 Governing Law THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

Property Leases and Revenues.

Grantor hereby represents and warrants as follows: (i) Grantor is the sole and absolute owner of the entire landlord's or lessor's interest in the Property Leases and said rents, issues and profits and shall not assign its interest in, to or under any of the Property Leases or the Revenues to any person or entity other than the Beneficiary; (ii) Grantor has made no prior assignment of any of the Property Leases or with respect to any of said rents, issues or profits; and (iii) Grantor has neither done any act nor omitted to do any act which might prevent Beneficiary from, or limit Beneficiary in, acting under any of the provisions of this assignment pursuant to this Deed of Trust. (b) Grantor agrees that neither the foregoing assignment of Property Leases and Revenues, nor the exercise of any of Beneficiary's rights and remedies under Paragraph 17 hereof shall be deemed to make Beneficiary a mortgagee-in-possession or otherwise responsible or liable in any manner with respect to the Property Leases, the Property or the use, occupancy, enjoyment or operation of all or any portion thereof, unless and until Beneficiary, in person or by agent, assumes actual possession thereof. Nor shall the appointment of any receiver for the Property by any court at the request of Beneficiary or by agreement with Grantor, or the entering into possession of any part of the Property by such receiver, be deemed to make Beneficiary a mortgagee-in-possession or otherwise responsible or liable in any manner with respect to the Property Leases, the Property or the use, occupancy, enjoyment or operation of all or any portion thereof. (c) If Beneficiary or a receiver enters upon, takes possession of and maintains control of the Property, all Revenues thereafter collected shall be 12 applied first to the costs of taking control of and managing the Property and collecting the Revenues, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees actually incurred, receiver's fees, premiums on receiver's bonds, costs of repairs to the Property, premiums on insurance policies, Impositions and other charges on the Property, and the costs of discharging any obligation or liability of Grantor as landlord, lessor or licensor of the Property and then to the Secured Obligations, in the manner set forth in the Credit Agreement.

If the Revenues are not sufficient to meet the costs of taking control of and managing the Property and collecting the Revenues, any monies expended by Beneficiary for such purposes shall become a portion of the Secured Obligations. Unless Beneficiary and Grantor agree in writing to other terms of payment, such amounts shall be payable upon notice from Beneficiary to Grantor requesting payment thereof and shall bear interest from the date of disbursement at the Default Rate, unless payment of interest at such rate would be contrary to applicable law, in which event such amounts shall bear interest at the highest rate which may be collected from Grantor under Applicable Law. The entering upon and taking possession of and maintaining of control of the Property by Beneficiary or the receiver pursuant to the provisions of this Deed of Trust and the application of Revenues as provided herein shall not cure or waive any Event of Default or invalidate any other right or remedy of Beneficiary hereunder. (d) At the Beneficiary's request, the Grantor shall enter into a Subordination, Nondisturbance and Attornment Agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Beneficiary with respect to all Property Leases with tenants of the Property which are not Affiliates of the Grantor. 13.

Grantor will not, without the consent of the Collateral Agent in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, enter into any Property Lease of all or any portion of the Property or amend, supplement or otherwise modify, or terminate or cancel, or accept the surrender of, or consent to the assignment or subletting of, or grant any concessions to or waive the performance of any obligations of any tenant, lessee or licensee under, any now existing or future Property Lease. Grantor agrees not to collect or accept the payment of any Revenues, or other income or profit from, or on account of, any use or occupancy of the Property, in advance of the time when such payment becomes due unless such amount is delivered to Beneficiary to be applied to the Secured Obligations, in the manner set forth in the Credit Agreement. 14. Remedies Cumulative. All remedies provided in this Deed of Trust are distinct and cumulative to any other right or remedy under this Deed of Trust or 13 under the other Loan Documents or afforded by law or equity, and may be exercised concurrently, independently or successively. 15. Taxation of Deeds of Trust. In the event of the enactment of any law deducting from the value of the Property any mortgage Lien thereon, or imposing upon Beneficiary the payment of all or part of the taxes, charges or assessments previously paid by Grantor pursuant to this Deed of Trust, or changing the law relating to the taxation of mortgages or debts secured by mortgages or Beneficiary's interest in the Property so as to impose new incidents of tax on Beneficiary, then Grantor shall pay such taxes or assessments or shall reimburse Beneficiary therefor. 16. Events of Default and Acceleration. The occurrence of any "Event of Default" as defined in the Credit Agreement shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Secured Obligations may be accelerated pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, whereupon the same shall become immediately due and payable, and without presentment, protest, demand or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Grantor. No omission to exercise such option when entitled to do so shall be construed as a waiver of such right. 17. Rights and Remedies. (a) Foreclosure and other Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, and whether or not Beneficiary shall have accelerated the maturity of the Secured Obligations pursuant to Paragraph 16 hereof, Trustee, at its option, may: (i) exercise the rights and remedies afforded under Paragraph 17(b) below, or exercise any of the following remedies to the extent available under the laws of the State of Texas; (ii) either with or without entering upon or taking possession of the Property, demand, collect and receive any or all Revenues; (iii) either with or without entering upon or taking possession of the Property, and without assuming any obligations of Grantor thereunder, exercise the rights of Grantor under, use or benefit from, any of the Property Leases; (iv) in person, by agent or by court-appointed receiver, enter upon, take possession of, and maintain full control of the Mortgaged Property in order to perform all acts necessary or appropriate to maintain and operate the Mortgaged Property, including, but not limited to, the execution, cancellation or modification of Property Leases, the making of repairs to the Property and the execution or termination of contracts 14 providing for the management or maintenance of the Property, all on such terms as Trustee, in its sole discretion, deems proper or appropriate; (v) proceed by a suit or suits in law or in equity or by other appropriate proceeding to enforce payment of the Secured Obligations or the performance of any term, covenant, condition or agreement of this Deed of Trust or the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any other right, and to pursue any other remedy available to it, all as Trustee shall determine most effectual for such purposes; (vi) institute and maintain such suits and proceedings as Trustee may deem expedient to prevent any impairment of the Mortgaged Property by any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of this Deed of Trust, to preserve or protects its interest in the Mortgaged Property and the Revenues, and to restrain the enforcement of or compliance with any legislation or other governmental enactment, rule or order that would impair the security hereunder or be prejudicial to the interest of Trustee; (vii) apply all or any portion of the Mortgaged Property, or the proceeds thereof, towards (but not necessarily in complete satisfaction of) the Secured Obligations, in the manner set forth in the Credit Agreement or the Security Agreement, as applicable; (viii) foreclose any and all rights of Grantor in and to the Property, whether by sale, entry or in any other manner provided for hereunder or under the laws of the State of Texas; (ix) in the case of any receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other proceedings affecting Grantor or the creditors or property of Grantor, Beneficiary, to the extent permitted by law, shall be entitled to file such proofs of claim and other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of Beneficiary allowed in such proceedings for the entire amount of the Secured Obligations at the date of the institution of such proceedings and for any additional portion of the Secured Obligations accruing after such date; (x) exercise any other right or remedy of a mortgagee or secured party under the laws of the State of Texas. (b) Rights of Beneficiary and Trustee. i. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, it shall thereupon, or at any time thereafter while any part of the Secured Obligations remain undischarged, be the duty of the Trustee, or his successors, as hereinafter provided, at the request of Beneficiary (which request shall be presumed), to enforce this Trust and to sell the Property, as 15 an entirety or in parcels, by one sale or by several sales, held at one time or at different times, all as the Trustee acting may elect, each sale to be held in the area of the county courthouse designated for the conduct of foreclosure sales in any county in which a part of the real property to be sold is situated and to be made on the first Tuesday of some month between the hours of 10 o'clock a.m. and 4 o'clock p.m. to the highest bidder for cash at public venue, after the Trustee and Beneficiary shall have given notices of the proposed sale in the manner hereinafter set forth, and to make due conveyance to the purchaser or purchasers, with general warranty of title to such purchaser or purchasers binding upon Grantor and its successors. Grantor, for itself and assigns, hereby expressly and specifically waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of Grantor, including the Property, or to a sale in inverse order of alienation. ii. The Trustee shall give notice of each such proposed sale by posting written notice of the time, place and terms of sale at the courthouse door, and by filing a copy of such written notice in the office of the county in which the sale is to be made, at least twenty one (21) consecutive days preceding the date of the sale. Where real properties to be sold are situated in more than one county, one notice shall be posted at the courthouse door, and a copy of such notice shall be filed with the county clerk, of each county, in which a part of the real properties to be sold is situated, and such notices shall designate the county where such real properties will be sold, which may be any county in which a part of said real properties is situated. In addition to the foregoing notice or notices to be posted and filed by the Trustee, the mortgage servicer of the debt to which the power of sale is related (the "Mortgage Servicer") shall, at least twenty one (21) days preceding the date of sale, serve or cause to be served written notice of the proposed sale by certified mail on each debtor obligated to pay such debt according to the records of such Mortgage Servicer. The service of such notice shall be completed upon deposit of the notice, enclosed in a prepaid wrapper, properly addressed to each such debtor at the last known address, in a post office or official depository under the care and custody of the United States Postal Service. The affidavit of any person having knowledge of the facts to the effect that such service was completed shall be prima facie evidence of the fact of service. In this respect and to the full extent permitted by law, Grantor also expressly covenants, stipulates and agrees 16 that: (i) the address of Grantor set forth on the first page of this Deed of Trust shall be deemed and considered conclusively to be and remain at all times that last known address of all debtors obligated to pay such debt as shown by the records of the Mortgage Servicer, provided such address may be changed from time to time only by express written notice of change thereof signed by all debtors obligated to pay such debt and actually delivered to and received by Mortgage Servicer and setting forth a new address which shall be within the United States of America and which shall be deemed and considered conclusively to be and remain at all times thereafter the most recent address of all debtors obligated to pay such debt as shown by the records of Mortgage Servicer until changed in the manner herein provided, (ii) the records of Mortgage Servicer shall not be deemed to reflect any change in the name or identity of the debtors obligated to pay the debt (to whom notice of a proposed sale shall be required to be mailed as provided for above) unless and until express written notice of such change signed by all debtors obligated to pay such debt shall have been actually delivered to and received by Mortgage Servicer, and (iii) no notice of such sale or sales other than the notices hereinabove provided shall be required to be given to Grantor or any other persons and any other notice is expressly waived. iii. The provisions of Subparagraph 17(b)ii above with respect to posting, serving, filing and giving notices of sale are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 51.002 of the Property Code of the State of Texas as in effect on the date hereof (the "Subject Statutes"). In the event the requirement for any notice, or the posting, serving, filing or giving thereof, under the Subject Statutes shall be eliminated or the prescribed manner of posting, serving, filing or giving same is modified by future amendment to the Subject Statutes, the requirement for such particular notice shall be stricken from, or the manner of posting, serving, filing or giving any notice hereunder modified in, this instrument in conformity with such amendment. The manner herein prescribed for posting, serving, filing or giving any notice, other than that to be posted and filed or caused to be posted and filed by the Trustee, shall not be deemed exclusive but such notice or notices may be posted, served, filed or given in any other manner which may be permitted by applicable law. Further, in relation to this Deed of Trust and the exercise of any power of sale by the Trustee hereunder, if either the Subject Statutes shall be 17 amended or modified to require any other notice of the posting, filing, serving or giving thereof or any statute hereafter enacted shall require any other notice or the posting, filing, serving or giving thereof, the Trustee or the person selected by him is hereby authorized and empowered by Grantor to give such notice provided, however, Grantor waives such other notice or the posting, filing, serving or giving thereof to the full extent Grantor may lawfully so do. iv. At any sale conducted under this instrument, credit upon all or any part of the Secured Obligations shall be deemed cash paid for the purpose of Subparagraph 17(b)i above; and the holder of all or any part of the Secured Obligations may purchase at any such sale. With the proceeds arising from such sale or sales, the Trustee shall first pay all expenses of advertising, sale and conveyance, including a reasonable Trustee's fee (not to exceed five percent (5%) of the gross proceeds of such sale or sales) to the Trustee acting, and shall next apply such proceeds toward the discharge and payment of the Secured Obligations (including principal, interest and attorney's fees, if any), and the remaining balance, if any, shall be paid to Grantor. v. Without limiting any of the powers or remedies provided elsewhere, Grantor agrees that in the event the Secured Obligations are payable in installments or include, at any time, items of matured as well as unmatured indebtedness, the holder of the matured installments or items of indebtedness, as the case may be, shall have the right to have the Property sold subject to the part of the Secured Obligations which is unmatured at the time the Trustee is requested to make such sale, at Trustee's sale to satisfy the lien and security interest hereof securing the then matured portion of said indebtedness and the Trustee is expressly authorized and empowered to conduct such sale which is called herein an "Installment Foreclosure." Any Installment Foreclosure made hereunder shall not affect the liens, assignments and security interest of this Deed of Trust existing to secure that portion of the Secured Obligations to which the sale is to be made subject. No Installment Foreclosure shall exhaust the power of the Trustee to conduct future Installment Foreclosures nor in anywise limit the powers of sale provided elsewhere in this Deed of Trust. The provisions elsewhere in this Deed of Trust relating to manner of conducting Trustee's sales, including the posting, filing and giving of notices thereof, 18 shall also apply to any Installment Foreclosure and the same presumptions shall be applicable to any Trustee's deed or recital therein contained in connection with an Installment Foreclosure and to any other affidavit as hereinafter provided. vi. In the case of the absence of the Trustee from the State of Texas, or of his death, inability, refusal or failure to act, or in the event the Beneficiary should elect at any time (with or without cause) to remove the Trustee then acting, a successor or substitute may be named, constituted and appointed by the Beneficiary, without further formality than an appointment and designation in writing, which appointment and designation shall be full evidence of the right and authority to make the same and of all facts therein recited; and this conveyance shall vest in the Successor or Substitute Trustee the title, powers and duties conferred on the Trustee named herein and the conveyance by the Successor or Substitute Trustee to the purchaser at any sale made pursuant hereto shall be valid and effective as fully as hereinabove provided in the case of a conveyance by the Trustee. Such right to appoint a Successor or Substitute Trustee shall exist as often as and whenever the Trustee, original, successor or substitute, cannot or will not act or has been removed by Beneficiary. Grantor specifically covenants and stipulates that: the recitals in the conveyance made to the purchaser, either by the Trustee or any Successor or Substitute Trustee, shall be full proof and evidence of the matters therein stated; no other proof shall be requisite of the request by the holder of the Secured Obligations on the Trustee or on any Successor or Substitute Trustee to enforce this trust, or of the due, timely and proper posting, filing and giving of all notices and making of the sale, or any particulars thereof, or of the in ability, refusal or failure of the Trustee, or any Successor or Substitute Trustee, to act, or of the removal of the Trustee or any Successor or Substitute Trustee, as herein provided, either as to the legality of his appointment or otherwise, or of the contingencies which brought about the failure or inability of the Trustee or any Successor or Substitute Trustee to act, or of his removal, as the case may be; all pre requisites of said sale shall be presumed to have been performed; and any such sale made under the powers herein granted shall be a perpetual bar against Grantor, its successors and assigns. 19 vii. The right of sale hereunder shall not be exhausted by one or any sale, but so long as any of the Secured Obligations remain undischarged, the Trustee or successor or Substitute Trustee may make other and successive sales until all the Property shall be legally sold. viii. The Beneficiary shall have the power and authority to institute and maintain any suits and proceedings as the Beneficiary may deem advisable (i) to prevent any impairment of the Property by any acts which may be unlawful or any violation of this Deed of Trust, (ii) to preserve or protect its interest in the Property, and (iii) to restrain the enforcement of or compliance with any legislation or other governmental enactment, rule or order that may be unconstitutional or order that may be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, if the enforcement of or compliance with such enactment, rule or order might impair the security hereunder or be prejudicial to the Beneficiary's interest. ix. In the case of any receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition, or other judicial proceedings affecting the Grantor or any guarantor, co maker or endorser of any of the Grantor's obligations, its creditors or its property, the Beneficiary, to the extent permitted by law, shall be entitled to file such proofs of claim and other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have its claims allowed in such proceedings for the entire amount due and payable by the Grantor under the Notes, this Deed of Trust and any other instrument securing the Notes, at the date of the institution of such proceedings, and for any additional amounts which may become due and payable by the Grantor after such date. x. In case of a foreclosure sale of all or any part of the Property and of the application of the proceeds of sale to the payment of the sums secured hereby, the Beneficiary shall, unless precluded under the Notes from seeking a deficiency judgment against the Grantor, be entitled to enforce payment from the Grantor of all amounts then remaining due and unpaid and to recover judgment against the Grantor for any portion thereof remaining unpaid, with interest. (c) Receiver. If an Event of Default shall have occurred Beneficiary, upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be entitled as a matter 20 of strict right without notice and without regard to the occupancy or value of any security for the Secured Obligations or the solvency of any party bound for its payment, to the appointment of a receiver to take possession of the Mortgaged Property and to operate the Property and to collect and apply the Revenues. The receiver shall have all of the rights and powers permitted under the laws of the State of Texas. Grantor will pay to Beneficiary upon demand, all expenses, including receiver's fees, attorneys' fees, costs and agent's compensation, incurred pursuant to such appointment and all such expenses shall be a portion of the Secured Obligations. (d) Sale or Other Disposition of Mortgaged Property. Grantor waives any right to require the marshaling of any of its assets in connection with any disposition conducted pursuant hereto. In the event all or part of the Mortgaged Property is included at any foreclosure sale conducted pursuant hereto, a single total price for the Mortgaged Property, or such part thereof as is sold, may be accepted by Beneficiary with no obligation to distinguish between the application of such proceeds amongst the property comprising the Mortgaged Property. (e) Collection of Revenues. In connection with the exercise by Beneficiary of the rights and remedies provided for in subparagraph (a)(ii) of this Paragraph 17: (i) Beneficiary may notify any tenant, lessee or licensee of the Property, either in the name of Beneficiary or Grantor, to make payment of Revenues directly to Beneficiary or Beneficiary's agents, may advise any person of Beneficiary's interest in and to the Revenues, and may collect directly from such tenants, lessees and licensees all amounts due on account of the Revenues; (ii) At Beneficiary's request, Grantor will provide written notification to any or all tenants, lessees and licensees of the Property concerning Beneficiary's interest in the Revenues and will request that such tenants, lessees and licensees forward payment thereof directly to Beneficiary; (iii) Grantor shall hold any proceeds and collections of any of the Revenues in trust for Beneficiary and shall not commingle such proceeds or collections with any other funds of Grantor; and (iv) Grantor shall deliver all such proceeds to Beneficiary immediately upon the receipt thereof by Grantor in the identical form received, but duly endorsed or assigned on behalf of Grantor to Beneficiary. (f) Use and Occupation of Property. In connection with the exercise of the Beneficiary's rights under Subparagraph (a)(v) of this Paragraph 17, Beneficiary may enter upon, occupy, and use all or any part of the Property and 21 may exclude Grantor from the Land and the Improvements or portion thereof as may have been so entered upon, occupied, or used. In the event Beneficiary manages the Land and the Improvements in accordance with Subparagraph (a)(vi) herein, Grantor shall pay to Beneficiary on demand a reasonable fee for the management thereof in addition to the Secured Obligations. Further, Beneficiary may make such alterations, renovations, repairs, and replacements to the Improvements, as Beneficiary, in its sole discretion, deems proper or appropriate. The obligation of Grantor to pay such amounts and all expenses incurred by Beneficiary in the exercise of its rights hereunder shall be included in the Secured Obligations and shall accrue interest at the Default Rate, unless collection from Grantor of interest at such rate would be contrary to applicable law, in which event such amounts shall bear interest at the highest rate which may be collected from Grantor under applicable law. (g) Partial Sales. Grantor agrees that in case Beneficiary, in the exercise of the power of sale contained herein or in the exercise of any other rights hereunder given, elects to sell in parts or parcels, said sales may be held from time to time and that the power shall not be exhausted until all of the Mortgaged Property not previously sold shall have been sold, notwithstanding that the proceeds of such sales exceed, or may exceed, the Secured Obligations. (h) Assembly of Mortgaged Property. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Beneficiary may require Grantor to assemble that portion of the Mortgaged Property consisting of personal property and make it available to Beneficiary, at Grantor's sole risk and expense, at a place or places to be designated by Beneficiary which are reasonably convenient to both Beneficiary and Grantor. (i) Power of Attorney. Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Beneficiary as Grantor's true and lawful attorney in fact, exercisable only after the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to take any action with respect to the Mortgaged Property to preserve, protect, or realize upon Beneficiary's interest therein, each at the sole risk, cost and expense of Grantor, but for the sole benefit of Beneficiary. The rights and powers granted Beneficiary by the within appointment include, but are not limited to, the right and power to: (i) prosecute, defend, compromise, settle, or release any action relating to the Mortgaged Property; (ii) endorse the name of Grantor in favor of Beneficiary upon any and all checks or other items constituting Revenues; (iii) enter into leases or subleases relative to all or a portion of the Land or the Improvements; (iv) enter into any contracts or agreements relative to, and to take all action deemed necessary in connection with, the construction of any Improvements on the Land; (v) manage, operate, maintain, or repair the Land and the Improvements pursuant to Contracts or otherwise; and (vi) exercise the rights of Grantor under any Property Leases or any Contracts. Beneficiary shall not be obligated to perform any of such acts or to exercise any of such powers, but if Beneficiary elects so to perform or exercise, Beneficiary shall not be accountable for more than it actually receives as a result of such exercise of power, and shall 22 not be responsible to Grantor except for Beneficiary's willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. All powers conferred upon Beneficiary by this Deed of Trust (which shall only be exercised only after the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default), being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable until terminated by a written instrument executed by a duly authorized officer of Beneficiary. 18. Notices. Any and all notices, demands, elections or requests provided for or permitted to be given pursuant to this Deed of Trust shall be given or served as provided in Section 9.1 of the Credit Agreement. 19. Successors and Assigns Bound; Captions. The covenants and agreements herein contained shall bind, and the rights hereunder shall inure to, the respective successors and assigns of Beneficiary and Grantor, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6 hereof. The captions and headings of the paragraphs of this Deed of Trust are for convenience only and are not to be used to interpret or define the provisions hereof. 20. Governing Law; Severability. This Deed of Trust and the obligations of Grantor hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted and determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New York except that the creation, governance, administration and enforcement of Liens and rights and remedies with respect to the Property shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. In the event that any provision or clause of this Deed of Trust or any other Loan Document conflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Deed of Trust or such Loan Document which can be given effect without the conflicting provision, and to this end, the provisions of this Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents are declared to be severable. In the event that any Applicable Law limiting the amount of interest or other charges permitted to be collected from Grantor is interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final order so that any charge for which provision is made in this Deed of Trust or in the other Loan Documents, whether considered separately or together with other charges permitted to be collected from Grantor, is interpreted so that any such charge, whether considered separately or together with other charges that are considered a part of the transaction represented by this Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents, violates such law, and Grantor is entitled to the benefit of such law, such charge is hereby reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate such violation. The amounts, if any, previously paid to Beneficiary in excess of the amounts payable to Beneficiary pursuant to such charges as reduced shall be applied by Beneficiary to reduce the principal of the Secured Obligations. 21. Discharge. This Agreement shall terminate and the Beneficiary shall discharge this Deed of Trust when all the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, the Lenders have no further commitment to lend, there are no Letter of Credit Outstandings and the Issuing Banks have no further 23 commitment to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement. Grantor shall pay Beneficiary's reasonable costs incurred in discharging this Deed of Trust. 22. Waivers. (i) Grantor agrees to the full extent permitted by law, that in case of an Event of Default hereunder, neither Grantor nor anyone claiming through or under Grantor shall or will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, homestead, exemption or redemption laws now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement or foreclosure of this Deed of Trust, or the absolute sale of the Mortgaged Property, or the final and absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the purchasers thereat, and Grantor, for Grantor and all who may at any time claim through or under Grantor, hereby waives to the fullest extent that Grantor may lawfully so do, the benefit of all such laws, and any and all right to have the assets comprised in the security intended to be created hereby marshaled upon any foreclosure of the Lien hereof. (ii) No failure or delay of the Collateral Agent in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Beneficiary hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the Beneficiary would otherwise have. No waiver of any provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by Grantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (c) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on the Grantor in any case shall entitle the Grantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (iii) Neither this Deed of Trust nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Beneficiary and the Grantor with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.2 of the Credit Agreement. (iv) In the event of the sale or transfer by operation of law or otherwise of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property, Beneficiary, without notice, is hereby authorized and empowered to deal with any such vendee or transferee with reference to the Mortgaged Property or the Secured Obligations or with reference to any of the terms, covenants, conditions or agreements hereof, as fully and to the same extent as it might deal with the original parties hereto and without in any way releasing or discharging any liabilities, obligations or undertakings (including, without limitation, the restrictions upon transfer contained in Paragraph 5). 24 (v) In the event an interest in any of the Property is foreclosed upon pursuant to a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale, Grantor agrees as follows: notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 51.003, 51.004, and 51.005 of the Texas Property Code (as the same may be amended from time to time), and to the extent permitted by law, Grantor agrees that Beneficiary shall be entitled to seek a deficiency judgment from Grantor and any other party obligated on the Credit Extensions equal to the difference between the amount owing on the Credit Extensions and the amount for which the Mortgaged Property was sold pursuant to judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale. Grantor expressly recognizes that this section constitutes a waiver of the above-cited provisions of the Texas Property Code which would otherwise permit Grantor and other Persons against whom recovery of deficiencies is sought or Grantor independently (even absent the initiation of deficiency proceedings against them) to present competent evidence of the fair market value of the Mortgaged Property as of the date of the foreclosure sale and offset against and deficiency the amount by which the foreclosure sale price is determined to be less than such fair market value. Grantor further recognizes and agrees that this waiver creates an irrebuttable presumption that the foreclosure sale price is equal to the fair market value of the Property for purposes of calculating deficiencies owed by Grantor, Guarantor, and others against whom recovery of a deficiency is sought. (vi) Neither Beneficiary nor any affiliate of Beneficiary has made any representation, warranty or statement to Grantor in order to induce Grantor to execute this Deed of Trust. Grantor hereby expressly waives any claim of fraudulent inducement to execute this Deed of Trust and further disclaims any reliance or statements on or representations of Beneficiary in waiving such claim. 23. Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time, upon request by the Collateral Agent, Grantor will make, execute and deliver, or cause to be made, executed and delivered, to the Collateral Agent and, where appropriate, cause to be recorded and/or filed and from time to time thereafter to be re-recorded and/or refiled at such time and in such offices and places as shall be deemed desirable by the Collateral Agent, any and all such other and further assignments, mortgages, security agreements, financing statements, continuation statements, instruments of further assurance, certificates and other documents as may, in the opinion of the Collateral Agent, be necessary or desirable in order to effectuate, complete, or perfect, or to continue and preserve (a) the obligations of Grantor under this Deed of Trust, and (b) the Lien created by this Deed of Trust upon the Mortgaged Property. Upon any failure by Grantor so to do, Beneficiary may make, execute, record, file, re-record and/or refile any and all such assignments, mortgages, security agreements, financing statements, continuation statements, instruments, certificates, and documents for and in the name of Grantor, and Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints Beneficiary the agent and attorney in fact of Grantor so to do. 25 24. Subrogation. Beneficiary shall be subrogated to all right, title, Lien or equity of all persons to whom Beneficiary may have paid any monies in settlement of Liens or in acquisition of title or for its benefit hereunder, or for the benefit or account of Grantor or subsequently paid under any provisions hereof. 25. Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to each and every covenant, agreement and obligation of Grantor under this Deed of Trust and any and all other Loan Documents. 26. Beneficiary's Fees and Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Without in anyway limiting any other reimbursement obligations contained under the other Loan Documents, the Grantor agrees to pay upon demand to the Beneficiary the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of its counsel and of any experts or agents, which the Beneficiary may incur in connection with the exercise, enforcement or protection of any of the rights of the Beneficiary hereunder. (b) Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other Loan Documents, the Grantor agrees to indemnify the Beneficiary and the other Indemnitees against, and hold each of them harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel, incurred by or asserted against any of them arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of, the execution, delivery or performance of this Deed of Trust or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating hereto or to the Mortgaged Property, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. (c) Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Secured Obligations secured hereby and by the other Security Documents. The provisions of this Paragraph 26 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Deed of Trust or any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Secured Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Deed of Trust or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Beneficiary or any Secured Party. All amounts due under this Paragraph 26 shall be payable on written demand therefor. 27. Submission to Jurisdiction. GRANTOR AGREES THAT ANY SUIT FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS DEED OF TRUST MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN OR ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING THEREIN AS THE BENEFICIARY MAY ELECT IN ITS SOLE 26 DISCRETION AND CONSENTS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. GRANTOR AND BENEFICIARY (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THIS DEED OF TRUST) EACH HEREBY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT OR ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH SUIT IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM AND AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. NOTHING IN THIS DEED OF TRUST OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT BENEFICIARY MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS DEED OF TRUST AGAINST BENEFICIARY OR ITS PROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION. GRANTOR AGREES THAT ANY ACTION COMMENCED BY GRANTOR ASSERTING ANY CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS DEED OF TRUST OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT SOLELY IN A COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN OR ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING THEREIN AS THE BENEFICIARY MAY ELECT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AND CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH ACTION.

From time to time, without affecting the obligation of Mortgagor or Mortgagor's successors or assigns to pay the Secured Obligations and to observe the covenants of Mortgagor contained in this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, and without affecting the guaranty of any Person, for payment or performance of the Secured Obligations, and without affecting the Lien or priority of Lien of this Mortgage on the Mortgaged Property, the Collateral Agent may, at the Collateral Agent's option, without giving notice to or obtaining the consent of Mortgagor, Mortgagor's successors or assigns or of any Facility Guarantor, and without liability on any Secured Party's part, but subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, grant extensions or postponements of the time for payment of the Secured Obligations or any part thereof, release anyone liable on any of the Secured Obligations, accept a renewal note or notes therefor, release from this Mortgage any part of the Mortgaged Property, take or release other or additional security, reconvey any part of the Mortgaged Property, consent to any map or plat or subdivision of the Property, consent to the granting of any easement, join in any extension or subordination agreement and agree in writing with Mortgagor to modify the terms and conditions of any Loan Document. Mortgagor shall pay such title insurance premiums and attorneys' fees as may be incurred, at the Collateral Agent's option, for any such action if taken at Mortgagor's request. 11. Forbearance Not Waiver. Any forbearance by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise afforded by Applicable Law, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder. The procurement of insurance or the payment of taxes or other Liens by the Collateral Agent shall not be a waiver of the Collateral Agent's right to accelerate the maturity of the Secured Obligations. The Collateral Agent's receipt of any awards, proceeds or damages under Paragraphs 3 and 9 hereof shall not operate to cure or waive Mortgagor's default in payment of the Secured Obligations. 12. Property Leases and Revenues. (a) As part of the consideration for the Secured Obligations, Mortgagor has absolutely and unconditionally collaterally assigned and transferred to Collateral Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties all of 11 Mortgagor's right, title and interest in and to the Property Leases and the Revenues, including those now due, past due or to become due by virtue of any Property Lease for the occupancy or use of all or any part of the Property. Mortgagor hereby represents and warrants as follows: (i) Mortgagor is the sole and absolute owner of the entire landlord's or lessor's interest in the Property Leases and said rents, issues and profits and shall not assign its interest in, to or under any of the Property Leases or the Revenues to any person or entity other than the Collateral Agent; (ii) Mortgagor has made no prior assignment of any of the Property Leases or with respect to any of said rents, issues or profits; and (iii) Mortgagor has neither done any act nor omitted to do any act which might prevent Collateral Agent from, or limit Collateral Agent in, acting under any of the provisions of this assignment pursuant to this Mortgage. (b) Mortgagor agrees that neither the foregoing assignment of Property Leases and Revenues, nor the exercise of any of Collateral Agent's rights and remedies under Paragraph 17 hereof shall be deemed to make Collateral Agent a mortgagee-in-possession or otherwise responsible or liable in any manner with respect to the Property Leases, the Property or the use, occupancy, enjoyment or operation of all or any portion thereof, unless and until Collateral Agent, in person or by agent, assumes actual possession thereof. Nor shall the appointment of any receiver for the Property by any court at the request of Collateral Agent or by agreement with Mortgagor, or the entering into possession of any part of the Property by such receiver, be deemed to make Collateral Agent a Collateral Agent-in-possession or otherwise responsible or liable in any manner with respect to the Property Leases, the Property or the use, occupancy, enjoyment or operation of all or any portion thereof. (c) If the Collateral Agent or a receiver enters upon, takes possession of and maintains control of the Property, all Revenues thereafter collected shall be applied first to the costs of taking control of and managing the Property and collecting the Revenues, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees actually incurred, receiver's fees, premiums on receiver's bonds, costs of repairs to the Property, premiums on insurance policies, Impositions and other charges on the Property, and the costs of discharging any obligation or liability of Mortgagor as landlord, lessor or licensor of the Property and then to the Secured Obligations, in the manner set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Agent and/ or the receiver shall have access to the books and records used in the operation and maintenance of the Property and shall be liable to account only for those Revenues actually received. The Collateral Agent shall not be liable to Mortgagor, anyone claiming under or through Mortgagor or anyone having an interest in the Property by reason of anything done or left undone by Collateral Agent pursuant to Paragraph 17 hereof. If the Revenues are not sufficient to meet the costs of taking control of and managing the Property and collecting the 12 Revenues, any monies expended by the Collateral Agent for such purposes shall become a portion of the Secured Obligations. Unless the Collateral Agent and Mortgagor agree in writing to other terms of payment, such amounts shall be payable upon notice from the Collateral Agent to Mortgagor requesting payment thereof and shall bear interest from the date of disbursement at the Default Rate, unless payment of interest at such rate would be contrary to applicable law, in which event such amounts shall bear interest at the highest rate which may be collected from Mortgagor under Applicable Law. The entering upon and taking possession of and maintaining of control of the Property by the Collateral Agent or the receiver pursuant to the provisions of this Mortgage and the application of Revenues as provided herein shall not cure or waive any Event of Default or invalidate any other right or remedy of the Collateral Agent hereunder. (d) At the Collateral Agent's request, the Mortgagor shall enter into a Subordination, Nondisturbance and Attornment Agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Collateral Agent with respect to all Property Leases with tenants of the Property which are not Affiliates of the Mortgagor. 13. Property Leases and Collection of Revenues. Mortgagor will not, without the consent of the Collateral Agent in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, enter into any Property Lease of all or any portion of the Property or amend, supplement or otherwise modify, or terminate or cancel, or accept the surrender of, or consent to the assignment or subletting of, or grant any concessions to or waive the performance of any obligations of any tenant, lessee or licensee under, any now existing or future Property Lease. Mortgagor agrees not to collect or accept the payment of any Revenues, or other income or profit from, or on account of, any use or occupancy of the Property, in advance of the time when such payment becomes due unless such amount is delivered to the Collateral Agent to be applied to the Secured Obligations, in the manner set forth in the Credit Agreement. 14. Remedies Cumulative. All remedies provided in this Mortgage are distinct and cumulative to any other right or remedy under this Mortgage or under the other Loan Documents or afforded by law or equity, and may be exercised concurrently, independently or successively. 15. Taxation of Mortgages. In the event of the enactment of any law deducting from the value of the Property any mortgage Lien thereon, or imposing upon the Collateral Agent the payment of all or part of the taxes, charges or assessments previously paid by Mortgagor pursuant to this Mortgage, or changing the law relating to the taxation of mortgages or debts secured by mortgages or the Collateral Agent's interest in the Property so as to impose new incidents of tax on the Collateral Agent, then Mortgagor shall pay such taxes or assessments or shall reimburse the Collateral Agent therefor. 16. Events of Default and Acceleration. The occurrence of any "Event of Default" as defined in the Credit Agreement, or the delivery of notice from 13 Mortgagor pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. 8143 electing to limit the indebtedness secured hereunder, shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Secured Obligations may be accelerated pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, whereupon the same shall become immediately due and payable, and without presentment, protest, demand or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Mortgagor. No omission to exercise such option when entitled to do so shall be construed as a waiver of such right. 17. Rights and Remedies. (a) Foreclosure and other Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, and whether or not the Collateral Agent shall have accelerated the maturity of the Secured Obligations pursuant to Paragraph 16 hereof, the Collateral Agent, at its option, may: (i) institute an action of mortgage foreclosure whether by sale, entry or in any other manner provided for hereunder or under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or take such other action at law or in equity for the enforcement of this Mortgage and realization on the Mortgaged Property or any other security herein or elsewhere provided for, as the Applicable Law may allow, and may proceed therein to final judgment and execution for the entire unpaid balance of the principal debt, with interest at the rate(s) stipulated in the Credit Agreement, together with all other sums due from Mortgagor and the other Borrowers in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement and this Mortgage, including all sums which may have been loaned by the Collateral Agent or Lenders to Mortgagor and the other Borrowers after the date of this Mortgage, all sums which may have been advanced by the Collateral Agent or Lenders for taxes, water, or sewer rents, other lienable charges or claims, insurance or repairs or maintenance after the date of this Mortgage (including the period after the entry of any judgment in mortgage foreclosure or other judgment entered pursuant to this Mortgage or any other Loan Document), and all costs of suit, including counsel fees. Mortgagor authorizes the Collateral Agent at its option to foreclose this Mortgage, subject to the rights of any tenants under the Property Leases, and the failure to make any such tenants parties defendant to any such foreclosure proceedings and to foreclose their rights will not be asserted by Mortgagor as a defense to any proceedings instituted by Collateral Agent to recover the indebtedness secured hereby or any deficiency remaining unpaid after the foreclosure sale of the Property; however, nothing herein contained shall prevent Mortgagor from asserting in any proceedings disputing the amount of the deficiency or the sufficiency of any bid at such foreclosure sale that any such tenants adversely affect the value of the Property; (ii) either with or without entering upon or taking possession of the Property, demand, collect and receive any or all Revenues; (iii) either with or without entering upon or taking possession of the Property, and without assuming any obligations of Mortgagor thereunder, exercise the rights of Mortgagor under, use or benefit from, any of the Property Leases; (iv) in person, by agent or by court-appointed receiver, enter upon, take possession of, and maintain full control of the Mortgaged Property in order to perform all acts necessary or appropriate to maintain and operate the Mortgaged Property, including, but not limited to, the execution, cancellation or modification of Property Leases, the making of repairs to the Property and the execution or termination of contracts providing for the management or maintenance of the Property, all on such terms as the Collateral Agent, in its sole discretion, deems proper or appropriate; (v) proceed by a suit or suits in law or in equity or by other appropriate proceeding to enforce payment of the Secured Obligations or the performance of any term, covenant, condition or agreement of this Mortgage or the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any other right, and to pursue any other remedy available to it, all as the Collateral Agent shall determine most effectual for such purposes; (vi) institute and maintain such suits and proceedings as the Collateral Agent may deem expedient to prevent any impairment of the Mortgaged Property by any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of this Mortgage, to preserve or protects its interest in the Mortgaged Property and the Revenues, and to restrain the enforcement of or compliance with any legislation or other governmental enactment, rule or order that would impair the security hereunder or be prejudicial to the interest of the Collateral Agent; (vii) apply all or any portion of the Mortgaged Property, or the proceeds thereof, towards (but not necessarily in complete satisfaction of) the Secured Obligations, in the manner set forth in the Credit Agreement or the Security Agreement, as applicable; (viii) have judgment entered pursuant to any power to confess judgment contained in this Mortgage; (ix) exercise any other right or remedy of a mortgagee or Secured Party under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. (b) Receiver. If an Event of Default shall have occurred, the Collateral Agent, upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be entitled as a matter of strict right without notice and without regard to the 15 occupancy or value of any security for the Secured Obligations or the solvency of any party bound for its payment, to the appointment of a receiver to take possession of the Mortgaged Property and to operate the Property and to collect and apply the Revenues. The receiver shall have all of the rights and powers permitted under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Mortgagor will pay to the Collateral Agent upon demand, all expenses, including receiver's fees, attorneys' fees, costs and agent's compensation, incurred pursuant to such appointment and all such expenses shall be a portion of the Secured Obligations. (c) Sale or Other Disposition of Mortgaged Property. Mortgagor waives any right to require the marshaling of any of its assets in connection with any disposition conducted pursuant hereto. In the event all or part of the Mortgaged Property is included at any foreclosure sale conducted pursuant hereto, a single total price for the Mortgaged Property, or such part thereof as is sold, may be accepted by the Collateral Agent with no obligation to distinguish between the application of such proceeds amongst the property comprising the Mortgaged Property. (d) Collection of Revenues. In connection with the exercise by Collateral Agent of the rights and remedies provided for in subparagraph (a)(ii) of this Paragraph 17: (i) Collateral Agent may notify any tenant, lessee or licensee of the Property, either in the name of Collateral Agent or Mortgagor, to make payment of Revenues directly to Collateral Agent or Collateral Agent's agents, may advise any person of Collateral Agent's interest in and to the Revenues, and may collect directly from such tenants, lessees and licensees all amounts due on account of the Revenues; (ii) At Collateral Agent's request, Mortgagor will provide written notification to any or all tenants, lessees and licensees of the Property concerning Collateral Agent's interest in the Revenues and will request that such tenants, lessees and licensees forward payment thereof directly to Collateral Agent; (iii) Mortgagor shall hold any proceeds and collections of any of the Revenues in trust for Collateral Agent and shall not commingle such proceeds or collections with any other funds of Mortgagor; and (iv) Mortgagor shall deliver all such proceeds to Collateral Agent immediately upon the receipt thereof by Mortgagor in the identical form received, but duly endorsed or assigned on behalf of Mortgagor to Collateral Agent. (e) CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT. FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROCURING POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY IN THE EVENT OF ANY DEFAULT HEREUNDER OR UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, 16 MORTGAGOR HEREBY AUTHORIZES AND EMPOWERS ANY ATTORNEY OF ANY COURT OF RECORD IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA OR ELSEWHERE, AS ATTORNEY FOR MORTGAGOR AND ALL PERSONS CLAIMING UNDER OR THROUGH MORTGAGOR, TO APPEAR FOR AND CONFESS JUDGMENT IN EJECTMENT FOR POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY AGAINST MORTGAGOR, AND AGAINST ALL PERSONS CLAIMING UNDER OR THROUGH MORTGAGOR, FOR THE RECOVERY BY COLLATERAL AGENT OF POSSESSION OF THE SAME, WITHOUT ANY STAY OF EXECUTION, FOR WHICH THIS MORTGAGE, OR A COPY THEREOF VERIFIED BY AFFIDAVIT, SHALL BE A SUFFICIENT WARRANT; AND THEREUPON A WRIT OF POSSESSION MAY BE ISSUED FORTHWITH, WITHOUT ANY PRIOR WRIT OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER. MORTGAGOR HEREBY RELEASES COLLATERAL AGENT FROM ALL ERRORS AND DEFECTS WHATSOEVER IN ENTERING SUCH ACTION AND JUDGMENT AND IN CAUSING SUCH WRIT OR WRITS TO BE ISSUED, AND HEREBY AGREES THAT NO WRIT OR ERROR, APPEAL, PETITION TO OPEN OR STRIKE OFF JUDGMENT, OR OTHER OBJECTION SHALL BE FILED OR MADE WITH RESPECT THERETO. IF FOR ANY REASON AFTER SUCH ACTION HAS BEEN COMMENCED THE SAME SHALL BE DISCONTINUED OR POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY SHALL REMAIN IN OR BE RESTORED TO MORTGAGOR, COLLATERAL AGENT SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT FOR THE SAME DEFAULT OR ANY SUBSEQUENT DEFAULT TO BRING ONE OR MORE FURTHER ACTIONS AS ABOVE PROVIDED TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY. COLLATERAL AGENT MAY BRING SUCH ACTION IN EJECTMENT BEFORE OR AFTER THE INSTITUTION OF FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS UPON THIS MORTGAGE, OR AFTER JUDGMENT THEREON OR ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, OR AFTER A SALE OF THE PROPERTY BY THE SHERIFF. (f) Additional Waivers by Mortgagor. Mortgagor hereby expressly waives and releases (a) all technical errors, defects and imperfections in any proceedings instituted by Collateral Agent under this Security Instrument; (b) all benefits that might accrue to Mortgagor by virtue of any present or future laws exempting the Property or any part of the proceeds arising from any sale thereof from attachment, levy or sale under execution, or providing for any stay of execution, exemption from civil process, or extension of time for payment; and (c) any present or future statue of limitation or moratorium law or any other present or future law, regulation or judicial decision which provides for any stay of execution, marshaling of assets, exemption from civil process, redemption, extension of time for payment or valuation or appraisement of any of the Property. (g) Use and Occupation of Property. In connection with the exercise of Agent's rights under Subparagraph (a)(v) of this Paragraph 17, the Collateral Agent may enter upon, occupy, and use all or any part of the Property and may 17 exclude Mortgagor from the Land and the Improvements or portion thereof as may have been so entered upon, occupied, or used. In the event Collateral Agent manages the Land and the Improvements in accordance with Subparagraph (a)(vi) herein, Mortgagor shall pay to the Collateral Agent on demand a reasonable fee for the management thereof in addition to the Secured Obligations. Further, the Collateral Agent may make such alterations, renovations, repairs, and replacements to the Improvements, as the Collateral Agent, in its sole discretion, deems proper or appropriate. The obligation of Mortgagor to pay such amounts and all expenses incurred by Collateral Agent in the exercise of its rights hereunder shall be included in the Secured Obligations and shall accrue interest at the Default Rate, unless collection from Mortgagor of interest at such rate would be contrary to applicable law, in which event such amounts shall bear interest at the highest rate which may be collected from Mortgagor under applicable law. (h) Partial Sales. Mortgagor agrees that in case Collateral Agent, in the exercise of the power of sale contained herein or in the exercise of any other rights hereunder given, elects to sell in parts or parcels, said sales may be held from time to time and that the power shall not be exhausted until all of the Mortgaged Property not previously sold shall have been sold, notwithstanding that the proceeds of such sales exceed, or may exceed, the Secured Obligations. (i) Post Judgment Remedies. Mortgagor authorizes the Collateral Agent, at its option after entry of any judgment in mortgage foreclosure pursuant to this Mortgage, and/or any judgment, by confession or otherwise, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, to petition, the court to which such judgment was entered to reassess damages and/or modify such judgment to include (i) all sums which may have been advanced or paid by Collateral Agent after the entry of such judgment for, or are otherwise due and payable for, taxes, water and sewer rents, other lienable charges or claims, attorneys' fees and costs, insurance for or repairs to or maintenance of the Property, and (ii) additional accrued interest at the highest rate of interest provided for under the Credit Agreement. (j) Assembly of Mortgaged Property. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may require Mortgagor to assemble that portion of the Mortgaged Property consisting of personal property and make it available to Collateral Agent, at Mortgagor's sole risk and expense, at a place or places to be designated by Collateral Agent which are reasonably convenient to both Collateral Agent and Mortgagor. (k) Power of Attorney. Mortgagor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Collateral Agent as Mortgagor's true and lawful attorney in fact, exercisable only after the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to take any action with respect to the Mortgaged Property to preserve, protect, or realize upon Collateral Agent's interest therein, each at the sole risk, cost and expense of Mortgagor, but for the sole benefit of the Collateral Agent. The rights and powers granted the Collateral Agent by the within appointment include, but are not limited to, the right and power to: (i) prosecute, defend, 18 compromise, settle, or release any action relating to the Mortgaged Property; (ii) endorse the name of Mortgagor in favor of Collateral Agent upon any and all checks or other items constituting Revenues; (iii) enter into leases or subleases relative to all or a portion of the Land or the Improvements; (iv) enter into any contracts or agreements relative to, and to take all action deemed necessary in connection with, the construction of any Improvements on the Land; (v) manage, operate, maintain, or repair the Land and the Improvements pursuant to Contracts or otherwise; and (vi) exercise the rights of Mortgagor under any Property Leases or any Contracts. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to perform any of such acts or to exercise any of such powers, but if the Collateral Agent elects so to perform or exercise, Collateral Agent shall not be accountable for more than it actually receives as a result of such exercise of power, and shall not be responsible to Mortgagor except for Collateral Agent's willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. All powers conferred upon the Collateral Agent by this Mortgage (which shall only be exercised only after the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default), being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable until terminated by a written instrument executed by a duly authorized officer of the Collateral Agent. 18. Notices. Any and all notices, demands, elections or requests provided for or permitted to be given pursuant to this Mortgage shall be given or served as provided in Section 9.1 of the Credit Agreement. 19. Successors and Assigns Bound; Captions. The covenants and agreements herein contained shall bind, and the rights hereunder shall inure to, the respective successors and assigns of Collateral Agent and Mortgagor, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6 hereof. The captions and headings of the paragraphs of this Mortgage are for convenience only and are not to be used to interpret or define the provisions hereof. 20. Governing Law; Severability. This Mortgage and the obligations of Mortgagor hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted and determined in accordance with the laws of the State of New York except that the creation, governance, administration and enforcement of Liens and rights and remedies with respect to the Property shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In the event that any provision or clause of this Mortgage or any other Loan Document conflicts with Applicable Law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of this Mortgage or such Loan Document which can be given effect without the conflicting provision, and to this end, the provisions of this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents are declared to be severable. In the event that any Applicable Law limiting the amount of interest or other charges permitted to be collected from Mortgagor is interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final order so that any charge for which provision is made in this Mortgage or in the other Loan Documents, whether considered separately or together with other charges permitted to be collected from Mortgagor, is interpreted so that any such charge, whether 19 considered separately or together with other charges that are considered a part of the transaction represented by this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, violates such law, and Mortgagor is entitled to the benefit of such law, such charge is hereby reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate such violation. The amounts, if any, previously paid to the Collateral Agent in excess of the amounts payable to the Collateral Agent pursuant to such charges as reduced shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to reduce the principal of the Secured Obligations. 21. Discharge. This Agreement shall terminate and the Collateral Agent shall discharge this Mortgage when all the Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, the Lenders have no further commitment to lend, there are no Letter of Credit Outstandings and the Issuing Banks have no further commitment to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement. Mortgagor shall pay Collateral Agent's reasonable costs incurred in discharging this Mortgage. 22. Waivers. (a) Mortgagor agrees to the full extent permitted by law, that in case of an Event of Default hereunder, neither Mortgagor nor anyone claiming through or under Mortgagor shall or will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, homestead, exemption or redemption laws now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement or foreclosure of this Mortgage, or the absolute sale of the Mortgaged Property, or the final and absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the purchasers thereat, and Mortgagor, for Mortgagor and all who may at any time claim through or under Mortgagor, hereby waives to the fullest extent that Mortgagor may lawfully so do, the benefit of all such laws, and any and all right to have the assets comprised in the security intended to be created hereby marshaled upon any foreclosure of the Lien hereof. (b) No failure or delay of the Collateral Agent in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the Collateral Agent would otherwise have. No waiver of any provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by Mortgagor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (c) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on the Mortgagor in any case shall entitle the Mortgagor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (c) Neither this Mortgage nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Collateral Agent and the Mortgagor with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.2 of the Credit Agreement. 20 (d) In the event of the sale or transfer by operation of law or otherwise of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property, the Collateral Agent, without notice, is hereby authorized and empowered to deal with any such vendee or transferee with reference to the Mortgaged Property or the Secured Obligations or with reference to any of the terms, covenants, conditions or agreements hereof, as fully and to the same extent as it might deal with the original parties hereto and without in any way releasing or discharging any liabilities, obligations or undertakings (including, without limitation, the restrictions upon transfer contained in Paragraph 5). 23. Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time, upon request by the Collateral Agent, Mortgagor will make, execute and deliver, or cause to be made, executed and delivered, to the Collateral Agent and, where appropriate, cause to be recorded and/or filed and from time to time thereafter to be re-recorded and/or refiled at such time and in such offices and places as shall be deemed desirable by the Collateral Agent, any and all such other and further assignments, mortgages, security agreements, financing statements, continuation statements, instruments of further assurance, certificates and other documents as may, in the opinion of the Collateral Agent, be necessary or desirable in order to effectuate, complete, or perfect, or to continue and preserve (a) the obligations of Mortgagor under this Mortgage, and (b) the Lien created by this Mortgage upon the Mortgaged Property. Upon any failure by Mortgagor so to do, the Collateral Agent may make, execute, record, file, re-record and/or refile any and all such assignments, mortgages, security agreements, financing statements, continuation statements, instruments, certificates, and documents for and in the name of Mortgagor, and Mortgagor hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent the agent and attorney in fact of Mortgagor so to do. 24. Subrogation. The Collateral Agent shall be subrogated to all right, title, Lien or equity of all persons to whom Collateral Agent may have paid any monies in settlement of Liens or in acquisition of title or for its benefit hereunder, or for the benefit or account of Mortgagor or subsequently paid under any provisions hereof. 25. Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to each and every covenant, agreement and obligation of Mortgagor under this Mortgage and any and all other Loan Documents. 26. Collateral Agent's Fees and Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Without in anyway limiting any other reimbursement obligations contained under the other Loan Documents, the Mortgagor agrees to pay upon demand to the Collateral Agent the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of its counsel and of any experts or agents, which the Collateral Agent may incur in connection with the exercise, enforcement or protection of any of the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder. 21 (b) Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other Loan Documents, the Mortgagor agrees to indemnify the Collateral Agent and the other Indemnitees against, and hold each of them harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel, incurred by or asserted against any of them arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of, the execution, delivery or performance of this Mortgage or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating hereto or to the Mortgaged Property, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. (c) Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Secured Obligations secured hereby and by the other Security Documents. The provisions of this Paragraph 26 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Mortgage or any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Secured Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Mortgage or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party. All amounts due under this Paragraph 26 shall be payable on written demand therefor. 27. Submission to Jurisdiction. MORTGAGOR AGREES THAT ANY SUIT FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS MORTGAGE MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN OR ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING THEREIN AS THE COLLATERAL AGENT MAY ELECT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AND CONSENTS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. MORTGAGOR AND COLLATERAL AGENT (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THIS MORTGAGE) EACH HEREBY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT OR ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH SUIT IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM AND AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. NOTHING IN THIS MORTGAGE OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT COLLATERAL AGENT MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS MORTGAGE AGAINST COLLATERAL AGENT OR ITS PROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION. MORTGAGOR AGREES THAT ANY ACTION COMMENCED BY MORTGAGOR ASSERTING ANY CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING 22 UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MORTGAGE OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT SOLELY IN A COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN OR ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING THEREIN AS THE COLLATERAL AGENT MAY ELECT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AND CONSENTS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH ACTION. MORTGAGOR AND COLLATERAL AGENT (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THIS MORTGAGE) IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 9.1 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF MORTGAGOR AND COLLATERAL AGENT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW. 28. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. MORTGAGOR AND COLLATERAL AGENT (BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THIS MORTGAGE) EACH HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO A JURY IN ANY TRIAL OF ANY CASE OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY) IN WHICH ANY SUCH PERSON IS OR BECOMES A PARTY (WHETHER SUCH CASE OR CONTROVERSY IS INITIATED BY OR AGAINST ANY SUCH PERSON OR IN WHICH ANY SUCH PERSON IS JOINED AS A PARTY LITIGANT), WHICH CASE OR CONTROVERSY ARISES OUT OF OR IS IN RESPECT OF, ANY RELATIONSHIP AMONGST OR BETWEEN ANY LOAN PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON AND ANY SECURED PARTY OR PARTICIPANT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY SECURED PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH OF MORTGAGOR AND COLLATERAL AGENT (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS MORTGAGE BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH 28. 29. Future Advances. This Mortgage secures future advances made pursuant to this Mortgage or the Credit Agreement. 30. Advance Money Mortgage. This Mortgage secures future advances made pursuant to the Credit Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, this Mortgage secures all advances made by the Collateral Agent of any kind or nature described in 42 Pa. C.S. Section 8144. The maximum principal amount that may be secured by this Mortgage is $400,000,000 plus certain other unpaid balances of advances, 23 interest and costs and expenses described above; provided that in no event shall Collateral Agent be obligated to advance to or for the benefit of Mortgagor in excess of the stated principal amount of the loans evidencing the Secured Obligations.

All noncash dividends, and all dividends paid or payable in cash or otherwise in connection with a partial or total liquidation or dissolution, return of capital, capital surplus or paid-in surplus, and all other distributions (other than dividends and distributions referred to in the preceding sentence) made on or in respect of the Pledged Collateral, whether paid or payable in cash or otherwise, whether resulting from a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the outstanding capital stock or partnership interests of the issuer of any Pledged Securities or received in exchange for Pledged Securities or any part thereof, or in redemption thereof, or as a result of any merger, amalgamation, arrangement, consolidation, acquisition or other exchange of assets to which such issuer may be a party or otherwise, shall be and become part of the Pledged Collateral, and, if received by the Pledgor, to the extent required to be paid to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, shall not be commingled by the Pledgor with any of its other funds or property but shall be held separate and apart therefrom, shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and shall be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). 6.3 Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Cash Dominion Event, all rights of the Pledgor to dividends that the Pledgor is authorized to receive pursuant to Section 6.2 above shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to receive and retain such dividends.

Any and all money and other property paid over to or received by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.3 shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 8. 6.4 Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of the Pledgor to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to 6.1 shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to exercise such voting and consensual rights and powers; provided that the Collateral Agent shall have the right from time to time following and during the continuance of an Event of Default to permit the Pledgor to exercise such rights. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived in writing by the Collateral Agent, the Pledgor will have the right to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers that they would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to the terms of 6.1. SECTION 7 Remedies upon Default Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, it is agreed that the Collateral Agent shall have in any jurisdiction in which enforcement hereof is sought, in addition to all other rights and -7- remedies, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or other Applicable Law. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent shall include, without limitation, the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times: 7.1 The Collateral Agent may sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Collateral, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of the Pledgor. 7.2 The Collateral Agent shall give the Pledgor at least ten (10) days' prior written notice, by authenticated record, of the Collateral Agent's intention to make any sale of the Pledged Collateral. Such notice, (i) in the case of a public sale, shall state the date, time and place for such sale, (ii) in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Pledged Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange, and (iii) in the case of a private sale, shall state the date after which any private sale or other disposition of the Pledged Collateral shall be made. The Pledgor agrees that such written notice shall satisfy all requirements for notice to the Pledgor which are imposed under the UCC with respect to the exercise of the Collateral Agent's rights and remedies upon default. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of any Pledged Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale or other disposition of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. 7.3 Any public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale. 7.4 At any public (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 7, the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of the Pledgor, the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Party from the Pledgor on account of the Obligations as a credit against the purchase price, and the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to the Pledgor therefor. 7.5 For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Pledged Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof. The Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and the Pledgor shall not be entitled to the return of the Pledged Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the -8- Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full. 7.6 As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the Pledged Collateral and to sell the Pledged Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. 7.7 The Pledgor recognizes that (i) the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of all or a part of the Pledged Collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. Section 77, (as amended and in effect, the "Securities Act") or the Securities laws of various states (the "Blue Sky Laws"), but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire the Pledged Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, (ii) that private sales so made may be at prices and upon other terms less favorable to the seller than if the Pledged Collateral were sold at public sales, (iii) that neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party has any obligation to delay sale of any of the Pledged Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the Pledged Collateral to be registered for public sale under the Securities Act or the Blue Sky Laws, and (iv) that private sales made under the foregoing circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. 7.8 To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Pledgor hereby waives all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal which the Pledgor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. SECTION 8 Application of Proceeds of Sale The proceeds of any sale of Pledged Collateral pursuant to Section 7, as well as any Pledged Collateral consisting of cash, shall be applied by the Collateral Agent as required pursuant to the terms of Section 6.2 of the Security Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Collateral by the Collateral Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the Collateral Agent or of the officer making the sale or other disposition shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Pledged Collateral so sold or otherwise disposed of and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of -9- the purchase money paid over to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. SECTION 9 Registration, Etc. If the Collateral Agent reasonably determines that it is necessary to sell any of the Pledged Securities at a public sale, the Pledgor agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default hereunder, the Pledgor will, at any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Collateral Agent, use its best efforts to take or to cause the Issuer of such Pledged Securities to take such action and prepare, distribute and/or file such documents, as are required or advisable in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Collateral Agent to permit the public sale of such Pledged Securities. Without limiting any of its other indemnification obligations under the Loan Documents, the Pledgor agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Collateral Agent, each other Secured Party, any underwriter and their respective officers, directors, Affiliates and controlling Persons from and against all loss, liability, expenses, costs of counsel (including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel to the Collateral Agent), and claims (including the reasonable costs of investigation) that any of them may incur insofar as such loss, liability, expense or claim arises out of, or is based upon, any alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or in any notification or offering circular, or arises out of or is based upon any alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements in any thereof not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by any untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to the Pledgor or the Issuer of such Pledged Securities by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party expressly for use therein. The Pledgor further agrees, upon such written request referred to above, to use its best efforts to qualify, file or register, or cause the Issuer of such Pledged Securities to qualify, file or register, any of the Pledged Securities under the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws or other securities laws of such states as may be requested by the Collateral Agent and keep effective, or cause to be kept effective, all such qualifications, filings or registrations. The Pledgor will bear all costs and expenses of carrying out their obligations under this Section 9. The Pledgor acknowledges that there is no adequate remedy at law for failure by them to comply with the provisions of this Section 9 and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, and therefore agree that their agreements contained in this Section 9 may be specifically enforced. SECTION 10 Further Assurances The Pledgor agrees to do such further acts and things, and to execute and deliver such additional conveyances, assignments, agreements and instruments, as the Collateral Agent may at any time reasonably request in connection with the administration and enforcement of this -10- Agreement or with respect to the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof or in order better to assure and confirm unto the Collateral Agent its rights and remedies hereunder. SECTION 11 Intent This Agreement is being executed and delivered by the Pledgor for the purpose of confirming the grant of the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Pledged Collateral. It is intended that the security interest granted pursuant to this Agreement is granted as a supplement to, and not in limitation of, the Security Interest granted to the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, under the Security Agreement. All provisions of the Security Agreement shall apply to the Pledged Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall have the same rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions with respect to the security interests created in the Pledged Collateral as in all other Collateral. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Security Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control with respect to the Pledged Collateral and the Security Agreement with respect to all other Collateral. SECTION 12 Governing Law THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

Exhibit 10.8 REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT This REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made as of October 8th, 2005, by and among GSC Holdings Corp. (to be renamed GameStop Corp.), a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and EB Nevada Inc., a Nevada corporation and James J. Kim (the "Stockholders"), and each person or entity that subsequently becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of Section 11 hereof. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement (as defined below). WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated April 17, 2005, each share of common stock of Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive Company Cash Consideration and Company Stock Consideration; WHEREAS, the Company and the Stockholders are executing and delivering this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Kim Group Voting Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 1. DEFINITIONS. As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: "Board" shall mean the board of directors of the Company. "Exchange Act" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all of the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. "Holder" shall mean, collectively, the Stockholders and the Permitted Transferees; provided, however, that the term "Holder" shall not include any of the foregoing that ceases to own or hold any Registrable Securities. "Permitted Transferee" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 11. "Registrable Securities" shall mean (i) the Company Stock Consideration issued to the Stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) shall include any shares of the Company's Common Stock issued with respect to the Registrable Securities as a result of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, exchange or similar event; provided, however, that all Registrable Securities shall cease to be Registrable Securities once they have been sold pursuant to a registration statement or such shares are transferred pursuant to Rule 144 or are eligible to be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144(k). "Rule 144" shall mean Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and any successor or substitute rule, law or provision. "SEC" shall mean the Securities and Exchange Commission. "Securities Act" shall mean the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and all of the rules and regulations promulgated there under. 2. EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement shall become effective and legally binding upon the Effective Time. 3. MANDATORY REGISTRATION. (a) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, subject to Section 6, the Company will prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 or any successor form (except that if the Company is not then eligible to register for resale the Registrable Securities on Form S-3, then such registration shall be on Form S-1 or any successor form) for the purpose of registering under the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities for resale by, and for the account of, the Holders as selling stockholders thereunder (the "Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement shall permit the Holders to offer and sell, on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, any or all of the Registrable Securities. The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective (which shall include using reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC in respect of the Registration Statement within ten (10) business days following receipt thereof) within 90 days following the Effective Time. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective until the earlier of (i) the date when all of the Registrable Securities registered thereunder shall have been sold, or (ii) the date all Registrable Securities are eligible to be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144(k). (b) Within three (3) business days after a Registration Statement that covers applicable Registrable Securities is declared effective by the SEC, the Company shall deliver, or shall cause legal counsel to deliver, to the transfer agent for such Registrable Securities (with copies to the Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in such Registration Statement) confirmation that such Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC. 4. COMPANY REGISTRATION. (a) If, at any time (but without any obligation to do so), the Company proposes to register any of its Common Stock or other equity securities under the Securities Act on Form S-1, Form S-2 or Form S-3 (or an equivalent general registration form then in effect) for purposes of an offering or sale by or on behalf of the Company of its Common Stock or other equity securities for its own account, then each such time the Company shall, at least 20 business days prior to the time when any such registration statement is filed with the SEC, give prompt written notice to the Holders of its intention to do so. Such notice shall specify, at a minimum, the number and class of shares or other equity securities so proposed to be registered, the proposed date of filing of such registration statement, any proposed means of distribution of such shares or other equity securities, any proposed managing underwriter or underwriters of such shares or other equity securities and a good faith estimate by the Company of the proposed maximum offering price thereof, as such price is proposed to appear on the facing page of such registration statement. Upon the written direction of any Holder or Holders, given within 10 days following the receipt by such Holder of such written notice (which direction shall specify the number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Holder and the intended method of distribution thereof), the Company shall include in such registration statement any or all of the Registrable Securities then held by such Holder requesting such registration (a "Selling Holder") to the extent necessary to permit the sale or other disposition of such number of Registrable Securities as such Selling Holder has so directed the Company to be so registered. Failure of any Stockholders to respond to the Company's notice within the 10-day period specified above shall be deemed an election by such Holder not to have any of such Holder's Registrable Securities included in such registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holders shall not have any right under this Section 4(a) if the registration proposed to be effected by the Company relates solely to shares of Common Stock or other equity securities that are issuable (1) solely to officers or employees of the Company or any subsidiary thereof pursuant to a bona fide employee stock option, bonus or other employee benefit plan or (2) as direct consideration in connection with a merger, exchange offer or acquisition of a business. (b) In the event that the Company proposes to register shares of Common Stock or other equity securities for purposes of an offering described in the first sentence of Section 4(a), and any managing underwriter shall advise the Company and the Selling Holders in writing that, in its opinion, market or other factors require a limitation of the number of securities to be underwritten, then the Company will include in such registration statement such number of shares or securities as the Company and such Selling Holders are so advised can be sold in such offering (the "Offering Maximum Number"), as follows and in the following order of priority: (A) first, the number of shares or securities proposed to be included by the Company, and (B) second, if and to the extent that the number of shares or securities to be registered under clause (A) is less than the Offering Maximum Number, Registrable Securities of each Selling Holder, allocated pro rata and without any priority as between the Selling Holders, in proportion to the number sought to be registered by each Selling Holder relative to the number sought to be registered by all the Selling Holders, that, in the aggregate, when added to the number of shares or securities to be registered under clause (A), equals the Offering Maximum Number. (c) The Company shall have no obligation under this Section 4 to make any offering of its securities, or to complete an offering of its securities that it proposes to make, and shall incur no liability to the Holders for its failure to do so. 2 (d) Any Holder having notified or directed the Company to include any or all of such Holder's Registrable Securities in a registration statement pursuant to this Section 4 hereof shall have the right to withdraw such notice or direction with respect to any or all of the Registrable Securities designated for registration thereby by giving written notice to such effect to the Company at least five business days prior to the anticipated effective date of such registration statement. In the event of any such withdrawal, the Company shall amend, at the withdrawing Holder's expense, such registration statement and take such other actions as may be necessary so that such withdrawn Registrable Securities are not included in the applicable registration and not sold pursuant thereto, and such withdrawn Registrable Securities shall continue to be Registrable Securities in accordance herewith. No such withdrawal shall affect the obligations of the Company with respect to Registrable Securities not so withdrawn. (e) Any Holder having notified or directed the Company to include any or all of such Holder's Registrable Securities in a registration statement pursuant to this Section 4, shall, unless otherwise agreed by the Company, offer and sell such Registrable Securities using the same underwriter or underwriters and on the same terms and conditions as other securities included in such underwritten offering. Each Selling Holder participating in the underwritten offering shall (i) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the managing underwriter or underwriters containing conventional representations, warranties, allocation of expenses, and customary closing conditions with any underwriter who acquires any Registrable Securities; and (ii) complete and execute all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of such underwritten offering. 5. OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. In connection with the Company's obligations with respect to registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 hereof, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect or cause such registration to permit the sale of the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof described in the registration statement relating thereto and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for the period from the date of effectiveness (the "Effective Date") of such registration statement until the earlier of (1) the date on which the disposition of all of the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement is completed or (ii) the date all Registrable Securities are eligible to be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144(k), (such period, the "Registration Period"). In connection therewith, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable: (a) Pursuant to Section 3 hereof, prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3, or such other form as may be utilized by the Company and as shall permit the disposition of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods thereof, as specified in writing by the Holders thereof; (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective during the Registration Period and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities by the Holders, and furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities 3 registered thereby and the underwriters, if any, thereof and the sales or placement agent, if any, therefor copies of any such supplement or amendment prior to its being used and/or filed with the SEC; (c) comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act applicable to the Company with respect to the disposition of all of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition by the Holders thereof; (d) provide the Holders and counsel for the Holders thereof the opportunity to participate in the preparation of such registration statement, each prospectus included therein or filed with the SEC and each supplement or amendment thereto; (e) furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities to be registered in such registration statement (A) such number of copies (including manually executed and conformed copies) of such registration statement and of each amendment thereof and supplement thereto (including all annexes, appendices, schedules and exhibits), (B) such number of copies of the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus, any summary prospectus and the final prospectus and including prospectus supplements), and (C) such number of copies of other documents, if any, incorporated by reference in such registration statement or prospectus, in each case as each respective party may reasonably request in order to facilitate the offering and disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by any such Holder, offered or sold by such agent, or underwritten by such underwriter, and to permit each Holder, agent and underwriter to satisfy the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act; and the Company hereby consents to the use of such prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus, any summary prospectus and the final prospectus) and any amendment or supplement thereto by each Holder and by any such agent and underwriter, in each case in the form most recently provided to such party by the Company, in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by the prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus, any summary prospectus and the final prospectus) or any supplement or amendment thereto; (f) promptly notify the Holders of Registrable Securities registered thereby, the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, thereof and the sales or placement agent, if any, therefor and, if requested by any such party, confirm such notification in writing, (A) when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement has been filed with the SEC and when the registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has been filed with and declared effective by the SEC, (B) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order or the coming to its knowledge of the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (C) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (D) of the occurrence of any event that requires the making of any changes to the registration statement or related prospectus so that such documents will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (and the Company shall promptly prepare and furnish to the Holders upon 4 request, a reasonable number of copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus such that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading), and (E) of the Company's determination that the filing of a post-effective amendment to the registration statement shall be necessary or appropriate; and, upon the receipt of any notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in this Section 5(f)(B), (C) (but only with respect to the jurisdiction suspending qualification), (D) or (E), (1) the Holders, underwriters and agents shall forthwith discontinue any offer and disposition of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such Registrable Securities and, if so directed by the Company, shall deliver to the Company all copies (other than permanent file copies) of the defective prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that are then in the Holders', underwriters' and agents' possession or control, and (2) the Company shall, as promptly as practicable thereafter (subject, in the case of Section 5 (f)(D), to the provisions of Section 10), take such action as shall be necessary to remedy such event to permit the Holders (and the underwriters and agents, if any) to continue to offer and dispose of the Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, preparing and filing with the SEC and furnishing to the Holders a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter deliverable to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (g) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement under and to the extent required by such other securities or state blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder, underwriter or sales or placement agent shall request, and do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary under such securities or blue sky laws to enable the Holders, underwriters and agents to consummate the public sale or other disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by the Holders, except that the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so qualified or submit to liability for state or local taxes where it would not otherwise be liable for such taxes; (h) if requested by any managing underwriter or underwriters, any placement or sales agent or any Holder, promptly incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as is required by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and as such managing underwriter or underwriters, such agent or such Holder specifies should be included therein relating to the terms of the sale of such Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, information with respect to the number of Registrable Securities being sold by the Holders or agent or to any underwriters, the name and description of the Holders, agent or underwriter, the offering price of such Registrable Securities and any discount, commission or other compensation payable in respect thereof, the purchase price being paid therefor by such underwriters and with respect to any other terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold by the Holders or agent or to such underwriters; and make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment promptly after notification of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment; 5 (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent or approval of each governmental agency or authority, whether federal, state or local, that may be required to effect such registration or the offering or sale in connection therewith or to enable the Holders to offer, or to consummate the disposition of, the Registrable Securities; and (j) furnish to the Holders or the managing underwriters, if any, on a timely basis and at the Company's expense, certificates free of any restrictive legends representing ownership of the Registrable Securities being sold in such denominations and registered in such names as the Holders or managing underwriters shall request, and notify the transfer agent of the Company's securities that it may effect transfers of the Registrable Securities upon notification from each respective Holder that it has complied with this Agreement and the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. 6. FURNISH INFORMATION. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to this Agreement that the selling Holders shall furnish to the Company such information regarding them and the securities held by them as the Company shall reasonably request and as shall be required in order to effect any registration by the Company pursuant to this Agreement. 7. EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION. All expenses incurred in connection with the registration of the Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement (excluding underwriting, brokerage and other selling commissions and discounts), including without limitation all registration and qualification and filing fees, printing, and fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company, shall be borne by the Company. In all cases, the selling Holders will be responsible for, if applicable, underwriters discounts, brokerage or other selling commissions and fees and disbursements of counsel for such Holders. 8. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. (a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each selling Holder, any investment banking firm acting as an underwriter for the selling Holder, any broker/dealer acting on behalf of any selling Holder and each officer and director of such selling Holder, such underwriter, such broker/dealer and each person, if any, who controls such selling Holder, underwriter or broker/dealer within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, in any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus relating thereto or in any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or any such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are made; and will reimburse such selling Holder, such underwriter, broker/dealer or such officer, director or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this 6 Section 8(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in connection with the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus relating thereto or any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or any such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with the Registration Statement or any such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus by or on behalf of the selling Holder, any underwriter for them or controlling person with respect to them. This Section 8(a) shall not inure to the benefit of any selling Holder with respect to any person asserting loss, damage, liability or action as a result of a selling Holder selling Registrable Securities during a Suspension Period (as defined in Section 10 hereof) or selling in violation of Section 5(c) of the Securities Act. (b) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its officers and directors, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, any investment banking firm acting as underwriter for the Company or the selling Holder, or any broker/dealer acting on behalf of the Company or any other selling Holder, and all other selling Holders against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter, or broker/dealer or other selling Holder may become subject to, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, relating thereto or in any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or any such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are made, in each case to the extent and only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, in any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus relating thereto or in any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or any such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such selling Holder expressly for use in connection with the Registration Statement or any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus related thereto; and such selling Holders will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter, broker/dealer or other selling Holder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the liability of each selling Holder hereunder shall be limited to the gross proceeds (net of underwriting discounts and commissions, if any) received by such selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement; and provided, further, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of those selling Holder(s) against which the request for indemnity is being made (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). 7 (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and, to the extent the indemnifying party desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume at its expense the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying parties with the consent of the indemnified party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that the indemnifying party assumes any such defense, the indemnified party may participate in such defense with its own counsel and at its own expense, provided, however, that the counsel for the indemnifying party shall act as lead counsel in all matters pertaining to such defense or settlement of such claim and the indemnifying party shall only pay for such indemnified party's expenses for the period prior to the date of its participation on such defense. The failure to notify an indemnifying party promptly of the commencement of any such action, if materially prejudicial to his ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 8 to the extent of such prejudice, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve him of any liability which he may have to any indemnified party otherwise other than under this Section 8. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to settle any claim, suit or proceeding unless in connection with such settlement the indemnified party receives an unconditional release with respect to the subject matter of such claim, suit or proceeding and such settlement does not contain any admission of fault by the indemnified party. (e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution under the Securities Act in any case in which (i) the indemnified party makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8 hereof but is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that the express provisions of Section 8 hereof provide for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any indemnified party, then the Company and the applicable selling Holder shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (which shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, include, but not be limited to, all reasonable costs of defense and investigation and all reasonable attorneys' fees), in either such case (after contribution from others) on the basis of relative fault as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the applicable selling Holder on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8(e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) 8 referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8(e), in no event shall (i) any selling Holder be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 8(e) for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the gross proceeds to be received by the selling Holder from the sale of such selling Holder's Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) pursuant to any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities are or were to be registered under the Securities Act and (ii) any underwriter be required to undertake liability to any person hereunder for any amounts in excess of the aggregate discount, commission or other compensation payable to such underwriter with respect to the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed pursuant to the Registration Statement. 9. REPORTS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. With respect to each Holder, from the date of Closing until the date on which all of the Registrable Securities that such Holder owns become freely transferable under Rule 144(k) promulgated under the Securities Act, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts: (i) to make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in the General Instructions to Form S-3, or any successor or substitute form, and in Rule 144, (ii) to file with the SEC all reports and other documents required to be filed by an issuer of securities registered under Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and (iii) if such filings are not available via EDGAR, to furnish to such Holder as long as the Holder owns or has the right to acquire any Registrable Securities prior to the applicable termination date described above, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company under Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as may be reasonably requested in availing such Holder of any rule or regulation of the SEC permitting the selling of any such Registrable Securities without registration. 10. DEFERRAL AND LOCK-UP. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Company shall furnish to the selling Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company stating that the Board has made the good faith determination (i) that continued use by the selling Holders of the Registration Statement for purposes of effecting offers or sales of Registrable Securities pursuant thereto would require, under the Securities Act, disclosure in the Registration Statement (or the prospectus relating thereto) of material, nonpublic information concerning the Company, its business or prospects or any proposed transaction involving the Company, and (ii) that such disclosure would be premature and would be adverse to the Company, its business or prospects or any such proposed transaction or would make the successful consummation by the Company of any such transaction significantly less likely, then the right of the selling Holders to use the Registration Statement (and the prospectus relating 9 thereto) for purposes of effecting offers or sales of Registrable Securities pursuant thereto shall be suspended for a period (the "Suspension Period") of not more than 60 days after delivery by the Company of the certificate referred to above in this Section 10. During the Suspension Period, none of the Holders shall offer or sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to or in reliance upon the Registration Statement (or the prospectus relating thereto). The Company may not exercise this right more than two times in each year after the Closing.
