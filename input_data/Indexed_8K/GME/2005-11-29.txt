Exhibit 99.1 GameStop Corp. Sales Increase 28%; Third Quarter EPS Meets Consensus Estimates; Merger Integration On Track GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 29, 2005--GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME)(NYSE:GME.B), a leading global video game and entertainment software retailer, today reported sales and earnings for the third quarter ended October 29, 2005. GameStop sales were $534.2 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared with $416.7 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 28.2%. As expected, comparable store sales decreased by 12% due to major software titles released in the third quarter of 2004, particularly Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas from Take-Two Interactive and Fable from Microsoft. Net loss for the third quarter was $2.5 million, including merger costs of $18.8 million, $11.9 million net of taxes, compared with net earnings of $12.0 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted loss per share was $0.04, including merger costs of $0.19 per diluted share and hurricane losses and disaster relief of $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to earnings of $0.21 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. These results were at the high-end of previously announced guidance. "We made significant progress during the third quarter to position ourselves for the fourth quarter and the long term," stated R. Richard Fontaine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We successfully completed our merger with Electronics Boutique, integration milestones are being met, and a number of best practices have already been cross-applied to the combined company." Fontaine also indicated that, "Third quarter gross margins were positively effected by strong used video games sales as value-driven customers became a larger factor in the face of rising gas prices and general economic uncertainty. During November we experienced weaker than expected new video game software sales mainly due to core customers waiting for the launch of Microsoft's Xbox 360 and to value consumers continuing to gravitate to used video games. We anticipate this trend to continue to a degree throughout the holiday season, with gross sales levels declining, but strong margin contributions supporting forecasted earnings." "On the Xbox 360 front, GameStop sold through every copy we had and did so in record time. There is no question that both the core gamer and gift giver are very enthusiastic about this great product. In fact, our attach ratio of games and accessories to date has never been higher for any release in GameStop's history. Our only concern is that the total hardware released to date in the U.S., and to GameStop, are far less than we had anticipated. While we expect to be supplied throughout the holiday season, the exact quantities to be shipped are not yet clear." Updated Guidance GameStop expects comparable store sales in the fourth quarter to range between flat and +2.0%, following supply limitations of Microsoft's Xbox 360 and slower than anticipated new video game software sales in the first three weeks of November. Used video game sales growth continues to solidly meet our goals, supporting our forecast that diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter will range from $0.98 to $1.02. GameStop also expects full year 2005 diluted earnings per share will range from $1.65 to $1.70. Please note that guidance does not include merger costs related to the business combination.
