Exhibit 99.3 GAMESTOP CORP. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of July 30, 2005 gives effect to the business combination (the "merger" or "business combination") of Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. ("EB") and GameStop Holdings Corp., formerly known as GameStop Corp., ("Historical GameStop") into wholly-owned subsidiaries of GameStop Corp., formerly known as GSC Holdings Corp. (the "Company") as if it occurred on that date. The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 and for the 26 weeks ended July 30, 2005 gives effect to the merger as if it occurred on February 1, 2004. The fiscal year of the Company, Historical GameStop and EB is composed of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Reclassifications have been made to the historical financial statements of Historical GameStop and EB to conform to the presentation used by the Company. In the merger, which was completed on October 8, 2005, EB common stockholders received $38.15 in cash and 0.78795 of a share of the Company's Class A common stock for each share of EB common stock that they owned. In addition, Historical GameStop stockholders received one share of the Company's Class A common stock for each share of Historical GameStop Class A common stock that they owned and one share of the Company's Class B common stock for each share of Historical GameStop Class B common stock that they owned. The merger and related transactions were treated as a purchase business combination for accounting purposes, and EB's assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair value. The Historical GameStop Class A common stock price was $21.61 per share (based on the closing price for Historical GameStop Class A common stock on April 15, 2005, the last trading day prior to the April 18, 2005 public announcement of the merger) and 25.7 million shares of EB common stock were outstanding at the date of completion of the merger. Approximately 22.2 million and 29.9 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock and the Company's Class B common stock, respectively, were issued in exchange for all outstanding common stock of Historical GameStop, based on the one-for-one exchange ratio. An aggregate of 20.2 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock were issued and $979.4 million in cash was paid in consideration for all outstanding common stock of EB. In addition, $13.8 million in cash was paid to the holders in exchange for all of the outstanding stock options of EB. Principally all of the cash consideration paid was from the proceeds of the Company's issuance of $300 million of senior floating rate notes due 2011 and $650 million aggregate principal senior notes due 2012. The allocations of the purchase price to EB's assets, including intangible assets, and liabilities have been based on estimates of fair values. These allocations are preliminary and further refinements are likely to be made. Among the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations," criteria have been established for determining whether intangible assets should be recognized separately from goodwill. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" provides, among other guidelines, that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized, but rather are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Management expects that the benefits of the business combination will generate approximately $30.0 million of cost savings and operating synergies by the end of the fiscal year ending February 3, 2007 and $50.0 million annually thereafter by capitalizing on consolidation and integration of certain functions as well as through the adoption of best practices from both Historical GameStop and EB. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed statements of operations do not include any cost saving synergies which may be achievable. The unaudited pro forma financial information shown under this heading is presented for informational purposes only, is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would actually have occurred had the merger or the related transactions been consummated as of the date or at the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position. The unaudited pro forma financial information under this heading and the accompanying notes should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. 1

GAMESTOP CORP. NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (in thousands, except per share data) 1. Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical presentation of Historical GameStop and EB to conform to the presentation used in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet. 2. In connection with the business combination, EB stockholders received $38.15 in cash plus .78795 shares of the Company Class A common stock for each share of EB common stock that they own. Until the close, EB option holders had the right to exercise their options, giving them the right to receive the same consideration as the EB stockholders as described above. To the extent the options were exercised, EB received cash proceeds equal to the exercise price of the option and a tax benefit equal to the stock value at the date of exercise, net of the exercise price, multiplied be the effective tax rate. For those options that remained unexercised as of the close, those option holders had the right to receive $38.15 in cash plus cash equal to .78795 multiplied by the average of the closing prices of Historical GameStop Class A common stock for the ten trading days prior to the closing date less their exercise price less applicable tax withholding. Cash consideration of $13,839 was used to retire the outstanding options. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total consideration as shown in the table below is allocated to EB's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their fair values as of July 30, 2005. The consideration was as follows: Based upon the assessment of the fair values, the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the proportionate amount of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the combination with EB is as follows: Current assets.................................................. $ 450,328 Property and equipment, net..................................... 226,857 Goodwill........................................................ 1,145,445 Intangible assets: Executive employment contracts and non-compete agreement..... 282 Point of sale software....................................... 3,150 Leasehold interests.......................................... 17,299 ------------- Total intangible assets................................... 20,731 Other noncurrent assets......................................... 26,947 Current liabilities............................................. (339,208) Deferred income tax liabilities................................ (50,114) Long-term liabilities.......................................... (37,030) ------------- Total purchase price............................................ $ 1,443,956 ============= 4 The total weighted average amortization period for the intangible assets is approximately four years. The intangible assets are being amortized based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized. The goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and will not be amortized. In connection with the merger, management incurred merger related costs and commenced integration activities which have resulted in, or will result in, involuntary employment terminations, lease terminations, disposals of property and equipment and other costs and expenses. The liability for involuntary termination benefits covers severance amounts, payroll taxes and benefit costs for approximately 680 employees, primarily in general and administrative functions in EB's Pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center and Nevada call center, which are expected to be closed in the first half of fiscal 2006. These employees are expected to be terminated between December 2005 and July 2006. Certain senior executives with EB received payments in the amount of $3,960 in accordance with employment contracts. The Pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center are owned facilities which are currently being marketed for sale and are classified in the accompanying balance sheet as "Assets to be disposed of". Sale of these facilities is expected to occur within the next year. The liability for lease terminations is associated with stores and the Nevada call center to be closed and will be paid over the remaining lease terms through 2015, if the Company is unsuccessful in negotiating lease terminations or sublease agreements. The Company intends to close these stores in the next year. The disposals of property and equipment are related to assets of Historical GameStop which are either impaired or have been, or will be, either abandoned or disposed of due to the merger. Certain costs associated with the disposition of these assets remain as an accrual until the assets are disposed of and the costs are paid, which is expected to occur in the next few months. Merger related costs include professional fees, financing costs and other costs associated with the merger and include certain ongoing costs associated with integrating the operations of Historical GameStop and EB, including relocation costs. The Company is working to finalize integration plans which may result in additional involuntary employment terminations, lease and other contractual terminations and employee relocations. The Company will finalize integration plans and related liabilities in 2006 and management anticipates completion of all integration activities in 2006. Finalization of integration plans may result in additional liabilities which will increase goodwill.
