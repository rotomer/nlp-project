Other Events.
 
Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Listed Company Manual requires NYSE-listed companies to disclose in their annual proxy statements the non-management director who is chosen to preside at all regularly-scheduled executive sessions of the non-management members of the board of directors, or, alternatively, the procedure by which a presiding director is chosen for each session.
 
GameStop Corp. (the "Company"), in its proxy statement filed September 2, 2005, inadvertently omitted the name of the non-management director who presides at the non-management executive sessions. The presiding director for each non-management executive session is Stephanie M. Shern, Chair of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.
