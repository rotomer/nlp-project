Exhibit 99.1 GameStop Reports Record Sales and Earnings for 2005; Fourth Quarter EPS Exceeds Guidance; 2006 Guidance Signals Strong Momentum GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 21, 2006--GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME)(NYSE:GME.B), the world's largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today reported record sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and full year ended January 28, 2006. Fourth Quarter Financial Results Earnings were $85.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, including merger- related expenses of $2.3 million ($1.4 million, net of tax benefits), as compared to earnings of $34.5 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $1.10 for the fourth quarter of 2005, including merger-related expenses of $0.02 per diluted share, as compared to $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year quarter, significantly exceeding prior guidance. GameStop sales increased 135.2% to $1,666.9 million in the fourth quarter, in comparison to $708.7 million in the prior year quarter, which was primarily due to the addition of the Electronics Boutique stores acquired in October 2005. On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 0.3% during the fourth quarter. Full Year Financial Results Earnings were $100.8 million for fiscal 2005, including merger-related expenses of $21.1 million ($13.3 million, net of tax benefits), as compared to earnings of $60.9 million in fiscal 2004. Diluted earnings per share were $1.61 for fiscal 2005, including merger related expenses of $0.21 per diluted share, as compared to $1.05 per diluted share in 2004. GameStop sales were $3,091.8 million for fiscal 2005, an increase of 67.8% over fiscal 2004 sales of $1,842.8 million. On a comparable store basis, sales decreased 1.4% during fiscal 2005. "2005 was an exceptional year for GameStop and our shareholders," indicated R. Richard Fontaine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Class A shares began the fiscal year at $18.90 and closed fiscal 2005 at $39.14, a 107% increase, and have continued to rise in 2006. Clearly, our merger with EB Games in October was well received in the market and, I believe, is a reflection of our outstanding position and immense potential in a growing business." "We achieved record sales, increased gross margins, and kept expenses well under control in the midst of explosive growth. Our operating margins increased to 6.2%, and net earnings for the year surpassed $100 million," reported Fontaine. "Tight execution of our integration plans have already begun to yield significant synergies and have resulted in improved cash flow with a year end cash balance of over $400 million." "GameStop's market share has grown every year," noted Fontaine. "And with the merger completed, we now have a 21% share of all new video game sales in the U.S. according to the NPD Group." "We continue to define ourselves as a growth company. That commitment was never more evident than in 2005, when we opened 792 new stores, including 450 in the U.S. and 342 internationally," remarked Fontaine. "In 2006, we plan to open 400 new stores, slowing slightly to give our field organization time to digest all of the changes of the integration, and ramp up to an estimated 600 stores in each of the next two years." "We have an excellent and deep management team, our business plan is sound, and our opportunities are great. We are very excited about the future of GameStop," concluded Fontaine. Business Outlook For fiscal 2006 (the 53-week year ending February 3, 2007), sales are projected to grow between 14.0% and 17.0% on a pro forma basis, with comparable store sales increasing from +6.0% to +9.0%, highlighted by the anticipated launches of Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Revolution in November. Diluted earnings per share for the full year are expected to range from $1.83 to $1.93, including projected stock-based compensation expense of $21.2 million ($13.4 million, net of tax benefits), or $0.17 per diluted share. Excluding projected stock-based compensation, full year diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $2.00 to $2.10. For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the company expects comparable store sales to range from -7.0% to -9.0%, due primarily to the launch of Sony's PSP in the prior year quarter, while diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.04 to $0.05, including expected stock-based compensation expense of $5.2 million ($3.2 million, net of tax benefit), or $0.04 per diluted share. This compares to a pro forma loss of $0.01 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Synergies related to the merger with Electronics Boutique remain on schedule and the company now forecasts savings ranging from $70 to $80 million in fiscal 2006. These synergies represent the elimination of duplicate general office and warehousing costs, advertising efficiencies, freight savings, benefits from applying GameStop's merchandising algorithms to EB's used video game category, and other fixed cost savings. Including projected pro forma fiscal 2006 EPS growth of 81%, the company currently expects that EPS could grow approximately 25% annually for each of the next three years based upon expected strong video game industry fundamentals, continued merger synergies and excellent cash generation. Note that guidance does not include merger costs related to the business combination. Fiscal 2005 pro forma statements of operations have been provided in Schedule C as if the acquisition of Electronics Boutique Holding Corp. took place at the beginning of fiscal 2005. In addition, the pro forma statements of operations include stock-based compensation expense as if SFAS No. 123(R) was implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2005.
