EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release of GameStop Corp., dated May 18, 2006. 4

Exhibit 99.1 GameStop Corp. First Quarter EPS of $0.15 Exceeds Guidance; Operating Earnings Surge 126%; New Software Sales Stronger Than Expected; GameStop Increases Fiscal 2006 Outlook GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 18, 2006--GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) (NYSE:GME.B), the world's largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today reported record sales and earnings for the first quarter ended April 29, 2006. GameStop net earnings were $11.7 million for the first quarter of 2006, including merger-related expenses of $1.3 million ($0.8 million, net of tax benefits) and stock-based compensation of $5.2 million ($3.3 million, net of tax benefits). Diluted earnings per share were $0.15 for the first quarter of 2006, including merger-related expenses of $0.01 per diluted share and stock-based compensation of $0.04 per diluted share. This compares to previously released guidance of $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share. Operating earnings surged 126% to $38.1 million. Total company sales increased 119% to $1,040.0 million in comparison to $474.7 million in the prior year quarter. Comparable store sales decreased 3.3% during the first quarter, beating previously announced guidance of -7.0% to -9.0% due to strong sell-thru of Microsoft Xbox 360 titles such as Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion from Take 2 Interactive and Ghost Recon: Advanced War Fighter from Ubisoft, as well as our best-selling title of the quarter, Square Enix's Kingdom Hearts II for Sony's PlayStation 2. "Our exceptionally strong results this quarter are due primarily to the improved flow of Xbox 360 hardware, early acceptance of the $59.99 price point for next generation software, and the successful completion of key integration strategies between GameStop and EB Games," indicated R. Richard Fontaine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "While there is more work that needs to be done to fully complete the merger, we have concluded many critical facets of the integration, including the roll out of GameStop's inventory management system to EB stores, applying best practices to the company's operations, the closing of the West Chester general office and the Coatesville distribution center, and restructuring of field management. We continue to have great confidence in our new and used business model as an earnings driver while the industry moves through the transformation to multiple new hardware platforms." "Our success in the first quarter comes just one year following the original public announcement of our merger with EB Games," continued Fontaine. "We have followed an extremely efficient and productive plan of integration, are ahead of schedule and in position to maximize the upside potential of the business over the remainder of the year." Updated Guidance For the second quarter of fiscal 2006, comparable store sales are projected to range from -2.0% to +1.0%. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter are expected to range from $0.04 to $0.05, including projected stock-based compensation expense of $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding projected stock-based compensation, second quarter diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.08 to $0.09. Due to the strong results in the first quarter, we are raising our full year fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share expectations to range from $1.93 to $2.03, including projected stock-based compensation expense of $0.17 per diluted share. Excluding projected stock-based compensation, full year diluted earnings per share are now expected to range from $2.10 to $2.20. Note that guidance does not include merger costs related to the business combination, which we project could range from $0.03 to $0.05 per diluted share for fiscal 2006. First quarter fiscal 2005 pro forma statements of operations have been provided in Schedule III as if the acquisition of Electronics Boutique Holding Corp. took place at the beginning of fiscal 2005. In addition, the pro forma statements of operations include stock-based compensation expense as if SFAS No. 123(R) was implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2005.
