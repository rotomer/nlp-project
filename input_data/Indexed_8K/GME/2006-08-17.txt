Exhibit 99.1 GameStop Corp. Second Quarter Sales Surge 132%; Comparable Store Sales Increase 3.9%; Second Quarter EPS Exceeds Guidance; Merger Integration Complete GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 17, 2006--GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME)(NYSE:GME.B), the world's largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today reported sales and earnings for the second quarter ended July 29, 2006. Company sales increased 132% to $963.3 million, when compared with $415.9 million in sales from the prior year quarter, with comparable store sales increasing 3.9%. New video game software increased 8% over the prior year quarter, with NEW SUPER MARIO BROS. from Nintendo and NCAA FOOTBALL '07 from Electronic Arts topping the list of best-selling new titles for the quarter. GameStop's net earnings for the second quarter of 2006 were $3.2 million, including merger-related expenses of $2.6 million ($1.6 million, net of tax benefits). Diluted earnings per share were $0.04, including merger-related expenses of $0.02 per diluted share, exceeding previously released guidance. "The outstanding execution by our store associates in the second quarter accelerated the adoption of Nintendo's new DS Lite hand-held system and the sell through of Microsoft's Xbox 360 console," indicated R. Richard Fontaine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GameStop Corp. "Our 56% increase in hardware sales during the quarter is particularly notable as the performance and momentum clearly positions GameStop as the major launch partner for Sony and Nintendo with the release later this year of their PlayStation 3 and Wii consoles." "A major milestone of the quarter was completing the integration of GameStop and Electronics Boutique. It is a testimony to the hard work and partnership of all our team members that, with the recently completed installation of a singular, unified POS system, we have completed the integration of two sizable companies, and did so on time and without any disruptions to our business nor deterioration in customer service," concluded Chairman Fontaine. "Without a doubt, we are excited about the new platform launches and the exceptional franchise titles being released in the upcoming months," indicated Daniel DeMatteo, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of GameStop Corp. "In fact, when you look at the range of new titles, starting with next week's release of MADDEN NFL '07 from Electronic Arts, and continuing with FINAL FANTASY XII by Square Enix, LEGEND OF ZELDA: TWILIGHT PRINCESS from Nintendo and GEARS OF WAR by Microsoft, we are looking at one of the best lineups in years for all platforms." Guidance Update For the third quarter of fiscal 2006, comparable store sales are projected to range from +4.0% to +6.0%. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter are expected to range from $0.20 to $0.22. Full year fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share are now expected to range from $1.94 to $2.04. We continue to believe that full year fiscal 2006 comparable store sales will increase between 7% and 9%, and total sales will increase between 15% and 17%, on a pro forma basis. Note that guidance includes projected stock-based compensation expenses of $0.17 per diluted share for fiscal 2006. Note that guidance does not include merger costs related to the business combination, which we project could range from $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share for fiscal 2006. Second quarter fiscal 2005 pro forma statements of operations have been provided in Schedule III as if the acquisition of Electronics Boutique Holding Corp. took place at the beginning of fiscal 2005. In addition, the pro forma statements of operations include stock-based compensation expense as if SFAS No. 123R was implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2005.

The conference call will be simulcast on the Internet at (http://www.gamestop.com/investor-relations/). The conference call will be archived on the website until August 31, 2006. About GameStop Corp.
