Exhibit 99.1 GameStop Corp. Comparable Store Sales Up 8.8% Third Quarter 2006 EPS at High End of Guidance Strong Holiday Guidance Issued GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 21, 2006--GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME)(NYSE:GME.B), the world's largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today reported sales and earnings for the third quarter ended October 28, 2006. GameStop sales increased 89% to $1,011.6 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared with $534.2 million in the prior year quarter. Comparable store sales increased 8.8% during the quarter, exceeding our previously indicated guidance. New video game software sales grew 14%, led by titles such as MADDEN NFL 2007 from Electronic Arts, SAINTS ROW by THQ, DEAD RISING by Capcom, and SPLINTER CELL: DOUBLE AGENT by Ubisoft. In addition, hardware sales increased 69% over the prior year quarter, led by Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's DS Lite. GameStop's net earnings for the third quarter of 2006 were $13.6 million. This includes merger-related expenses of $2.9 million ($1.8 million, net of tax benefits) and debt retirement costs related to the bond buy-back program of $3.4 million ($2.1 million, net of tax benefits). Diluted earnings per share were $0.17, including merger-related expenses and debt retirement costs of $0.05 per diluted share. "Not only did we have an excellent third quarter, but the sales during the period indicate that GameStop is building momentum heading into the holiday season," reported R. Richard Fontaine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GameStop Corp. "Strong sales of Microsoft's Xbox 360, an unexpected resilient performance from Sony's PlayStation 2, and robust sales of Nintendo's DS Lite reflect a growing installed base of game customers measured by our 69% increase in hardware sales. We have a contemporary platform attracting core customers, a seven year-old platform attracting a value customer, hand-helds attracting a broader demographic gamer, and the latest revolutionary systems just coming to the market. Never before in video game history have we had so many outstanding consoles to energize the existing gamers, entice the upgrade customer, and attract new customers to gaming and GameStop." Guidance Update For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, comparable store sales are projected to range from +14.0% to +18.0%. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter are expected to range from $1.53 to $1.59. Full year fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share are now expected to range from $1.98 to $2.04. We continue to believe that full year fiscal 2006 comparable store sales will increase between 7.0% and 9.0%, and total sales will increase between 15.0% and 17.0%, both on a pro forma basis. Note that guidance includes projected stock-based compensation expenses of $0.17 per diluted share for fiscal 2006. In addition, guidance does not include merger costs related to the business combination, which were $0.05 per diluted share for fiscal 2006, nor debt retirement costs, which could range from $0.03 to $0.05 per diluted share for fiscal 2006. Third quarter fiscal 2005 pro forma statements of operations have been provided in Schedule III as if the acquisition of Electronics Boutique Holding Corp. took place at the beginning of fiscal 2005. In addition, the pro forma statements of operations include stock-based compensation expense as if SFAS No. 123(R) was implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2005. GameStop will report holiday sales on or about January 4, 2007.

Safe Harbor This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and beyond, future financial and operating results, projected store openings, the company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of GameStop's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the risk that the cost savings and other synergies from the combination with Electronics Boutique may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of product to meet consumer demand, including Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii; the timing of release of video game titles for next generation consoles; and economic and other events that could reduce or impact consumer demand.
