Exhibit 99.1 GameStop Sales Top $5 Billion 2006 Sales and Net Earnings Grow 72% and 57% Fourth Quarter EPS Exceeds Guidance Comparable Store Sales Increase 26.5% for Q4 and 11.9% for Year Issues Robust 2007 Guidance and Reaffirms Long Range EPS Growth Targets GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 27, 2007--GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), the world's largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today reported sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year ended February 3, 2007. Please note that all per share data has been adjusted for the Class B share conversion and the two-for-one stock split that occurred subsequent to February 3, 2007. Fourth Quarter Financial Results Net earnings were $129.8 million for the 14-week fourth quarter of 2006, including debt retirement costs related to the bond buy-back program of $2.5 million ($1.6 million, net of tax benefits), as compared to net earnings of $85.0 million for the 13-week fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of 52.7%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.81, including debt retirement costs of $0.01 per diluted share, compared to $0.55 per diluted share in the prior year quarter, considerably beating guidance issued on January 4, 2007. Brisk sales in January of Vivendi's WORLD OF WARCRAFT and new video game software titles drove the greater than anticipated results. GameStop sales increased 38.2% to $2,304.0 million in the fourth quarter, in comparison to $1,666.9 million in the prior year quarter. On a comparable store basis, sales increased 26.5% during the fourth quarter. Full Year Financial Results Net earnings were $158.3 million for the 53-week fiscal year 2006, including merger-related expenses of $6.8 million ($4.3 million, net of tax benefits) and debt retirement costs of $6.1 million ($3.8 million, net of tax benefits), as compared to earnings of $100.8 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of 57.0%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.00 for fiscal 2006, including merger related expenses and debt retirement costs of $0.05 per diluted share, as compared to $0.81 per diluted share in fiscal 2005. GameStop sales were $5,318.9 million for fiscal 2006, an increase of 72.0% over fiscal 2005 sales of $3,091.8 million. On a comparable store basis, sales increased 11.9% during fiscal 2006. "2006 was a remarkable year for GameStop. Total sales increased 72%, operating earnings grew by 73%, net earnings were up 57%, and comparable store sales increased 12%; by any retail measurement, a remarkable year," indicated R. Richard Fontaine, GameStop's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition, we finished the year with a strong balance sheet and a year end cash balance of over $650 million. "During the year we successfully and fully integrated over 2,000 EB Games stores into the GameStop portfolio and opened 421 new stores worldwide; 276 in the United States and 145 in the international divisions. In fact, our internal rate of return for new stores was the highest ever and, in aggregate, significantly exceeded plan. "While we are in the very early stages of another strong growth cycle, it is not a mirror of the past. In fact, our 2007 guidance is based on our belief that this cycle will be deeper, wider, and longer than any previous period of new console introductions. From the technology powerhouses of Xbox 360 and PS3, to the uniquely engaging ease of play and inventiveness of the Wii, to the portability of the DS Lite, to the value of the PS2, there is a product and a price range to stimulate the core and casual gamer, and attract new customers to the video game experience," continued Fontaine. "No previous cycle has had the diversity of console attributes currently in our stores; no previous cycle has merged other technologies like HDTV, Wi-Fi, and MP3 attributes to make the gaming experience truly the best ever. "The video game business has become more complex with more console choices, more sophisticated software, and a huge variety of enhancement accessories. The business is increasingly favoring the game passion and deep expertise of our 22,000 managers and game advisors whose product knowledge differentiates GameStop from the competition and will give us an even greater edge in the marketplace of the future." Business Outlook For fiscal 2007 (the 52-week year ending February 2, 2008), sales are projected to grow between 19.0% and 21.0%, with comparable store sales ranging from +14.0% to +16.0%, backed by a strong release slate of video game titles across all platforms. Diluted earnings per share for the full year are expected to range from $1.37 to $1.40. GameStop expects to open between 500-550 stores worldwide in 2007. For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the company expects comparable store sales to range from +12.0% to +14.0%, driven by the expected launches of Sony's PlayStation 3 in Europe and Australia, Sony's GOD OF WAR II for the PlayStation 2 in the U.S., the worldwide launch of Nintendo's POKEMON DIAMOND and PEARL for the Nintendo DS, as well as continued strong demand for Microsoft Xbox 360 titles. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.15 to $0.16. This compares to earnings per share of $0.07 in the first quarter of 2006. Based on expected strong video game industry fundamentals, the company's expanding worldwide retail portfolio, and sound cash generation, GameStop currently expects earnings per share to grow at least 25% annually in fiscals 2008 and 2009. Note that guidance does not include debt retirement costs. Fourth quarter and full year 2005 pro forma statements of operations have been provided in Schedules III and IV as if the acquisition of Electronics Boutique Holding Corp. took place at the beginning of fiscal 2005. In addition, the pro forma statements of operations include stock-based compensation expense as if SFAS No. 123(R) was implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2005.
