Exhibit 99.1 GameStop Reports Best Ever First Quarter Results; First Quarter EPS Exceeds Guidance; Net Earnings Increase 111%; Robust Sales of Next-Generation Hardware Drive Quarter; Fiscal 2007 EPS Guidance Raised GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 23, 2007--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the world's largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended May 5, 2007. Please note that all per share data has been adjusted for the Class B share conversion and the two-for-one stock split that occurred subsequent to February 3, 2007. GameStop's net earnings were $24.7 million for the first quarter of 2007, including debt retirement costs of $6.7 million ($4.2 million, net of tax benefits), an 111% increase over the first quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share were $0.15 for the first quarter of 2007, including debt retirement costs of $0.03 per diluted share, exceeding previously released guidance. Total company sales increased 23.0% to $1,279.0 million in comparison to $1,040.0 million in the prior year quarter. Comparable store sales increased 15.3% during the first quarter, also beating previously released guidance of 12.0% to 14.0%. Hardware sales grew 75.1% in the first quarter, driven by overwhelming demand for Nintendo's Wii and DS Lite systems, and strong sales of Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PS3. R. Richard Fontaine, GameStop's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Our first quarter results were driven by the strong growth of next generation hardware despite both Nintendo products, the Wii and DS Lite, being in short supply throughout the quarter. Our business is benefiting from unmatched platform expansion. For much of the quarter, seven different platforms were represented among our top 25 best sellers. Not only was this unprecedented, but there is every indication that the Wii and DS Lite titles are attracting a new audience of gamers, while the allure of genre breakthrough titles like Guitar Hero II are expanding the audience for video game product. "The quarter also reflected strong operational control and efficiencies. Our operating margins increased by 100 basis points even in the face of lower gross margins due to the very strong sale of lower margin hardware. SG&A expenses decreased by 260 basis points due to the excellent expense leveraging of our increasing sales, continued distribution efficiencies as a result of our synergies from the EB Games merger, and an improved system of in-store scheduling. "I am also happy to announce that during the first quarter GameStop was added to the Fortune 500 list of largest U.S. corporations," concluded Fontaine. The top selling video games during the quarter were Nintendo's POKEMON DIAMOND and PEARL, Sony's GOD OF WAR II, Activision's GUITAR HERO II, Microsoft's CRACKDOWN, and Ubisoft's GHOST RECON: ADVANCED WARFIGHTER 2. Updated Guidance For the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the company expects comparable store sales to range from +16.0% to +18.0%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.07 to $0.08. This compares to earnings per share of $0.02 in the second quarter of 2006. Due to the excellent results in the first quarter, we are raising our full year 2007 diluted earnings per share guidance to range from $1.39 to $1.42. Total revenues are still projected to grow between 19.0% and 21.0%, with comparable store sales ranging from +14.0% to +16.0%. Note that guidance does not include debt retirement costs.
