Exhibit 99.1
GameStop Increases Full Year 2007 Guidance
Preliminary Fourth Quarter Comps of 17.4% Exceed Expectations
GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today increased earnings guidance for the fiscal year ending February 2, 2008.
After a stronger than expected January, GameStop is increasing its fourth quarter and full year diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.02 to now range between $1.11 to $1.12 and $1.77 to $1.78, respectively. Driven by impressive domestic and international sales, and in spite of temporary industry-wide video game system shortages, preliminary comparable store sales for the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations and came in at a very strong 17.4%.
Note that guidance does not include debt retirement costs.
Full year 2007 sales and earnings results and fiscal 2008 earnings guidance will be released in mid-March 2008.
