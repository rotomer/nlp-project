Updated Guidance
Based on the stronger than expected results in the second quarter of 2008 and increased confidence in the second half video game line-up, GameStop is increasing its fiscal 2008 guidance.
Full year diluted earnings per share are now forecast to range from $2.45 to $2.50, representing a +36% to +39% growth rate over last year. Comparable store sales are projected to increase between +12% and +14% for the full year, with total sales growing between +23% and +25%.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2008, GameStop is forecasting diluted earnings per share to range from $0.36 to $0.38, representing EPS growth of +9% to +15%. Comparable store sales in the third quarter are expected to range from flat to +2%.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, GameStop is forecasting diluted earnings per share to range from $1.37 to $1.40, representing EPS growth of +20% to +23%. Comparable store sales in the fourth quarter are expected to range from +8% to +10%.
GameStop continues to believe that fiscal 2009 earnings per share will grow at least 25%. This guidance is based on our analysis that the unprecedented growth of new video game hardware during 2007 and 2008, combined with strong tie ratios, significant industry investment, and a great title line-up will drive new video game software sales to double-digit growth resulting in higher profitability for the company.
Note that guidance does not include debt retirement costs.
