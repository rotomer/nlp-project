Within twenty-four (24) hours of the termination of his relationship with the Company, Executive promises to return to the Company any Recipient Materials that are in his possession, custody or control, regardless of whether such Materials are located in Executive's office, automobile, or home or on Executive's business or personal computers. Executive also shall authorize and permit the Company to inspect all computer drives used or maintained by Executive during his employment or consulting at the Company and, if necessary, to permit the Company to delete any Recipient Materials or Proprietary Information contained on such drives.

EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
-Page 6
develops regarding matters that are within the scope of the Company's business operations or that relate to research and development on behalf of the Company, and agrees to maintain any records necessary to inform the Company of such business opportunities. All Company Information and other Company documents and materials maintained or entrusted to Executive shall remain the exclusive property of the Company at all times; such materials shall, together with all copies thereof, be returned and delivered to the Company by Executive immediately without demand, upon termination of Executive's relationship with the Company, and shall be returned at a prior time if the Company so demands.
 
c.         
No Interference with Employee/Independent Contractor Relationships
.
Executive agrees that, through the later of (i) the expiration (but not earlier termination) of the three-year term (or any one-year renewal term) of this Agreement or (ii) two years after Executive's employment with the Company ceases, Executive will not, either directly or indirectly, participate in recruiting or hiring away any employees or independent contractors of the Company, or encourage or induce any employees, agents, independent contractors or investors of the Company to terminate their relationship with the Company, unless given the prior written consent of the Board to do so.
 
d.         
No Interference with Client/Customer Relationships
.
Executive agrees that, through the later of (i) the expiration (but not earlier termination) of the three-year term (or any one-year renewal term) of this Agreement or (ii) two years after Executive's employment with the Company ceases, Executive will not induce or attempt to induce any client or customer of the Company to diminish, curtail, divert, or cancel its business relationship with the Company. The restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall apply worldwide, which the parties stipulate is a reasonable geographic area because of the scope of the Company's operations and Executive's activities.
 
e.         
No Unfair Competition
.
Executive agrees that, through the later of (i) the expiration (but not earlier termination) of the three-year term (or any one-year renewal term) of this Agreement or (ii) two years after Executive's employment with the Company ceases, Executive will not participate in, work for, or assist a Competing Business in any capacity (as owner, employee, consultant, contractor, officer, director, lender, investor, agent, or otherwise), unless given the prior written consent of the Board to do so. The restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall apply worldwide, which the parties stipulate is a reasonable geographic area because of the scope of the Company's operations and Executive's activities. This paragraph creates a narrowly tailored advance approval requirement in order to avoid unfair competition and irreparable harm to the Company and is not intended or to be construed as a general restraint from engaging in a lawful profession or a general covenant against competition, and is ancillary to the Company's agreement contained herein to employ Executive for a definite term. Nothing herein will prohibit ownership of less than 5% of the publicly traded capital stock of a corporation so long as this is not a controlling interest, or ownership of mutual fund investments. Executive acknowledges and agrees that this subsection e is reasonable and necessary to protect the trade secrets, confidential information and goodwill of the Company.
 
f.         
Remedies
.
In the event of breach or threatened breach by Executive of any provision of Section 9 hereof, the Company shall be entitled to: (i) injunctive relief by
 
EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
-Page 7
temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, and/or permanent injunction; (ii) recovery of all attorneys' fees and costs incurred by the Company in obtaining such relief; and (iii) any other legal and equitable relief to which may be entitled, including, without limitation, any and all monetary damages that the Company may incur as a result of said breach or threatened breach, in each case without the necessity of posting any bond. The Company may pursue any remedy available, including declaratory relief, concurrently or consecutively in any order as to any breach, violation, or threatened breach or violation, and the pursuit of one such remedy at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other remedy.
 
h.         
Early Resolution Conference
. This Agreement is understood to be clear and enforceable as written and is executed by both parties on that basis. However, should Executive later challenge any provision as unclear, unenforceable or inapplicable to any competitive activity that Executive intends to engage in, Executive will first notify the Company in writing and meet with a Company representative and a neutral mediator (if the Company elects to retain one at its expense) to discuss resolution of any disputes between the parties. Executive will provide this notification at least fourteen (14) days before Executive engages in any activity on behalf of a Competing Business or engages in other activity that could foreseeably fall within a questioned restriction. The failure to comply with this requirement shall waive Executive's right to challenge the reasonable scope, clarity, applicability, or enforceability of the Agreement and its restrictions at a later time. All rights of both parties will be preserved if the Early Resolution Conference requirement is complied with even if no agreement is reached in the conference.
 
10.       
Merger or Acquisition Disposition and Assignment
.
In the event the Company should consolidate, or merge into another entity, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets or operations to another Person, or divide its assets or operations among a number of entities, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with regard to the surviving entity and may be assigned by the Company if necessary to achieve this purpose. Executive's obligations under this Agreement are personal in nature and may not be assigned by Executive to another Person.
 
11.       
Notices
.
All notices, requests, consents, and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date personally delivered or on the date deposited in a receptacle maintained by the United States Postal Service for such purpose, postage prepaid, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by express mail or overnight courier, addressed to the address indicated under the signature block for that party provided below. Either party may designate a different address by providing written notice of a new address to the other party.
 
12.       
Severability
.
If any provision contained in this Agreement is determined to be void, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, in whole or in part, then the other provisions contained herein shall remain in full force and effect as if the provision that was determined to be void, illegal, or unenforceable had not been contained herein. In making any such determination, the determining court shall deem any such provision to be modified so as to give it the maximum effect permitted by applicable law.

13.

16.
