On November 12, 2008, GameStop Corp. ("GameStop"), together with certain of GameStop's direct or indirect subsidiaries (the "Borrowers"), entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the "Term Loan Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as lender, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and Bank of America Securities LLC, as Sole Arranger and Bookrunner.
 
The Term Loan Agreement provides for term loans in the aggregate of $150,000,000, consisting of a $50,000,000 secured term loan ("Term Loan A") and a $100,000,000 unsecured term loan ("Term Loan B" and together with Term Loan A, the "Term Loans"). The Term Loan Agreement provides that the principal of Term Loan B will be repaid in four equal installments of $25,000,000 a week for four consecutive weeks, commencing on December 3, 2008. Term Loan A matures on March 31, 2009. Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Agreement may not be reborrowed once repaid. Borrowings made pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement will bear interest, payable quarterly or, if earlier, at the end of any interest period, at either (a) the prime loan rate, described in the Term Loan Agreement as the higher of (i) Bank of America N.A.'s prime rate or (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, in each case plus 1.75% or (b) the LIBO rate (a publicly published rate) plus 3.75%.
 
The Term Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of this type, including limitations on GameStop and its subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, changes of business and transactions with affiliates. The covenants permit GameStop to use proceeds of the Term Loans for working capital, capital expenditures, the payment of transaction costs and a portion of the consideration in connection with the Micromania Acquisition (as defined in item 2.01 below) and for all other lawful corporate purposes.
 
The Term Loan Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any material representation or warranty made by GameStop or the other Borrowers proving to be false in any material respect, certain bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership events affecting GameStop or its subsidiaries, defaults relating to certain other indebtedness, imposition of certain judgments and a change in control of GameStop (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement).
 
In the event of a default by GameStop, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of Lenders shall, declare all obligations under the Term Loan Agreement immediately due and payable, and enforce any and all rights of the Lenders or Administrative Agent under the Term Loan Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency and receivership, the commitments of Lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of GameStop will become immediately due and payable.
 
The foregoing description of the Term Loan Agreement and related matters is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Term Loan Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Term Loan A is secured by substantially all of GameStop's and certain of its subsidiaries' assets, including, without limitation, (i) inventory, (ii) accounts receivable (including credit card receivables), (iii) general intangibles (including trade names, trademarks and other intellectual property), (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment, (v) bank and investment accounts, (vi) investment property (including a pledge of subsidiary stock), (vii) owned real estate, (viii) claims and causes of
 
2
action relating to the foregoing accounts receivable, certain intellectual property and the capital stock and other equity interests of certain of GameStop's direct and indirect subsidiaries pursuant to (a) a Security Agreement, dated November 12, 2008 (the "Security Agreement"), which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference, and (b) a Patent and Trademark Security Agreement, dated as of November 12, 2008 (the "IP Security Agreement"), which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, each of GameStop, Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp., GameStop Holdings Corp., GameStop, Inc., GameStop (LP), LLC, GameStop of Texas (GP), LLC and EB International Holdings, Inc. has entered into the Securities Collateral Pledge Agreement, dated November 12, 2008 (the "Pledge Agreement"), pledging certain interests in certain subsidiaries, which is filed as Exhibit 10.4 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Term Loan Agreement is junior to GameStop's senior credit facility, and the liens created by the Security Agreement, Pledge Agreement and IP Security Agreement in favor of the Term Loan A Lenders are junior to, the liens created under the senior credit facility.
 
In connection with the Term Loans, GameStop entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to its senior credit facility amending its senior credit facility to permit the Micromania Acquisition and the Term Loans. In addition, during the term of the Term Loan, the applicable margin under the senior credit facility (i) payable on LIBO Loans is increased to a range of 150 basis points to 200 basis points from the current ranges of 100 basis points to 150 basis points and (ii) payable on Prime Rate Loans is increased to a range of 50 basis points to 75 basis points from the current range of 0 basis points to 25 basis points. The margins applicable prior to the entry into the Amendment shall apply once the Term Loans are no longer outstanding. The foregoing description of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.5 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Certain of the Lenders party to the Term Loan Agreement, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform for GameStop and its subsidiaries, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.
 
 
On November 17, 2008, GameStop France SAS, a wholly owned subsidiary of GameStop, completed the approximately $636 million (EUR 497 million) acquisition of substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of SFMI Micromania ("Micromania") from L Capital, LV Capital, Europe@web and other shareholders of Micromania (the "Micromania Acquisition"). Micromania is a leading retailer of video and computer games in France with 332 locations. In connection with the Micromania Acquisition, the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated September 30, 2008 entered into in connection therewith (included as Exhibit 2.1 to GameStop's Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 1, 2008), was amended in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10.6 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 "Entry into a Material Agreement" of GameStop's current report on Form 8-K dated October 1, 2008 is incorporated in this Item 2.01 by reference.

23
this Agreement, provided that, if the Borrowers request an amendment to any provision hereof to reflect the effect of any change occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such provision shall have been amended in accordance herewith.
(a)       Each Term Loan A Lender, severally and not jointly with any other Lender, agrees, upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, to make a term loan in the aggregate amount of up to $50,000,000 (collectively, the "
Term Loan A
") to the Borrowers in a single drawing on the Closing Date in an amount equal to such Term Loan A Lender's Term Loan A Commitment. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan A shall not at any time exceed the aggregate amount of the Term Loan A Commitments. The Term Loan A Commitments shall be terminated upon the funding on the Term Loan A on the Closing Date. Any portion of the Term Loan A that is repaid may not be reborrowed. Except as set forth in Section 2.8 and Section 2.16, any outstanding portion of the Term Loan A may be either a Prime Rate Loan or a LIBO Loan.
(b)       Each Term Loan B Lender, severally and not jointly with any other Lender, agrees, upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, to make a term loan in the aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000 (collectively, the "
Term Loan B
") to the Borrowers in a single drawing on the Closing Date in an amount equal to such Term Loan B Lender's Term Loan B Commitment. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan B shall not at any time exceed the aggregate amount of the Term Loan B Commitments. The Term Loan B Commitments shall be terminated upon the funding on the Term Loan B on the Closing Date. Any portion of the Term Loan B that is repaid may not be reborrowed. Except as set forth in Section 2.8 and Section 2.16, any outstanding portion of the Term Loan B may be either a Prime Rate Loan or a LIBO Loan.
(c)       The failure of any Lender to make its portion of the Term Loan A or the Term Loan B, as applicable, shall neither relieve any other Lender of its obligation to fund its portion of the Term Loan A or the Term Loan B, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement nor increase the obligation of any such other Lender.
 
24
(a)       Except as set forth in Sections 2.8 and 2.16, the Term Loans made by the Lenders shall be either Prime Rate Loans or LIBO Loans as the Lead Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers may request subject to and in accordance with this Section 2.2. Each Lender may fulfill its Commitment with respect to any Term Loan by causing any lending office of such Lender to make such Term Loan; but any such use of a lending office shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Term Loan in accordance with the terms of the applicable Term Note. Each Lender shall, subject to its overall policy considerations, use reasonable efforts (but shall not be obligated) to select a lending office which will not result in the payment of increased costs by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.15.
(b)       The Lead Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent three (3) Business Days' prior telephonic notice (thereafter confirmed in writing) of each borrowing of LIBO Loans and one (1) Business Day's prior notice of each borrowing of Prime Rate Loans. Any such notice, to be effective, must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the third Business Day in the case of LIBO Loans prior to, and on the first Business Day in the case of Prime Rate Loans prior to, the date on which such borrowing is to be made. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the amount of the proposed borrowing (which shall be in an integral multiple of $100,000, but not less than $1,000,000 in the case of LIBO Loans) and the date thereof (which shall be a Business Day) and shall contain disbursement instructions. Such notice shall specify whether the interest rate then being requested with respect to such portion of the Term Loans is to be the Prime Rate or the LIBO Rate and, with respect to LIBO Loans, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no election of Interest Period is specified in any such notice for LIBO Loans, such notice shall be deemed a request for an Interest Period of one month. If no election is made as to whether the outstanding portion of the applicable Term Loan shall be a Prime Rate Loan or a LIBO Loan, such notice shall be deemed a request for a Prime Rate Loan. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of its proportionate share of such Term Loan, the date of such Term Loan, the Type of such Term Loan being requested and the Interest Period or Interest Periods applicable thereto, as appropriate. On the Closing Date, each Lender shall make its share of the Term Loans available at the office of the Administrative Agent at 100 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, no later than 12:00 noon, New York time, in immediately available funds. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the Closing Date that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Term Loans on the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Term Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to
 
25
pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to Prime Rate Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's portion of the applicable Term Loan. Upon receipt of the funds made available by the Lenders to fund the Term Loans hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall disburse such funds in the manner specified in the notice of borrowing delivered by the Lead Borrower and shall use reasonable efforts to make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrowers no later than 3:00 p.m., New York time.
(c)       The Administrative Agent, without the request of the Lead Borrower, may request the Revolving Agent to (and the Revolving Agent is hereby authorized and directed to) advance any interest, fee, service charge, or other payment to which any Agent or their Affiliates or any Lender is entitled from any Borrower pursuant hereto or any other Loan Document. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lead Borrower of any such request promptly after the making thereof.
(a)       The Term Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by the Term Notes duly executed on behalf of the Borrowers, dated the Closing Date, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B-1
or
Exhibit B-2
, as applicable, payable to the order of each such Lender in an aggregate principal amount equal to such Lender's Term Loan A Commitment or Term Loan B Commitment, as applicable.
(b)       Each Lender is hereby authorized by the Borrower to endorse on a schedule attached to each Term Note delivered to such Lender (or on a continuation of such schedule attached to such Term Note and made a part thereof), or otherwise to record in such Lender's internal records, an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each Term Loan from such Lender, each payment and prepayment of principal of any such Term Loan, each payment of interest on any such Term Loan and the other information provided for on such schedule;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Lender to make such a notation or any error therein shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Term Loans made by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Term Notes.
(c)       Upon receipt of an affidavit of a Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such Lender's Term Note and an indemnity in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Borrower, and upon cancellation of such Term Note, the Borrowers will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement Term Note in favor of such Lender, in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor.
 
26
(a)       Subject to Section 2.5, each portion of any Term Loan which is a Prime Rate Loan shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable) at a rate per annum that shall be equal to the then Prime Rate,
plus
the Applicable Margin for Prime Rate Loans.
(b)       Subject to Section 2.5, each portion of any Term Loan which is a LIBO Loan shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period,
plus
the Applicable Margin for LIBO Loans.
(c)       Accrued interest on the Term Loans shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto, on the Termination Date, after the Termination Date on demand and (with respect to LIBO Loans) upon any repayment or prepayment thereof (on the amount prepaid).
2.5       
Default Interest
. Effective upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and at all times thereafter while such Event of Default is continuing, at the option of the Administrative Agent or upon the direction of the Required Lenders, interest shall accrue on the outstanding Term Loans (after as well as before judgment, as and to the extent permitted by law), at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the rate (including the Applicable Margin) in effect from time to time plus 2.00% per annum, and such interest shall be payable on demand.
2.6       
Certain Fees
. The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Administrative Agent, the fees set forth in the Fee Letter as and when payment of such fees is due as therein set forth.
2.7       
Nature of Fees
. All fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent, for the respective accounts of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, as provided herein. All fees shall be fully earned on the date when due and shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
2.8       
Alternate Rate of Interest
. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for any portion of a Term Loan which is a LIBO Loan:
(a)       the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b)       the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the
 
27
cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their portion of the LIBO Loans for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lead Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter (but in any event, within two (2) Business Days) and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Lead Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any request of the Lead Borrower to convert any portion of a Term Loan to, or to continue any portion of a Term Loan as, a LIBO Loan shall be ineffective and (ii) any such portion of such Term Loan shall be converted to or continued as a Prime Rate Loan.
2.9       
Conversion and Continuation of Loans
. The Lead Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers shall have the right at any time,
(a)       on three (3) Business Days' prior irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice, to be effective, must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the third Business Day preceding the date of any conversion), (x) to convert any outstanding portion of a Term Loan which is a Prime Rate Loan to a LIBO Loan, or (y) to continue any outstanding portion of a Term Loan which is a LIBO Loan as a LIBO Loan for an additional Interest Period,
(b)       on one Business Day's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent (which notice, to be effective, must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., New York time, on the date of any conversion), to convert any outstanding portion of the a Term Loan which is a LIBO Loan to a Prime Rate Loan,
subject to the following:
(i)        no portion of the Term Loans may be converted into, or continued as, LIBO Loans at any time when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(ii)       the aggregate principal amount of any Term Loan being converted into or continued as LIBO Loans shall be in an integral of $100,000 and at least $1,000,000;
(iii)      each Lender shall effect each conversion by applying the proceeds of its new LIBO Loan or Prime Rate Loan, as the case may be, to its portion of the applicable Term Loan being so converted;
(iv)      the Interest Period with respect to LIBO Loans effected by a conversion or in respect to the LIBO Loans being continued as LIBO Loans shall commence on the date of conversion or the expiration of the current applicable Interest Period, as the case may be;
 
28
(v)       LIBO Loans may be converted only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto;
(vi)      each request for a conversion or continuation of LIBO Loans which fails to state an applicable Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one month; and
(vii)     no more than three (3) LIBO Loans may be outstanding at any time.
If the Lead Borrower does not give notice to convert any Prime Rate Loans, or does not give notice to continue, or does not have the right to continue, any LIBO Loans, in each case as provided above, such portion of the applicable Term Loan shall automatically be converted to, or continued as, as applicable, a Prime Rate Loan at the expiration of the then current Interest Period. The Administrative Agent shall, after it receives notice from the Borrower, promptly give each Lender notice of any conversion, in whole or part, of any portion of the applicable Term Loan made by such Lender.
(a)       The Borrowers shall repay the Term Loan B in four equal installments of $25,000,000 each on each of December 3, 2008, December 10, 2008, December 17, 2008 and December 24, 2008. Once repaid, no portion of the Term Loan B may be reborrowed.
(b)       The outstanding Obligations shall be subject to mandatory prepayment as follows:

(ii)       Subject to the foregoing, outstanding Prime Rate Loans shall be prepaid before outstanding LIBO Loans are prepaid. Each partial prepayment of LIBO Loans shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000. No prepayment of LIBO Loans shall be permitted pursuant to this Section 2.10 other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, unless the Borrowers simultaneously reimburse the Lenders for all "Breakage Costs" (as defined below) associated therewith. In order to avoid such Breakage Costs, as long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the request of the Lead Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall hold all amounts required to be applied to LIBO Loans in a cash collateral account and will apply such funds to the applicable
 
29
LIBO Loans at the end of the then pending Interest Period therefor and such LIBO Loans shall continue to bear interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.4 until the amounts in such cash collateral account have been so applied (provided that the foregoing shall in no way limit or restrict the Agents' rights upon the subsequent occurrence of an Event of Default). No partial prepayment of a Borrowing of LIBO Loans shall result in the aggregate principal amount of the LIBO Loans remaining outstanding pursuant to such Borrowing being less than $1,000,000 (unless all such outstanding LIBO Loans are being prepaid in full).
(c)       All amounts required to be applied to the Term Loans hereunder shall be applied ratably in accordance with each Lender's Commitment Percentage.

(i)        All prepayments under Section 2.10(b) above and under this Section 2.11 shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for application,
first
, to the prepayment of outstanding amounts under the Term Loan B ratably in accordance with each Term Loan B Lender's Term Loan B Commitment Percentage, and
second
, to the prepayment of outstanding amounts under the Term Loan A ratably in accordance with each Term Loan A Lender's Term Loan A Commitment Percentage.
(ii)       Subject to the foregoing, outstanding Prime Rate Loans shall be prepaid before outstanding LIBO Loans are prepaid. Each partial prepayment of LIBO Loans shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000. No prepayment of LIBO Loans shall be permitted pursuant to this Section 2.11 other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, unless the Borrowers simultaneously reimburse the Lenders for all "Breakage Costs" (as defined below) associated therewith. No partial prepayment of LIBO Loans shall result in the aggregate principal amount of the LIBO Loans remaining outstanding being less than $1,000,000 (unless all such outstanding LIBO Loans are being prepaid in full).
(iii)      Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount and Type of the Term Loans to be prepaid. Each notice of prepayment shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrowers to prepay such
 
30
portion of the Term Loan by the amount and on the date stated therein. The Administrative Agent shall, promptly after receiving notice from the Lead Borrower hereunder, notify each Lender of the principal amount and Type of the Term Loans held by such Lender which are to be prepaid, the prepayment date and the manner of application of the prepayment.
 
(b)       The Borrowers shall reimburse each Lender on demand for any loss incurred or to be incurred by it in the reemployment of the funds released (i) resulting from any prepayment (for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, conversion to Prime Rate Loans or acceleration by virtue of, and after, the occurrence of an Event of Default) of any LIBO Loan required or permitted under this Agreement, if such LIBO Loan is prepaid other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBO Loan or (ii) in the event that after the Lead Borrower delivers a notice of borrowing under Section 2.2 in respect of LIBO Loans, such LIBO Loans are not borrowed on the first day of the Interest Period specified in such notice of borrowing for any reason. Such loss shall be the amount as reasonably determined by such Lender as the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of interest which would have accrued to such Lender on the amount so paid or not borrowed at a rate of interest equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such LIBO Loan, for the period from the date of such payment or failure to borrow to the last day (x) in the case of a payment or refinancing of a LIBO Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBO Loan, of the then current Interest Period for such Loan or (y) in the case of such failure to borrow, of the Interest Period for such LIBO Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure to borrow, over (B) the amount of interest which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the London interbank market (collectively, "
Breakage Costs
"). Any Lender demanding reimbursement for such loss shall deliver to the Lead Borrower from time to time one or more certificates setting forth the amount of such loss as determined by such Lender and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount was determined.
(c)       In the event the Borrowers fail to prepay any portion of any Term Loan on the date specified in any prepayment notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.11(a), the Borrowers on demand by any Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any actual loss incurred by such Lender as a result of such failure to prepay, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expenses incurred by reason of the acquisition of deposits or other funds by such Lender to fulfill deposit obligations incurred in anticipation of such prepayment. Any Lender demanding such payment shall deliver to the Lead Borrower from time to time one or more certificates setting forth the amount of such loss as determined by such Lender and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount was determined.
 
31
(d)       Whenever any partial prepayment of the outstanding portion of the Term Loans are to be applied to LIBO Loans, such LIBO Loans shall be prepaid in the chronological order of their Interest Payment Dates.
(a)       The Administrative Agent shall maintain an account on its books in the name of the Borrowers (the "
Loan Account
") which will reflect (i) the outstanding amount of the Term Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrowers or for the Borrowers' account, (ii) all fees and interest that have become payable as herein set forth, and (iii) any and all other monetary Obligations that have become payable.
(b)       The Loan Account will be credited with all amounts received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers or otherwise for the Borrowers' account, and the amounts so credited shall be applied as set forth in Sections 2.14(a) and (b). After the end of each month, the Administrative Agent shall send to the Lead Borrower a statement accounting for the charges, loans, [and other transactions] occurring among and between the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrowers during that month. The monthly statements shall, absent manifest error, be an account stated, which is final, conclusive and binding on the Borrowers.
(a)       On or prior to the Closing Date, the Borrowers shall have entered into Blocked Account Agreements with the Blocked Account Banks in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall have the exclusive right to exercise control over the Blocked Accounts and to cause all proceeds received in the Blocked Accounts to pay the Obligations as set forth in Section 7.4 hereof.
(b)       The Borrowers may close DDAs or Blocked Accounts and/or open new DDAs or Blocked Accounts, subject to the execution and delivery to the Administrative Agent of appropriate Blocked Account Agreements consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.13. Unless consented to in writing by the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers may not enter into any agreements with additional credit card processors unless contemporaneously therewith, a notification to such processor instructing such processor to transfer the proceeds of such credit card charges in accordance with the provisions of this Section is executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent.
(c)       So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrowers may direct, and shall have sole control over, the manner of disposition of its funds in the DDA Accounts and the Blocked Accounts.
 
32
(d)       In the event that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.13, after the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Borrowers receive or otherwise have dominion and control of any such proceeds or collections, such proceeds and collections shall be held in trust by the Borrowers for the Administrative Agent and shall not be commingled with any of the Borrowers' other funds or deposited in any account of Borrower other than as instructed by the Administrative Agent.
(a)       As long as the time for payment of the Obligations has not been accelerated, all amounts received by the Administrative Agent, shall be applied, on the day of receipt, in the following order:
first
, to pay any fees and expense reimbursements and indemnification then due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent;
second
, to pay interest then due and payable on the Term Loans;
third

seventh
, to pay all other Obligations that are then outstanding and then due and payable. If all amounts set forth in clauses
first
through and including
seventh
above are paid, any excess amounts shall be deposited in a separate cash collateral account, and shall be released to the Lead Borrower on the day of receipt. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall release the funds held in the cash collateral account pursuant to clause
fifth
above to the Borrowers upon the Lead Borrower's request.
(b)       All credits against the Obligations shall be effective on the day of receipt thereof, and shall be conditioned upon final payment to the Administrative Agent of the items giving rise to such credits. If any item credited to the Loan Account is dishonored or returned unpaid for any reason, whether or not such return is rightful or timely, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to reverse such credit and charge the amount of such item to the Loan Account and the Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders against all claims and losses resulting from such dishonor or return.
 
33
(i)        impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any holding company of any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or
(ii)       impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or LIBO Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBO Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such LIBO Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) other than Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 2.18 hereof, then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)       If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Term Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)       A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined shall be delivered to the Lead Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof.
(d)       Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the relevant Change in Law shall constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation.

(a)       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, if (x) any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for a Lender to make or maintain a LIBO Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to a LIBO Loan or (y) at any time any Lender determines that the making or continuance of any of its LIBO Loans has become impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the date hereof which adversely affects the London interbank market or the position of such Lender in the London interbank market, then, by written notice to the Lead Borrower, such Lender may (i) declare that LIBO Loans will not thereafter be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by the Borrowers for a LIBO Loan shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for a Prime Rate Loan unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and (ii) require that all outstanding LIBO Loans made by it be converted to Prime Rate Loans, in which event all such LIBO Loans shall be automatically converted to Prime Rate Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below. In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (a), all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the LIBO Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted LIBO Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the Prime Rate Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such LIBO Loans.
(b)       For purposes of this Section 2.16, a notice to the Lead Borrower by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective, and if any LIBO Loans shall then be outstanding, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period; and otherwise such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Lead Borrower.
(a)       The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by them hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees, or of amounts payable under Sections 2.11(b), 2.15 or 2.18, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., New York time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 100 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.11(b), 2.15, 2.18 or 9.3 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document (other than payments with respect to LIBO Loans) shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, if any payment due with respect to LIBO Loans shall be due on a day
 
35
that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, unless that succeeding Business Day is in the next calendar month, in which event, the date of such payment shall be on the last Business Day of subject calendar month, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.
(b)       If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.14(a) or Section 7.4 hereof, as applicable.
(c)       If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its portion of the outstanding Term Loans resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its portion of the outstanding Term Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the portions of the outstanding Term Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective portions of the outstanding Term Loans,
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in its portion of the outstanding Term Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrowers or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrowers consent to the foregoing and agree, to the extent they may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrowers rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.
(d)       Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Lead Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
 
36
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
(e)       If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to this Agreement, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under this Agreement until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
(a)       Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrowers shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Agents or any Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrowers shall make such deductions, and (iii) the Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.
(b)       In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.
(c)       The Borrowers shall indemnify the Agents and each Lender within ten (10) Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender or by any Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount was determined, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)       As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such
 
37
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)       Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction in withholding tax shall deliver to the Lead Borrower and the Administrative Agent two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, or, in the case of a Foreign Lender's claiming exemption from or reduction in U.S. Federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Foreign Lender delivers a Form W-8BEN, a certificate representing that such Foreign Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrowers and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrowers (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Lender claiming complete exemption from or reduced rate of, United States federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming exemption for "portfolio interest" certifying that it is not a foreign corporation, partnership, estate or trust. Such forms shall be delivered by each Foreign Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a transferee that is a participation holder, on or before the date such participation holder becomes a transferee hereunder) and on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Lender changes its applicable lending office by designating a different lending office (a "New Lending Office"). In addition, each Foreign Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Lender. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.18(e), a Foreign Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this 2.18(e) that such Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver.
(f)        The Borrowers shall not be required to indemnify any Foreign Lender or to pay any additional amounts to any Foreign Lender in respect of United States federal withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) above to the extent that the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Foreign Lender to comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) above. Should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrowers shall, at such Lender's expense, take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.
2.19     
Security Interests in Collateral
. To secure the Obligations relating to the Term Loan A under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Borrowers shall grant to the Collateral Agent, for its benefit and the ratable benefit of the other Secured Parties, a security interest in all of the Collateral pursuant hereto and to the Security Documents, which security
 
38
interest shall be subject in priority only to the security interest granted to the Revolving Agent under the Revolving Loan Documents.
(a)       If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Term Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.15 or 2.18, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment; provided, however, that the Borrowers shall not be liable for such costs and expenses of a Lender requesting compensation if (i) such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement on a date after the Closing Date and (ii) the relevant Change in Law occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party hereto.
(b)       If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund the Term Loans hereunder, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.5), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),
provided
that (i) except in the case of an assignment to another Lender, the Borrowers shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Term Loans accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.18, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

If for any reason any Lender shall fail or refuse to abide by its obligations under this Agreement, including without limitation its obligation to make available to Administrative Agent its Term Loan A Commitment Percentage of the Term Loan A or its Term Loan B Commitment Percentage of the Term Loan B, as applicable, expenses or setoff (a "Delinquent Lender") and such failure is not cured within ten (10) days of receipt from the Administrative Agent of written notice thereof, then, in addition to the rights and remedies that may be available to Agents, other Lenders, the Borrowers or any other party at law or in equity, and not in limitation thereof, (i) such Delinquent Lender's right to participate in the administration of, or decision-making rights related to, the Term Loans, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be suspended during the pendency of such failure or refusal, and (ii) a Delinquent Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments due to it from the Borrowers, whether on account of outstanding Term Loans, interest, fees or otherwise, to the remaining non-delinquent Lenders for application to, and reduction of, their proportionate shares of all outstanding Term Loans until, as a result of application of such assigned payments the Lenders' respective Term Loan A Commitment Percentages of the outstanding portion of the Term Loan A or Term Loan B Commitment Percentages of the outstanding portion of the Term Loan B, as applicable, shall have returned to those in effect immediately prior to such delinquency and without giving effect to the nonpayment causing such delinquency. The Delinquent Lender's decision-making and participation rights and rights to payments as set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) hereinabove shall be restored only upon the payment by the Delinquent Lender of its Term Loan A Commitment Percentage or Term Loan B Commitment Percentage, as applicable, of any Term Loan, any participation obligation, or expenses as to which it is delinquent, together with interest thereon at the rate set forth in Section 2.5 hereof from the date when originally due until the date upon which any such amounts are actually paid.

(a)       No failure or delay by the Agents or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by a Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
(b)       Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Agents and the Borrowers that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders,

provided further
that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Agents without the prior written consent of the Agents.
(c)       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.2, in the event that the Borrowers request that this Agreement or any other Loan Document be modified, amended or waived in a manner which would require the consent of the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.2(b) and such amendment is approved by the Required Lenders, but not by the requisite percentage of the Lenders, the Borrowers, and the Required Lenders shall be permitted to amend this Agreement without the consent of the Lender or Lenders which did not agree to the modification or amendment requested by the Borrowers (such Lender or Lenders, collectively the "
Minority Lenders
") to provide for (x) the making of additional Term Loans by a new or increasing Lender or Lenders, as the case may be, as may be necessary to repay in full the outstanding Term Loans (including principal, interest, and fees) of the Minority Lenders immediately before giving effect to such amendment and (y) such other modifications to this Agreement or the Loan Documents as may be appropriate and incidental to the foregoing.
(d)       No notice to or demand on any Borrower shall entitle any Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. Each holder of a Term Note shall be bound by any amendment, modification, waiver or consent authorized as provided herein, whether or not a Term Note shall have been marked to indicate such amendment, modification, waiver or consent and any consent by a Lender, or any holder of a Term Note, shall bind any Person subsequently acquiring a Term Note, whether or not a Term Note is so marked. No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective against the Borrowers unless signed by the Borrowers.
(a)       Except as otherwise limited herein, the Borrowers shall jointly and severally pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents and their Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Agents, outside consultants for the Agents, appraisers, and for commercial finance examinations, in connection with the arrangement of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents or any Lender, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel and any outside consultants for the Agents or any Lender, for appraisers, commercial finance examinations, and environmental site
 
74
assessments, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Term Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Term Loans;
provided that
the Lenders who are not the Agents shall be entitled to reimbursement for no more than one counsel representing all such Lenders (absent a conflict of interest in which case the Lenders may engage and be reimbursed for additional counsel).
(b)       The Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify the Agents and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "
Indemnitee
") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Term Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated by any Borrower or any other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to Borrower or any other member of the Borrower Affiliated Group, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto,
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any Affiliate of such Indemnitee (or of any officer, director, employee, advisor or agent of such Indemnitee or any such Indemnitee's Affiliates). In connection with any indemnified claim hereunder, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to select its own counsel and the Borrowers shall promptly pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel.
(c)       To the extent that any Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Agents under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agents such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such unpaid amount,
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Agents.
(d)       To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, no party hereto shall assert, and each party hereby waives, any claim against any Borrower or Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to
 
75
direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, any Term Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.
(e)       All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
(a)       Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Lead Borrower as that Borrower's agent to obtain the Term Loans hereunder, the proceeds of which shall be available to each Borrower for those uses as those set forth herein. As the disclosed principal for its agent, each Borrower shall be obligated to the Agents and each Lender on account of the Term Loans so made hereunder as if made directly by the Lenders to that Borrower, notwithstanding the manner by which such Term Loans are recorded on the books and records of the Lead Borrower and of any Borrower.
(b)       Each Borrower recognizes that credit available to it hereunder is in excess of and on better terms than it otherwise could obtain on and for its own account and that one of the reasons therefor is its joining in the credit facility contemplated herein with all other Borrowers. Consequently, each Borrower hereby assumes, guarantees, and agrees to discharge all Obligations of all other Borrowers as if the Borrower so assuming and guarantying were each other Borrower.
(c)       The Lead Borrower shall act as a conduit for each Borrower (including itself, as a "Borrower") on whose behalf the Lead Borrower has requested a Term Loan. The Lead Borrower shall cause the transfer of the proceeds of each Term Loan to the (those) Borrower(s) on whose behalf such Term Loan was obtained. Neither the Agents nor any Lender shall have any obligation to see to the application of such proceeds.
(d)       Each of the Borrowers shall remain jointly and severally liable to the Agents and the Lenders for the payment and performance of all Obligations (which payment and performance shall continue to be secured, to the extent applicable, by all Collateral granted by each of the Borrowers).
(a)       The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any such attempted assignment or transfer without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other
 
76
than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agents and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b)       Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Term Loans at the time owing to it),
provided
that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, each of the Lead Borrower (but only if no Event of Default then exists) and the Agents must give their prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Term Loans, the amount of the Term Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless the Administrative Agent otherwise consents, (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.3). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.
(c)       The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in Boston, Massachusetts a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the principal amount of the Term Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "
Register
"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by
 
77
the Lead Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)       Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(e)       Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers or the Agents, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "
Participant
") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Term Loans owing to it),
provided
that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation in the Term Loans shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents,
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.2(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section and Section 2.20, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits (and subject to the obligations) of Sections 2.15, 2.17, and 2.18 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.9 as though it were a Lender,
provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender.
(f)        A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.18 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Lead Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.18 unless (i) the Lead Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 2.18(e) as though it were a Lender and (ii) such Participant is eligible for exemption from the withholding tax referred to therein, following compliance with Section 2.18(e).
 
78
(g)       Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest,
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
79
9.6       
Survival
. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrowers in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of the Term Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Agents or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Term Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.18, and 9.3 and Section 8 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Term Loans, or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
9.7       
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness
. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Agents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Article IV, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Agents and the Lenders and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
9.8       
Severability
. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
9.9       
Right of Setoff
. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, upon the prior consent of the Administrative Agent, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers against any of and all the obligations of the Borrowers now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured and regardless of the adequacy of the Collateral. The rights of each Lender under this
 
80
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender may have.
(a)       THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.
(b)       The Borrowers agree that any suit for the enforcement of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be brought in any court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or any federal court sitting therein as the Administrative Agent may elect in its sole discretion and consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. The Borrowers hereby waive any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit is brought in an inconvenient forum. The Borrowers agree that any action commenced by any Borrower asserting any claim or counterclaim arising under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be brought solely in a court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or any federal court sitting therein as the Administrative Agent may elect in its sole discretion and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any such action.
(c)       Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.1. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
9.11     
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL
. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Headings
. Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.
9.13     
Interest Rate Limitation
. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Term Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Term Loan under Applicable Law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Term Loan in accordance with Applicable Law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Term Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Term Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Term Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
(a)       The Obligations are joint and several obligations of each Borrower. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the obligations of Borrower hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any Agent or any other Lender or Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against any other Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise, (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other agreement, with respect to any other Borrower of the Obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the security held by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party.
(b)       The obligations of each Borrower hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Borrower hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Agent or any other Lender or Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Borrower or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Borrower as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations).
 
82
(c)       To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Borrower waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any other Borrower or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any other Borrower, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any other Borrower, or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any other Borrower, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Borrower hereunder except to the extent that all the Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Pursuant to Applicable Law, each Borrower waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to Applicable Law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Borrower against any other Borrower, as the case may be, or any security.
(d)       Upon payment by any Borrower of any Obligations, all rights of such Borrower against any other Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of any Borrower now or hereafter held by any other Borrower is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the Obligations. Until the Obligations are paid in full, none of the Borrowers will demand, sue for, or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Borrower on account of (a) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (b) any such indebtedness of any Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Collateral Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents. Subject to the foregoing, to the extent that any Borrower shall, under this Agreement as a joint and several obligor, repay any of the Obligations constituting the Term Loans made to another Borrower hereunder or other Obligations incurred directly and primarily by any other Borrower (an "
Accommodation Payment
"), then the Borrower making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to contribution and indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other Borrowers in an amount, for each of such other Borrowers, equal to a fraction of such Accommodation Payment, the numerator of which fraction is such other Borrower's Allocable Amount and the denominator of which is the sum of the Allocable Amounts of all of the Borrowers. As
 
83
of any date of determination, the "
Allocable Amount
" of each Borrower shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability for Accommodation Payments which could be asserted against such Borrower hereunder without (a) rendering such Borrower "insolvent" within the meaning of Section 101 (31) of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act ("
UFTA
") or Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act ("
UFCA
"), (b) leaving such Borrower with unreasonably small capital or assets, within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA, or (c) leaving such Borrower unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA.
9.15     
Patriot Act
. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "
Act
"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Borrower in accordance with the Act. Each Borrower is in compliance, in all material respects, with the Patriot Act. No part of the proceeds of the Term Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, for any payments to any governmental official or employee, political party, official of a political party, candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.

Confidentiality
. Each of the Lenders agrees that it will use its best efforts not to disclose without the prior consent of the Borrowers (other than to its employees, auditors, counsel or other professional advisors, to Affiliates or to another Lender if the Lender or such Lender's holding or parent company in its sole discretion determines that any such party should have access to such information, which party shall be informed of the confidential nature thereof) any information with respect to any Borrower which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement provided that any Lender may disclose any such information (a) as has become generally available to the public, (b) as may be required or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal, state or federal regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such Lender or to the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors, (c) as may be required or appropriate in response to any summons or subpoena or in connection with any litigation,
provided that
if the Lender is able to do so prior to complying with the summons or subpoena, such Lender shall provide the Borrowers with prompt notice of such requested disclosure so that the Borrowers may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy (nothing contained herein however shall result in such Lender's non-compliance with Applicable Law), (d) in order to comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such Lender, (e) in connection with the enforcement of remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (f) to any prospective transferee in connection with any contemplated transfer of any of the Term Loans or Term Notes or any interest therein

by such Lender provided that such prospective transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section. The Borrowers hereby agree that the failure of a Lender to comply with the provisions of this Section 9.16 shall not relieve the Borrowers of any of their obligations to such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the exercise of any right or remedy by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be subject to, and restricted by, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Except as specified herein, nothing contained in the Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed to modify any of the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, which, as among the Borrowers, the Agents, and the Lenders shall remain in full force and effect. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control.

UCC Financing Statements (including Fixture Filings, as applicable) or other appropriate filings, recordings or registrations containing a description of the Collateral have been filed in each governmental, municipal or other office as is necessary to publish notice of and protect the validity of and to establish a legal, valid and perfected security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Secured Parties) in respect of all Collateral in which the Security Interest may be perfected by filing, recording or registration in the United States (or any political subdivision thereof) and its territories and possessions, and no further or subsequent filing, refiling, recording, rerecording, registration or re-registration is necessary in any such jurisdiction, except as provided under Applicable Law with respect to the filing of continuation statements or as a result of any change in a Grantor's name or jurisdiction of incorporation or formation or under any other circumstances under which, pursuant to the UCC, filings previously made have become misleading or ineffective in whole or in part.
3.4       
Validity and Priority of Security Interest
. The Security Interest constitutes (a) a legal and valid security interest in all of the Collateral securing the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations, and (b) subject to the filings described in Section 3.3 above, a perfected security interest in all of the Collateral.

3.5       
Absence of Other Liens

3.6       
Bailees, Warehousemen, Etc.
Except as otherwise disclosed in the Perfection Certificate, no Inventory costing in excess of $3,000,000 held on a temporary basis of any Grantor is in the care or custody of any one third party or stored or entrusted with any one bailee or other third party and none shall hereafter be placed under such care, custody, storage or entrustment unless a waiver or other agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent is delivered to the Collateral Agent by such third party or bailee.

Each Grantor agrees not to effect or permit any change referred to in the preceding sentence unless all filings have been made under the UCC or otherwise that are required in order for the Collateral Agent to continue at all times following such change to have a valid, legal and perfected security interest in all of the Collateral.
(b)       Each Grantor agrees to maintain, at its own cost and expense, such complete and accurate records with respect to the Collateral owned by it as is consistent with its current practices and in accordance with such prudent and standard practices used in industries that are the same as, or similar to, those in which such Grantor is engaged, and, at such time or times as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, promptly to prepare and deliver to the Collateral Agent a duly certified schedule or schedules in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent showing the identity, amount and location of any and all Collateral.
4.3       
Protection of Security
. Each Grantor shall, at its own cost and expense, take any and all actions reasonably necessary to defend title to the Collateral against all Persons and to defend the Security Interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral and the priority thereof against any Lien not expressly permitted pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Loan Agreement.
4.4       
Further Assurances
. Each Grantor agrees, at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge, deliver and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents and take all such actions as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request to better assure, preserve, protect and perfect the Security Interest and the rights and remedies created hereby, including the payment of any fees and taxes required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the granting of the Security Interest and the filing of any Financing Statements (including Fixture Filings) or other documents in connection herewith or
 
-9-
therewith. If any amount payable under or in connection with any of the Collateral shall be or become evidenced by any promissory note or other instrument, such note or instrument shall be promptly pledged and delivered to the Collateral Agent, duly endorsed in a manner satisfactory to the Collateral Agent;
provided
that
, until such time as the Revolving Obligations have been paid in full, delivery of such Collateral shall be to the Revolving Agent, as agent for the Collateral Agent.
4.5       
Inspection and Verification
. Subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 5.9 of the Loan Agreement, the Collateral Agent and such Persons as the Collateral Agent may reasonably designate shall have the right, at the Grantors' own cost and expense, on reasonable prior notice except if an Event of Default then exists, to inspect the Collateral, all records related thereto (and to make extracts and copies from such records) and the premises upon which any of the Collateral is located, to discuss the Grantors' affairs with the officers of the Grantors and their independent accountants and to verify the validity, amount, quality, quantity, value, condition and status of, or any other matter relating to, the Collateral, including, in the case of Accounts or Collateral in the possession of any third Person, by contacting Account Debtors or the third Person possessing such Collateral for the purpose of making such a verification. The Collateral Agent shall have the absolute right to share any information it gains from such inspection or verification with any Secured Party.
4.6       
Taxes; Encumbrances
. At its option, the Collateral Agent may discharge past due taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and not permitted pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Loan Agreement, and may take any other action which the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or desirable to repair, maintain or preserve any of the Collateral to the extent any Grantor fails to do so as required by the Loan Agreement or this Agreement, and each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent on demand for any payment made or any expense incurred by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the foregoing authorization; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall not have any obligation to undertake any of the foregoing and shall have no liability on account of any action so undertaken except where there is a specific finding in a judicial proceeding (in which the Collateral Agent has had an opportunity to be heard), from which finding no further appeal is available, that the Collateral Agent had acted in actual bad faith or in a grossly negligent manner; and provided further that the making of any such payments by the Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default arising from the Grantor's failure to have made such payments. Nothing in this Section 4.6 shall be interpreted as excusing any Grantor from the performance of any covenants or other promises of any Grantor with respect to taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances and maintenance as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents.
(a)       If at any time any Grantor shall take a security interest in any property of an Account Debtor or any other Person to secure payment and performance of an Account, such Grantor shall promptly assign such security interest to the Collateral Agent. Such assignment need not be filed of public record unless necessary to continue the perfected status of the security
 
-10-
interest against creditors of, and transferees from, the Account Debtor or other Person granting the security interest.
(b)       To the extent that any Grantor is a beneficiary under any written letter of credit now or hereafter issued in favor of such Grantor, such Grantor shall deliver such letter of credit to the Collateral Agent,
provided
that

(a)       With respect to any Collateral consisting of Accounts, General Intangibles (including Payment Intangibles), Letter-of-Credit Rights, Instruments, Chattel Paper, Documents, and Investment Property, the Collateral Agent may collect the Collateral with or without the taking of possession of any of the Collateral.
(b)       With respect to any Collateral consisting of Accounts, the Collateral Agent may (i) demand, collect and receive any amounts relating thereto, as the Collateral Agent may determine; (ii) commence and prosecute any actions in any court for the purposes of collecting any such Accounts and enforcing any other rights in respect thereof; (iii) defend, settle or compromise any action brought and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Collateral Agent may reasonably deem appropriate; (iv) without limiting the Collateral Agent's rights set forth in Section 5.2 hereof, receive, open and dispose of mail addressed to any Grantor and endorse checks, notes, drafts, acceptances, money orders, bills of lading, warehouse receipts or other instruments or documents evidencing payment, shipment or storage of the goods giving rise to such Accounts or securing or relating to such Accounts, on behalf of and in the name of such Grantor; and (v) sell, assign, transfer, make any agreement in respect of, or otherwise deal with or exercise rights in respect of, any such Accounts or the goods or services which have given rise thereto, as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes.
(c)       With respect to any Collateral consisting of Investment Property, the Collateral Agent may (i) exercise all rights of any Grantor with respect thereto, including without limitation, the right to exercise all voting and corporate rights at any meeting of the shareholders of the Issuer of any Investment Property and to exercise any and all rights of conversion, exchange, subscription or any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to any Investment Property as if the Collateral Agent was the absolute owner thereof, including the right to exchange, at its discretion, any and all of any Investment Property upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other readjustment of the Issuer thereof, all without liability except to account for property actually received as provided in Section 5.3 hereof; (ii) transfer such Collateral at any time to itself, or to its nominee, and receive the income thereon and hold the same as Collateral hereunder or apply it to the Secured Obligations; and (iii) demand, sue for, collect or make any compromise or settlement it deems desirable. The Grantors recognize that (a) the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of all or a part of the Investment Property by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the
 
-18-
Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77, (as amended and in effect, the "
Securities Act
") or the Securities laws of various states (the "
Blue Sky Laws
"), but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire the Investment Property for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, (b) that private sales so made may be at prices and upon other terms less favorable to the seller than if the Investment Property were sold at public sales, (c) that neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party has any obligation to delay sale of any of the Investment Property for the period of time necessary to permit the Investment Property to be registered for public sale under the Securities Act or the Blue Sky Laws, and (d) that private sales made under the foregoing circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.
(d)       With respect to any Collateral consisting of Inventory, Goods, and Equipment, the Collateral Agent may conduct one or more going out of business sales, in the Collateral Agent's own right or by one or more agents and contractors. Such sale(s) may be conducted upon any premises owned, leased, or occupied by any Grantor. The Collateral Agent and any such agent or contractor, in conjunction with any such sale, may augment the Inventory with other goods (all of which other goods shall remain the sole property of the Collateral Agent or such agent or contractor). Any amounts realized from the sale of such goods which constitute augmentations to the Inventory (net of an allocable share of the costs and expenses incurred in their disposition) shall be the sole property of the Collateral Agent or such agent or contractor and neither any Grantor nor any Person claiming under or in right of any Grantor shall have any interest therein. Each purchaser at any such going out of business sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor.
(e)       With respect to any Collateral consisting of General Intangibles, the Collateral Agent may exercise all of the rights granted to the Collateral Agent under the IP Security Agreement.
(f)        With or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, the Collateral Agent may enter upon, occupy, and use any premises owned or occupied by each Grantor, and may exclude the Grantors from such premises or portion thereof as may have been so entered upon, occupied, or used by the Collateral Agent to the extent the Collateral Agent deems such exclusion reasonably necessary to preserve and protect the Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall not be required to remove any of the Collateral from any such premises upon the Collateral Agent's taking possession thereof, and may render any Collateral unusable to the Grantors. In no event shall the Collateral Agent be liable to any Grantor for use or occupancy by the Collateral Agent of any premises pursuant to this Section 6.1, nor for any charge (such as wages for the Grantors' employees and utilities) incurred in connection with the Collateral Agent's exercise of the Collateral Agent's Rights and Remedies (as defined herein) hereunder.
(g)       The Collateral Agent may require any Grantor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Collateral Agent at the Grantor's sole risk and expense at a
 
-19-
place or places which are reasonably convenient to both the Collateral Agent and such Grantor.
(h)       Each Grantor agrees that the Collateral Agent shall have the right, subject to Applicable Law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral, at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor.
(i)        Unless the Collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value, or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market (in which event the Collateral Agent shall provide the Grantors such notice as may be practicable under the circumstances), the Collateral Agent shall give the Grantors at least ten (10) days' prior written notice, by authenticated record, of the date, time and place of any proposed public sale, and of the date after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral may be made. Each Grantor agrees that such written notice shall satisfy all requirements for notice to that Grantor which are imposed under the UCC or other Applicable Law with respect to the exercise of the Collateral Agent's rights and remedies upon default. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale or other disposition of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.
(j)        Any public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale. At any sale or other disposition, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. If any of the Collateral is sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of by the Collateral Agent on credit, the Secured Obligations shall not be deemed to have been reduced as a result thereof unless and until payment is finally received thereon by the Collateral Agent.
(k)       At any public (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 6.1, the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor, the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Party from any Grantor on account of the Secured Obligations as a credit against the purchase price, and the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor.
 
-20-
(l)        For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof. The Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Secured Obligations paid in full.
(m)      As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the Collateral and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.
(n)       To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Grantor hereby waives all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
6.2       
Application of Proceeds

(b)       Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the Collateral Agent and the Grantor or Grantors with respect to whom such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.2 of the Loan Agreement.

The Grantors hereby waive any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit is brought in an inconvenient forum. The Grantors agree that any action commenced by any Grantor asserting any claim or counterclaim arising under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be brought solely in a court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or any federal court sitting therein as the Collateral Agent may elect in its sole discretion and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any such action.

SECTION 4
Grantors' Representations and Warranties

EXHIBIT A

If, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Agent, the Grantors have failed to take appropriate action within sixty (60) days after such notice is given to Collateral Agent, upon notice to the Grantors, the Collateral Agent may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, (but shall not be required to) take such action in the name of the Grantors, with any damages recovered in such action, net of costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred, to be applied as provided in Section 6.2 of the Security Agreement.
 
7
6.2       Any money damages awarded or received by the Grantors on account of such suit (or the threat of such suit) shall constitute IP Collateral.
6.3       Following the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent, by notice to the Grantors may terminate or limit the Grantors' rights under this Section 6.
SECTION 7

(a)       To supplement and amend from time to time Exhibits A and B of this Agreement to include any new or additional Intellectual Property of the Grantors.
 
8

6.1       Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Pledgors shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and/or other consensual rights and powers inuring to an owner of the Pledged Securities or any part thereof to the extent, and only to the extent, that such rights are exercised for any purpose consistent with, and not otherwise in violation of, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Loan Agreement, the other Loan Documents and Applicable Law;
provided
,
however
, that the Pledgors will not be entitled to exercise any such right if the result thereof could materially and adversely affect the rights inuring to a holder of the Pledged Securities or the rights and remedies of any of the Secured Parties under this Agreement, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or the ability of the Secured Parties to exercise the same.
 
5
6.2       Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Pledgors shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all cash dividends paid on the Pledged Collateral to the extent, and only to the extent, that such cash dividends are permitted by, and otherwise paid in accordance with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Loan Agreement, the other Loan Documents and Applicable Law. All noncash dividends, and all dividends paid or payable in cash or otherwise in connection with a partial or total liquidation or dissolution, return of capital, capital surplus or paid-in surplus, and all other distributions (other than dividends and distributions referred to in the preceding sentence) made on or in respect of the Pledged Collateral, whether paid or payable in cash or otherwise, whether resulting from a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the outstanding capital stock or partnership interests of the issuer of any Pledged Securities or received in exchange for Pledged Securities or any part thereof, or in redemption thereof, or as a result of any merger, amalgamation, arrangement, consolidation, acquisition or other exchange of assets to which such issuer may be a party or otherwise, shall be and become part of the Pledged Collateral, and, if received by the Pledgor, to the extent required to be paid to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents, shall not be commingled by the Pledgors with any of their other funds or property but shall be held separate and apart therefrom, shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and shall be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).
6.3       Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of the Pledgors to dividends that such Pledgor is authorized to receive pursuant to Section 6.2 above shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to receive and retain such dividends. All dividends received by any Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this Section 6.3 shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Pledgor in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.13 of the Loan Agreement in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).

6
SECTION 7
 
Remedies upon Default
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, it is agreed that the Collateral Agent shall have in any jurisdiction in which enforcement hereof is sought, in addition to all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or other Applicable Law. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent shall include, without limitation, the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times:
7.1       The Collateral Agent may sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Collateral, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor.
7.2       The Collateral Agent shall give the Pledgors at least ten (10) days' prior written notice, by authenticated record, of the Collateral Agent's intention to make any sale of the Pledged Collateral. Such notice, (i) in the case of a public sale, shall state the date, time and place for such sale, (ii) in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Pledged Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange, and (iii) in the case of a private sale, shall state the date after which any private sale or other disposition of the Pledged Collateral shall be made. The Pledgors agree that such written notice shall satisfy all requirements for notice to the Pledgors which are imposed under the UCC with respect to the exercise of the Collateral Agent's rights and remedies upon default. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of any Pledged Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale or other disposition of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.
7.3       Any public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale.
7.4       At any public (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 7, the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of the Pledgors, the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Party from the Pledgors on account of the Secured Obligations as a credit against the purchase price, and the Collateral Agent or such other Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to such Pledgor therefor.
 
7
7.5       For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Pledged Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof. The Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and the Pledgors shall not be entitled to the return of the Pledged Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Secured Obligations paid in full.
7.6       As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the Pledged Collateral and to sell the Pledged Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.
7.7       Each Pledgor recognizes that (i) the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of all or a part of the Pledged Collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77, (as amended and in effect, the "
Securities Act
") or the Securities laws of various states (the "
Blue Sky Laws
"), but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire the Pledged Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, (ii) that private sales so made may be at prices and upon other terms less favorable to the seller than if the Pledged Collateral were sold at public sales, (iii) that neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party has any obligation to delay sale of any of the Pledged Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the Pledged Collateral to be registered for public sale under the Securities Act or the Blue Sky Laws, and (iv) that private sales made under the foregoing circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.
7.8       To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Pledgor hereby waives all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal which such Pledgor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
SECTION 8
 
Application of Proceeds of Sale
The proceeds of any sale of Pledged Collateral pursuant to Section 7, as well as any Pledged Collateral consisting of cash, shall be applied by the Collateral Agent as required pursuant to the terms of Section 6.2 of the Security Agreement.
The Collateral Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Collateral by the Collateral Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the Collateral Agent or of the officer making the sale or other disposition shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Pledged Collateral so sold or otherwise disposed of and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of
 
8
the purchase money paid over to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
SECTION 9
 
Registration, Etc.
If the Collateral Agent reasonably determines that it is necessary to sell any of the Pledged Securities at a public sale, each Pledgor agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default hereunder, such Pledgor will, at any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Collateral Agent, use its best efforts to take or to cause the Issuer of such Pledged Securities to take such action and prepare, distribute and/or file such documents, as are required or advisable in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Collateral Agent to permit the public sale of such Pledged Securities. Without limiting any of its other indemnification obligations under the Loan Documents, each Pledgor agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Collateral Agent, each other Secured Party, any underwriter and their respective officers, directors, Affiliates and controlling Persons from and against all loss, liability, expenses, costs of counsel (including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel to the Collateral Agent), and claims (including the reasonable costs of investigation) that any of them may incur insofar as such loss, liability, expense or claim arises out of, or is based upon, any alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or in any notification or offering circular, or arises out of or is based upon any alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements in any thereof not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by any untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to such Pledgor or the Issuer of such Pledged Securities by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party expressly for use therein. Each Pledgor further agrees, upon such written request referred to above, to use its best efforts to qualify, file or register, or cause the Issuer of such Pledged Securities to qualify, file or register, any of the Pledged Securities under the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws or other securities laws of such states as may be requested by the Collateral Agent and keep effective, or cause to be kept effective, all such qualifications, filings or registrations. The Pledgors will bear all costs and expenses of carrying out their obligations under this Section 9. Each Pledgor acknowledges that there is no adequate remedy at law for failure by them to comply with the provisions of this Section 9 and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, and therefore agree that their agreements contained in this Section 9 may be specifically enforced.
SECTION 10
 
Further Assurances
Each Pledgor agrees to do such further acts and things, and to execute and deliver such additional conveyances, assignments, agreements and instruments, as the Collateral Agent may at any time reasonably request in connection with the administration and enforcement of this Agreement or with respect to the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof or in order better to assure and confirm unto the Collateral Agent its rights and remedies hereunder.
 
9
SECTION 11
 
Intent
This Agreement is being executed and delivered by the Pledgors for the purpose of confirming the grant of the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Pledged Collateral. It is intended that the security interest granted pursuant to this Agreement is granted as a supplement to, and not in limitation of, the Security Interest granted to the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, under the Security Agreement. All provisions of the Security Agreement shall apply to the Pledged Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall have the same rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions with respect to the security interests created in the Pledged Collateral as in all other Collateral. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Security Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control with respect to the Pledged Collateral and the Security Agreement with respect to all other Collateral.
SECTION 12
 
Governing Law
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF.
SECTION 13
Intercreditor Agreement
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the exercise of any right or remedy by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be subject to, and restricted by, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Except as specified herein, nothing contained in the Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed to modify any of the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, which, as among the Pledgors, the Agents, and the Lenders shall remain in full force and effect. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control.

Assigning Lender
") may assign to one or more special purpose funding vehicles (each, an "
SPV
") all or any portion of its funded Loans (without the corresponding Commitment), without the consent of any Person or the payment of a fee, by execution of a written assignment agreement in a form agreed to by such Assigning Lender and such SPV, and may grant any such SPV the option, in such SPV's sole discretion, to provide the Borrowers all or any part of any Loans that such Assigning Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement. Such SPVs shall have all the rights which a Lender making or holding such Loans would have under this Agreement, but no obligations. The
6
 
Assigning Lender shall remain liable for all its original obligations under this Agreement, including its Commitment (although the unused portion thereof shall be reduced by the principal amount of any Loans held by an SPV). Notwithstanding such assignment, the Agent and Borrower may deliver notices to the Assigning Lender (as agent for the SPV) and not separately to the SPV unless the Agent and Borrower are requested in writing by the SPV (or its agent) to deliver such notices separately to it. The Borrowers shall, at the request of any Assigning Lender, execute and deliver to such Person as such Assigning Lender may designate, a Note in the amount of such Assigning Lender's original Note to evidence the Loans of such Assigning Lender and related SPV.
