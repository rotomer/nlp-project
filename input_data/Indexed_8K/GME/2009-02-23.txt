Exhibit 99.1
GameStop Expects Continued Growth Despite Recession
EPS Growth of +18% to +22% Projected for 2009
Europe Forecasted to Contribute $2 Billion of Sales
GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2009--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today announced its fiscal 2009 sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal year ending January 30, 2010.
2008 Guidance Update
GameStop is narrowing its previously announced fourth quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share guidance to the high-end of the previous range. EPS is now expected to range from $1.33 to $1.34, a +17% to +18% increase over the prior year quarter. For the first time in the companys history, quarterly sales exceeded $3.0 billion. Total sales were $3.5 billion, a 22% increase over the prior year quarter, with comparable store sales increasing +9.6%.
Full year 2008 diluted earnings per share is now expected to range from $2.39 to $2.40, an increase of +33% over the prior year. Full year sales increased 24% to $8.8 billion, in comparison to $7.1 billion in fiscal 2007. Comparable store sales increased +12.3% for the full year.
Fiscal 2009 Guidance
Building on another record year in 2008, in which the company surpassed its original guidance, GameStop expects to outperform the retail sector again in fiscal 2009 despite the current global recession. The company projects 2009 growth as follows:
Total sales growth between +10.0% and +12.0%
Comparable store sales of +4.0% to +6.0%
Diluted earnings per share increasing +18% to +22%
Opening 400+ new stores worldwide
The guidance is based upon existing sales and margin trends, current estimates of new product launches, and the expectation that the recession will continue through the 2009 holiday season.
Final fiscal 2008 sales and earnings results and more detailed fiscal 2009 guidance will be released in mid-March.
Note that guidance does not include debt retirement costs or merger related expenses.
International Outlook
The completion of the Micromania acquisition has enabled GameStop to secure a major, growing foothold on the European continent, where sales are forecasted to reach $2 billion in 2009. Moreover, as each of the individual European markets approach scalability, productivity will continue to increase leading to increased operating earnings.
Balance Sheet
The balance sheet remains strong, due to GameStops ability to consistently generate significant positive cash flow year after year. In fact, the payment for the $628.5 million Micromania acquisition was completed with a combination of cash on hand and cash from operations by January 2009. As a result, the company is well positioned to continue US and international expansion while being open to any acquisition opportunities.
The video game business continues to enjoy robust growth, making it the fastest growing of the many consumer goods categories, said Dan DeMatteo, Chief Executive Officer of GameStop. 2008 marked yet another year of strong new hardware sales, which will again help drive sales of new video games in the years ahead. This trend continued in January as NPD reported US new hardware unit sales grew 29%, led by Nintendos Wii, DS and Microsofts Xbox 360.
Although our trade-in model is widely known as a driver of new software sales, our exceptional growth is also a function of thousands of conveniently located stores, excellent supply chain management, and the expertise of our associates who operate GameStop stores. Also of note is our US advertising penetration, and the power of our magazine, , which is the twelfth largest consumer magazine in America, with over 3 million subscribers. We are energized by the fact that video gaming has gone mainstream, with recent industry data showing that nearly half of new gamers are over 35 years old and 40% are female, concluded DeMatteo.
