GameStop Reports Record First Quarter 2009 Results
First Quarter EPS Exceeds High-End of Guidance
2009 Full Year EPS Guidance Reiterated
GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 21, 2009--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today reported record sales and earnings for the first quarter ended May 2, 2009.
Net earnings for the first quarter increased 13.4% to $70.4 million, including debt retirement costs of $2.9 million ($1.8 million, net of tax benefits), as compared to net earnings of $62.1 million in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share were $0.42, including debt retirement costs of $0.01 per diluted share, and exceeded the high-end of guidance, an increase of 13.5% compared to $0.37 in the prior year quarter.
Total sales for the first quarter increased 9.2% to $1.98 billion, as compared to $1.81 billion in the prior year period. Sales were led by a very successful launch of the Nintendo DSi handheld system and strong releases of Capcoms and however, sell through of these titles could not compare to the tremendous success of from Take Two Interactive and Nintendos in the prior year.
Resident Evil 5
Street Fighter IV;
Grand Theft Auto IV
Super Smash Bros. Brawl
First quarter comparable store sales were lower than expected, declining slightly by 1.5%, due primarily to sharper recessionary effects in Europe and a slowdown of new console sales that occurred late in the quarter.
During the quarter GameStop sustained its strong earnings growth momentum and exceeded earnings guidance despite less than planned comparable store sales, indicated Daniel DeMatteo, CEO of GameStop. Although new video game software sales declined by 2.8%, lower-priced used products grew a robust 31.9%, illustrating that value is becoming more important to our customers.
We continue to profitably manage our business through the global recession by effectively managing our buy-sell-trade model and maintaining tight expense control. In fact, we were able to retire $50 million of senior notes and end the quarter with cash of $230 million. I am also pleased that we were able to capitalize on the downward pressure of rents, and open 114 new stores. As in the past, we continue to improve operating margins, build brand and value awareness with consumers, and gain market share as we expand the video game market worldwide.
Updated Guidance
For the second quarter of fiscal 2009, GameStop is forecasting diluted earnings per share to range from $0.28 to $0.33 compared to $0.34 in the prior year period, when earnings grew 162% over the second quarter of 2007. Comparable store sales are projected to decline by 8% to 11%, due to an unfavorable comparison to the 20% increase in same store sales in the prior year quarter, declining new console unit sales, and the impact of government stimulus checks issued last year.
DeMatteo continued, In the second quarter, like the first, we face very strong comparisons to the prior year period due to the unprecedented number of blockbuster titles released in the first half of 2008 and a significantly more brittle global economy. We do expect the back half of this year to be stronger than the first half due to a full and wide-ranging new title lineup. All together, this places us in a prime position to capitalize on the growth in the market in the fall and holiday seasons.
GameStop is reiterating its full year diluted earnings per share guidance range of $2.83 to $2.93,representing a +18% to +22% increase over fiscal 2008. Full year comparable store sales are now expected to range from flat to +2%.
Note that guidance does not include debt retirement costs or merger related expenses.
