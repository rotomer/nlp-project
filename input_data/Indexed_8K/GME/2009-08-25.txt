Protective Covenants

Definitions
.
"Competing Business" means any Person whose principal business is video game specialty retail, movie and video game rentals, and/or consumer electronics retail, provided that in the case of consumer electronics retail, such Person has annual video game sales (including sales of video game hardware, software and accessories) for its most recently completed fiscal year of at least $1,000,000,000 in the United States or at least $500,000,000 outside of the United States.
(b)       
No Interference with Employee/Independent Contractor Relationships
.
Executive agrees that, through the latter of (i) the expiration (but not earlier termination) of the Initial Term (or the then current Renewal Term) or (ii) one year after Executive's employment with the Company ceases, Executive will not, either directly or indirectly, participate in recruiting or hiring away any employees or independent contractors of the Company, or encourage or induce any agents, employees, independent contractors, or investors of the Company to terminate their relationship with the Company, unless given the prior written consent of the Board to do so.
(c)       
No Interference with Client/Customer Relationships
.
Executive agrees that, through the latter of (i) the expiration (but not earlier termination) of the Initial Term (or the then current Renewal Term) of this Agreement or (ii) one year after Executive's employment with the Company ceases, Executive will not induce or attempt to induce any customer of the Company to diminish, curtail, divert, or cancel its business relationship with the Company. The restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall apply worldwide, which the Parties stipulate is a reasonable geographic area because of the scope of the Company's operations and Executive's activities.
(d)       
No Unfair Competition
.
Executive agrees that, through the latter of (i) the expiration (but not earlier termination) of the Initial Term (or the then current Renewal Term) or (ii) one year after Executive's employment with the Company ceases, Executive will not participate in, work for or assist a Competing Business in any capacity (as owner, employee, consultant, contractor, officer, director, lender, investor, agent, or otherwise), unless given the prior written consent of the Board to do so. The restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall apply worldwide, which the Parties stipulate is a reasonable geographic area because of the scope of the Company's operations and Executive's activities. This paragraph creates a narrowly-tailored advance approval requirement in order to avoid unfair competition and irreparable harm to the Company and is not intended to be a general restraint from engaging in a lawful profession or a general covenant against competition, and is ancillary to the Company's agreement contained herein to employ Executive for a definite term. Nothing herein will prohibit ownership of less than 5% of the publicly traded capital stock of a corporation so long as this is not a controlling interest, or ownership of mutual fund investments. Executive acknowledges and agrees that this subsection (d) is reasonable and necessary to protect the trade secrets, confidential information and goodwill of the Company.
 
8
(e)       
Remedies
.
In the event of breach or threatened breach by Executive of any provision of Section 10 hereof, the Company shall be entitled to (i) injunctive relief by temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, and/or permanent injunction, (ii) recovery of all attorneys' fees and costs the Company incurs in obtaining such relief, and (iii) any other legal and equitable relief to which the Company may be entitled, including, without limitation, all monetary damages that the Company may incur as a result of said breach or threatened breach, in each case without the necessity of posting any bond. The Company may pursue any remedy available, including, but not limited to, declaratory relief, concurrently or consecutively in any order as to any breach or threatened breach, and the pursuit of one such remedy at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other remedy.
(f)        
Early Resolution Conference
. This Agreement is understood to be clear and enforceable as written and is executed by both Parties on that basis. However, should Executive later challenge any provision as unclear, unenforceable, or inapplicable to any competitive activity in which Executive intends to engage, Executive will first notify the Company in writing and meet with a Company representative and a neutral mediator (if the Company elects to retain one at its expense) to discuss resolution of any disputes between the Parties. Executive will provide this notification at least 14 days before Executive engages in any activity on behalf of a Competing Business or engages in other activity that could foreseeably fall within a questioned restriction. The failure to comply with this requirement shall waive Executive's right to challenge the reasonable scope, clarity, applicability, or enforceability of the Agreement and its restrictions at a later time. If the Parties participate in early resolution conference on the terms described above, all rights of both Parties will be preserved, even if no agreement is reached in the conference.
11.
       
Merger or Acquisition Disposition and Assignment
.
In the event the Company should consolidate, or merge into another entity, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets, capital stock or operations to another Person, or divide its assets or operations among a number of entities, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with regard to the surviving or purchasing entity or entities and the Company may assign this Agreement if necessary to achieve this purpose.
