GameStop Reports Third Quarter 2009 Results
GameStop Expects to Grow 2009 Earnings in Spite of Industry Weakness
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is Biggest Launch in GameStop History
GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 19, 2009--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today reported sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2009.
Total company sales in the quarter were $1.83 billion, an 8.2% increase as compared to sales of $1.70 billion in the prior year quarter. New software sales grew 9.4%, advancing our new video game market share by 150 basis points over last year. Used product sales increased 19.4%, on top of the 19.3% increase in the third quarter of 2008. Comparable store sales decreased 7.8%, attributable primarily to a decline in new video game hardware sales.
The top five selling games during the quarter were Electronic Arts , Microsofts , Warner Home Video Games , 2K Sports and Nintendos . Each of these new games was well received by consumers and met or exceeded our initial sales expectations.
Madden NFL 10
Halo 3: ODST
Batman: Arkham Asylum
NBA 2K10
Wii Sports Resort
Net earnings for the quarter were $52.2 million, including $2.5 million of debt retirement costs ($1.6 million net of tax benefits). This represents an 11.8% increase as compared to net earnings of $46.7 million in the prior year period, including merger-related costs of $16.6 million ($10.5 million net of tax benefits). Diluted earnings per share were $0.31, including $0.01 of debt retirement cost, compared to $0.28 in the prior year quarter, including merger-related costs of $0.06 per diluted share.
Daniel DeMatteo, GameStop Chief Executive Officer, stated, A sharp focus on efficient operations in this challenging global economy delivered solid earnings results and significant market share gains. Gross margins expanded, led by a sequential 150 basis point improvement in the used category. Store foot traffic increased from the prior quarter, driven by strong new title releases and price cuts on all current generation platforms.
The holiday season has started strong. In the first 72 hours of its release, GameStop sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide of We are optimistic that the huge success of this game will serve as a bellwether for what we can expect for the remainder of our holiday game sales.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.
We know consumers are looking for value in these difficult economic times. Our stores are prepared to deliver this holiday with the broadest selection of new and used games, the most knowledgeable gaming associates and the buy-sell-trade model, which offers affordable choices that meet the needs of all types of gaming customers.

Based on strong initial results of the new software titles released earlier this month, such as 2 from Activision, from Nintendo and Ubisofts , we expect a solid fourth quarter in sales and earnings.

New Super Mario Bros.
