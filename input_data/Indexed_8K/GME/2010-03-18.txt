GameStop delivered its second highest earnings year ever in fiscal 2009, in spite of the weak worldwide economic environment, indicated Daniel DeMatteo, Chief Executive Officer. We saw global market share growth as new software sales increased 1.2%, proving once again that the great entertainment value and exceptional service GameStop delivers resonates with our customers. Each facet of our business has been evaluated in the past year and I am pleased that our team worldwide is working harder than ever to enhance our core competitive advantages and also build new, exciting growth drivers.
GameStop remains committed to our long-range plans by prudently investing in new stores and strategic initiatives to strengthen our relationship with our customers. In 2010, we see great opportunity to deliver earnings growth by improving global operational efficiencies, expanding our leading market share and utilizing the buy-sell-trade model to drive new and used software sales.
Business Outlook
For fiscal 2010, based on current market trends, GameStop expects the following:
Total sales growth between +4.0% and +6.0%
New hardware: -5.0% to -15.0%
New software: +2.0% to +5.0%
Used products: +5.0% to +10.0%
Other: +5.0% to +10.0%
Comparable store sales of 0.0% to +2.0%
Diluted earnings per share ranging from $2.58 to $2.68, an annual increase of +14% to +18%, based on expected outstanding diluted shares of 155,000,000.
During the year, GameStop intends to execute our previously announced capital allocation plan, which includes the following cash deployment:
$75 million in the opening of 400 new stores
$125 million in store improvements, information system support, refurbishment upgrades, distribution expansion and loyalty program enhancements
$100 million reserved for acquisition and investments
$300 million for share repurchases
Based on our current financial projections, the company forecasts it will end fiscal 2010 with $900 million cash on hand.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the company expects comparable store sales to range from -3.0% to 0.0%, driven by reduced hardware price points compared to last year. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.46 to $0.48, a 7% to 12% increase over the prior year quarter.
Note that guidance does not include debt retirement costs.
Share Buyback Update
