            On June 2, 2010 (the "Effective Date"), GameStop Corp. (the "Company") announced certain promotions in the offices held by its senior management.  The following executive officers were appointed to the following respective positions:
            In connection with the above appointments, on the Effective Date, the Company entered into amendments (each an "Amendment") to the Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreements (each an "Employment Agreement") of Messrs. Fontaine, DeMatteo, Raines and Bartel and entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with Mr. Lloyd (the "Lloyd Agreement").
 
            Each of the Amendments reflected the executive's new title.  In addition, the Amendment to Mr. Raine's Employment Agreement (i) extended the term through the third anniversary of the Effective Date, with automatic annual one-year renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least six months before annual renewal, (ii) increased his minimum base annual salary to $1,000,000, (iii) in addition to his target bonus of 100% of base salary previously established for the current fiscal year under the Company's Supplemental Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), established an additional target bonus of 100% of his annual base salary under the Plan, and (iv) extended certain restrictive covenants to a minimum of two years after his employment with the Company ceases.
 
            The Amendment to Mr. Bartel's Employment Agreement (i) extended the term through the third anniversary of the Effective Date, with automatic annual one-year renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least six months before annual renewal, and (ii) increased his minimum base annual salary to $750,000 and confirmed his target bonus for the current fiscal year under the Plan was previously established as 100% of his base salary.
 
            The Lloyd Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for a period of three years thereafter, with automatic one-year annual renewals thereafter unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least six months prior to annual renewal.  Mr. Lloyd's minimum base annual salary during the term of his employment under the Employment Agreement shall be no less than $500,000.  The Lloyd Agreement also provides for (i) annual bonus compensation for each year based on the formula and targets established under and in accordance with the Plan, (ii) in addition to his target bonus of 50% of base salary previously established for the current fiscal year, an additional target bonus of 50% of his annual base salary under the Plan, (iii) a grant on the Effective Date of 35,000 shares of restricted stock under the Company's Incentive Plan, vesting in equal annual increments over three years, and (iv) a cash bonus per
each such restricted share in an amount equal to the June 1, 2010 per share NYSE closing price, payable as and when such restricted share vests.
 
            The Lloyd Agreement includes a severance arrangement which provides Mr. Lloyd with his base salary and average bonus through the remaining term of the Employment Agreement, with a minimum of his base salary and average bonus for one year, if his employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined) or by him for Good Reason (as defined).
               
The above summaries of the Amendments and the Lloyd Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual Amendments and the Lloyd Agreement, copies of which are included as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.5 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

The Company may pursue any remedy available, including declaratory relief, concurrently or consecutively in any order as to any breach, violation, or threatened breach or violation, and the pursuit of one such remedy at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other remedy .
(g)
               
Early Resolution Conference
.  This Agreement is understood to be clear and enforceable as written and is executed by both parties on that basis. However, should Executive later challenge any provision as unclear, unenforceable or inapplicable to any competitive activity that Executive intends to engage in, Executive will first notify the Company in writing and meet with a Company representative and a neutral mediator (if the Company elects to retain one at its expense) to discuss resolution of any disputes between the parties. Executive will provide this notification at least fourteen (14) days before Executive engages in any activity on behalf of a Competing Business or engages in other activity that could foreseeably fall within a questioned restriction. The failure to comply with this requirement shall waive Executive's right
 
to challenge the reasonable scope, clarity, applicability, or enforceability of the Agreement and its restrictions at a later time. All rights of both parties will be preserved if the Early Resolution Conference requirement is complied with even if no agreement is reached in the conference.
