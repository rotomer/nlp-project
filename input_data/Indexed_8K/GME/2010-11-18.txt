Exhibit 99.1
GameStop Reports Third Quarter 2010 Results
Earnings Per Share of $0.38 Exceeds Street Estimates; Raising Full Year Guidance
New Software Sales Increase 9%
Digital Technologies Rolled Out for Holidays
GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 18, 2010--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest video game and entertainment software retailer, today reported record sales and earnings for the third fiscal quarter ended October 30, 2010.
Financial Results
Total sales for the third quarter increased 3.5% to $1.90 billion, in comparison to $1.83 billion in the prior year quarter. Continued significant market share gains on a strong slate of new title releases drove a 9% increase in new software sales.
U.S. segment comparable store sales were 5.3%, while total company comparable store sales increased 1.1%. New software sales were strong worldwide, but weakness in international hardware sales negatively affected the international comparable store sales. The shift in sales mix had a positive result on the companys gross margins and net earnings.
The top five selling games during the quarter were Microsofts from Electronic Arts, by Bethesda Softworks, from 2K Sports and from Electronic Arts.
Halo: Reach, Madden NFL 2011
Fallout: New Vegas
NBA 2K11
Medal of Honor
Net earnings for the third quarter increased 4.8% to $54.7 million, including $6.0 million of debt retirement costs ($3.8 million net of tax benefits), as compared to net earnings of $52.2 million, including $2.5 million of debt retirement costs ($1.6 million net of tax benefits), in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 16.1% to $0.36, including $0.02 of debt retirement costs, as compared to $0.31, including $0.01 of debt retirement costs, in the prior year quarter. Excluding debt retirement costs, GameStops diluted earnings per share were $0.38, achieving the high-end of company guidance.
During the quarter, the company repurchased and retired 2,611,993 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $18.91 per share under its current $300 million share repurchase program.
J. Paul Raines, Chief Executive Officer, stated, Our global retail team increased revenues, expanded gross margins and maintained tight expense control which led to solid earnings growth. Based on brisk sales trends of new software titles and motion controller launches, we are enthusiastic about our business and have raised our full year earnings guidance.
Dan DeMatteo, Executive Chairman, commented, Several technology and consumer initiatives have entered the market, each of them strengthening our core business and establishing GameStop as the retail leader in providing consumers with exciting ways to experience video gaming. The PowerUp Rewards Loyalty Program, Kongregate.com, in-store digital content sales and a re-tooled gamestop.com were all implemented to expand market share and increase our share of wallet. Lastly, the on-going execution of share buybacks and debt retirement reinforces our commitment to exercise disciplined capital allocation practices to maximize shareholder returns.
Year-to-date, GameStop has opened 156 net new stores: 89 in the U.S., 47 in Europe, 8 in Canada and 12 in Australia/New Zealand.
Updated Guidance
GameStop is raising its full year diluted earnings per share guidance range from $2.58 to $2.68 to $2.63 to $2.69, excluding debt retirement costs, representing a 16% to 19% increase over fiscal 2009. The company projects fourth quarter diluted earnings per share to range from $1.53 to $1.59, an increase of 19% to 23% over the prior year quarter.
The company expects comparable store sales for the fourth quarter to range from 2.0% to 4.0% and full year comparable store sales are still expected to range from flat to 2.0%.
