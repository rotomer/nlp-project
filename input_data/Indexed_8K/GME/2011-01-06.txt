Item 1.01         Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On January 4, 2011, GameStop Corp. (the "Company") entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company (the "Borrowers"), Bank of America, N.A. and the other lending institutions listed therein (the "Lenders"), Bank of America, N.A. as Issuing Bank, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, as Syndication Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association and Regions Bank, as Co-Documentation Agents (the "Agreement").
 
The Agreement amends and restates, in its entirety, the Company's prior Credit Agreement entered into on October 11, 2005, as thereafter amended from time to time, and provides for a five-year, $400 million asset-based revolver maturing on January 4, 2016.  The Company has the ability to increase the facility by $150 million under certain circumstances.
 
The Agreement places certain restrictions on the Company and its subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, loans, guarantees, acquisitions and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.  The per annum interest rate under the Agreement is variable and is calculated by applying a margin (1) for prime rate loans of 1.25% to 1.50% above the highest of (a) the prime rate of the administrative agent, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (c) the LIBO rate for a 30-day interest period as determined on such day plus 1.00%, and (2) for LIBO rate loans of 2.25% to 2.50% above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is determined quarterly as a function of the Company's average daily excess availability under the facility and is set at 1.25% for prime rate loans and 2.25% for LIBO rate loans until the first day of the fiscal quarter of the borrowers commencing on May 1, 2011.  In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% or 0.50%, depending on facility usage, for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Agreement.
 
Certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company guaranteed certain obligations of the Company and the Borrowers (the "Guaranty").
 
The Agreement is also secured by substantially all of the Company's and certain of its subsidiaries' assets, including (i) inventory, (ii) accounts receivable (including credit card receivables), (iii) general intangibles (including trade names, trademarks and other intellectual property), (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment, (v) bank and investment accounts, (vi) investment property (including a pledge of subsidiary stock), (vii) owned real estate, (viii) claims and causes of action relating to the foregoing accounts receivable, certain intellectual property and the capital stock and other equity interests of certain of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries, pursuant to (a)  the Amended and Restated Security Agreement, dated  as of January 4, 2011 (the "Security Agreement"), (b) the  Amended and Restated P atent and Trademark Security Agreement, dated as of  January 4, 2011 (the "Patent Agreement"), (c) the Mortgage, Security Agreement, and Assignment and Deeds of Trust between GameStop of Texas, L.P. and Bank of America, N.A., as Collateral Agent (the "GameStop Mortgage Agreement") and (d) the Mortgage, Security Agreement, and Assignment and Deeds of Trust between Electronics Boutique of America, Inc. and Bank of America, N.A., as Collateral Agent (the "EB Mortgage Agreement").  In addition, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into the Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement, dated as of January 4, 2011, pledging certain interests in certain subsidiaries (the "Pledge Agreement").
 
 
 
The Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any material representation or warranty made by  the Company or the Borrowers proving to be false in any material respect, certain bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership events affecting the Company or its subsidiaries, defaults relating to certain other indebtedness, imposition of certain judgments and mergers or the liquidation of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries.  In the event of a default by the Company or any of the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of Lenders shall, take either or both of the following actions, (a) declare all obligations under the Agreement immediately due and payable, and terminate the Lenders  commitments to make loans under the Agreement, and/or (b) enforce any and all rights of the Lenders or Administrative Agent under the Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency and receivership, the commitments of Lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of the Company will become immediately due and payable.

rata

.
(a)        The initial Inventory Reserves and Availability Reserves as of the Effective Date are the following:

(b)        The Administrative Agent may hereafter, on three (3) Business Days written notice to the Lead Borrower, establish additional Reserves or change any of the foregoing Reserves, in the exercise of the Permitted Discretion of the Administrative Agent (provided that no such prior notice shall be required if a Cash Dominion Event exists or for  (1) changes to any Reserves resulting solely by virtue of mathematical calculations of the amount of the Reserve in accordance with the methodology of calculation previously utilized (such as, but not limited to, Rent and Customer Credit Liabilities), or (2) changes to Reserves or establishment of additional Reserves if a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or it would be reasonably likely that a Material Adverse Effect to the Lenders would occur wer e such Reserve not changed or established prior to the expiration of such three (3) Business Day period);
provided, however
, that as long as no Event of Default then exists and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall not modify the methodology in which Reserves described in Section
2.2(a)
hereof are determined from time to time.
2.3      
Making of Loans
.
(a)        Except as set forth in Sections
2.16
and
2.24
, Loans (other than Swingline Loans) by the Lenders shall be either Prime Rate Loans or LIBO Loans as the Lead Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers may request subject to and in accordance with this Section
2.3
, provided that all Swingline Loans shall be only Prime Ra te Loans. All Loans made pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, be Loans of the same Type.  Each Lender may fulfill its Commitment with respect to any Loan by causing any lending office of such Lender to make such Loan; but any such use of a lending office shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of the applicable Note.  Each Lender shall, subject to its overall policy considerations, use reasonable efforts (but shall not be obligated) to select a lending office which will not result in the payment of increased costs by the Borrowers pursuant to Section
2.23
.  Subject to the other provisions of this Section
2.3
and the provisions of Section
2.24
, Borrowings of Loans of more than one Type may be incurred at the same time, but no more than seven (7) Borrowings of LIBO Loans may be outstanding at any time.
(b)        The Lead Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent three (3) Business Days prior telephonic notice (thereafter confirmed in writing) of each LIBO Borrowing and one (1) Business Days prior notice of each Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans. Any such notice, to be effective, must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. on the third Business Day in the case of LIBO Loans prior to, and on the first Business Day in the case of Prime Rate Loans prior to, the date on which such Borrowing
is to be made. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the amount of the proposed Borrowing (which shall be in an integral multiple of $100,000, but not less than $1,000,000 in the case of LIBO Loans) and the date thereof (which shall be a Business Day) and shall contain disbursement instructions.  Such notice shall specify whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans or LIBO Loans and, if LIBO Loans, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no election of Interest Period is specified in any such notice for a Borrowing of LIBO Loans, such notice shall be deemed a request for an Interest Period of one month.  If no election is made as to the Type of Loan, such notice shall be deemed a request for a Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of its proportionate share of such Borrowing, the date of such Borro wing, the Type of Borrowing being requested and the Interest Period or Interest Periods applicable thereto, as appropriate.  On the borrowing date specified in such notice, each Lender shall make its share of the Borrowing available at the office of the Administrative Agent at 100 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, no later than 12:00 noon, in immediately available funds.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Bor rowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to Prime Rate Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing.  Upon receipt of the funds made available by the Lenders to fund any Borrowing hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall disburse such funds in the manner specified in the notice of borrowing delivered by the Lead Borrower and shall use reasonable efforts to make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrowers no later than 3:00 p.m.
 
 
 
(c)        The Administrative Agent, without the request of the Lead Borrower, may advance any interest, fee, service charge, or other payment to which any Agent or their Affiliates or any Lender is entitled from any Borrower pursuant hereto or any other Loan Document and may charge the same to the Loan Account notwithstanding that an Overadvance may result thereby.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lead Borrower of any such advance or charge no later than one Business Day prior to the making thereof.  Such action on the part of the Administrative Agent shall not constitute
a waiver of the Administrative Agents rights and each Borrowers obligations under Section 2.4.  Any amount which is added to the principal balance of the Loan Account as provided in this Section
2.3(c)
shall bear interest at the interest rate then and thereafter applicable to Prime Rate Loans.
 
 
 
2.4      
Overadvances
. 
(a)        The Agents and the Lenders have no obligation to make any Loan or to provide any Letter of Credit if an Overadvance would result.
(b)        The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, make Permitted Overadvances without the consent of the Lenders and each Lender shall be bound thereby.  Any Permitted Overadvances may constitute Swingline Loans.  The making of any Permitted Overadvance is for the benefit of the Borrowers; such Permitted Overadvances constitute Revolving Loans and Obligations. The making of any such Permitted Overadvances on any one occasion shall not obligate the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make or permit any Permitted Overadvances on any other occasion or to permit such Permitted Overadvances to remain outstanding.
(c)        The making by the Administrative Agent of a Permitted Overadvance shall not modify or abrogate any of the provisions of Section 2.6(f) regarding the Lenders obligations to purchase participations with respect to L/C Disbursements or Section 2.7 regarding any Lenders reimbursement obligations with respect to Swingline Loans
2.5      
Swingline Loans
.
(a)        The Swingline Lender is authorized by the Lenders and shall, subject to the provisions of this Section, make Swingline Loans up to $25,000,000 in the aggregate outstanding at any time consisting only of Prime Rate Loans, upon a notice of Borrowing received by the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender (which notice, at the Swingline Lender's discretion, may be submitted prior to 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day on which such Swingline Loan is requested);
provided
that
the Swingline Lend er shall not be obligated to make any Swingline Loan in its reasonable discretion if any Lender at such time is a Deteriorating Lender, unless the Swingline Lender has entered into satisfactory arrangements with the Borrowers or such Lender to eliminate the Swingline Lenders risk of full reimbursement with respect to such Swingline Loan. Swingline Loans shall be subject to periodic settlement with the Lenders under Section
2.7
below.
(b)        Swingline Loans may be made only in the following circumstances: (A) for administrative convenience, the Swingline Lender shall, at the Lead Borrowers request, make Swingline Loans in reliance upon the Borrowers actual or deemed
representations under Section
4.2
, that the applicable conditions for borrowing are satisfied or (B) for Permitted Overadvances.  If the conditions for borrowing under Section
4.2
cannot be fulfilled, the Lead Borrower shall give immediate notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender (a Noncompliance Notice), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly provide each Lender with a copy of the Noncompliance Notice. If the conditions for borrowing under Section 
4.2
cannot be fulfilled, the Required Lenders may direct the Swingline Lender to, and the Swingline Lender thereupon shall, cease making Swingline Loans (other than Permitted Overadvances) until such conditions can be satisfied or are waived in accordance with Section 
9.2
. Unless the Required Lenders so direct the Swingline Lender, the Swingline Lender may, but is not obligated to, continue to make Swingline Loans beginning one Business Day after the Non-Compliance Notice is furnished to the Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Swingline Loans shall be made pursuant to this subsection (b) (other than Permitted Overadvances) if the aggregate outstanding amount of the Credit Extensions would exceed the  Loan Cap.
 
 
 
2.6      
Letters of Credit
.
(a)        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, the Lead Borrower on behalf of the Borrowers, may request the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time after the date hereof and prior to the Termination Date, to issue, and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, the Issuing Bank shall issue, for the account of the relevant Borrower, one or more Letters of Credit;
provided
that no Letter of Credit shall be issued if after giving effect to such issuance (i) the aggregate Letter of Credit Outstandings shall exceed $50,000,000, or (ii) the aggregate Credit Extensions would exceed the Loan Cap; and
provided
,
further
, that no Letter of Credit shall be issued if the Issuing Bank shall have received notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders that the conditions to such issuance have not been met; and
provided
further
that the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue any such Letter of Credit in its reasonable discretion if: (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitr ator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Applicable Law relating to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Effective Date and which the Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it, (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally, or (C) any Lender is a t such time a
Deteriorating Lender hereunder, unless the Issuing Bank has entered into satisfactory arrangements with the Borrowers or such Lender to eliminate the Issuing Banks risk of full reimbursement with respect to such Letter of Credit.  Any Issuing Bank (other than Bank of America) shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing on each Business Day of all Letters of Credit issued on the prior Business Day by such Issuing Bank,
provided
that (A) until the Administrative Agent advises any such Issuing Bank that the provisions of
Section 4.02
are not satisfied, or (B) the aggregate amount of the Letters of Credit iss ued in any such week exceeds such amount as shall be agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank shall be required to so notify the Administrative Agent in writing only once each week of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the immediately preceding week as well as the daily amounts outstanding for the prior week, such notice to be furnished on such day of the week as the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Bank may agree.
 
 
 
(b)        Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date,
provided
that each Letter of Credit may, upon the request of the Lead Borrower, include a provision whereby such Letter of Credit shall be renewed automatically for additional consecutive periods of twelve (12) months or less (but not beyond the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to t he Maturity Date) unless the Issuing Bank which issued such Letter of Credit notifies the beneficiary thereof at least thirty (30) days prior to the then-applicable expiration date that such Letter of Credit will not be renewed.
(c)        Drafts drawn under any Letter of Credit shall be reimbursed by the Borrowers in dollars on the same Business Day of any such payment thereof by the Issuing Bank by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such drawing (together with interest as provided in Section
2.6(e)
) not later than 12:00 noon on (i) the date that the Lead Borrower shall have received notice of such drawing, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., on such date, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Lead Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received after 10:00 a.m. on the day of dra wing,

2.3
or 2.5 that such payment be financed with a Revolving Loan consisting of a Prime Rate Loan, or a Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Prime Rate Loan or Swingline Loan. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the B orrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will
make payment thereunder (which payment shall not be made until two (2) Business Days after such notice from the Issuing Bank to the Borrower),
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrowers of their obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such payment.
 
 
 
(d)        If the Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement, then, unless the Borrowers shall reimburse the Issuing Bank in full on the date such payment is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such payment is made to but excluding the date that the Borrowers reimburse the Issuing Bank therefor, at the rate per annum then applicable to Prime Rate Loans, provided that if the Borrowers fail to reimburse the Issuing Bank when due pursuant to paragraph 
(c)
of this Section, then Section 
2. 10
shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph 
(f)
of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(e)        Immediately upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Bank (or the amendment of a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof), and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold to each Lender, and each such Lender shall be deemed unconditionally and irrevocably to have purchased from the Issuing Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such Lenders Commitment Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each drawing thereunder and the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect thereto. Upon any change in the Commitments pursuant to Section
2.15
, 2.29 and/or
9.5
, it is hereby agreed that with respect to all Letter of Credit Outstandings, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations hereby created to reflect the new Commitment Percentages of the assigning and assignee Lenders.   Any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Bank under or in connection with a Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, shall not create for the Issuing Bank any resulting liability to any Lender.
(f)         In the event that the Issuing Bank makes any L/C Disbursement and the Borrowers shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
2.6(c)
, the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each Lender of such failure, and each Lender shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank the amount of such Lenders Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in dollars and in same day funds. If the Issuing Bank so notifies the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent so notifies the Lenders prior to 11:00 a.m., on any Business Day, each such Lender shall make available to the Issuing Bank such Lenders Commitment Percentage of the amount of such payment on such Business Day in same
day funds (or if such notice is received by the Lenders after 11:00 a.m. on the day of receipt, payment shall be made on the immediately following Business Day).  If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made its Commitment Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the Issuing Bank, such Lender agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. Each Lender agrees to fund its Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed payment notwithstanding a failure to satisfy any applicable lending conditions or the provisions of Sections 2.3 or
2.6
, or the occurrence of the Termination Date. The failure of any Lender to make available to the Issuing Bank its Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall neither relieve any Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Issuing Bank its Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above, nor increase the obligation of such other Lender. Whenever any Lender has made payments to the Issuing Bank in respect of any reimbursement obligation for any Letter of Credit, such Lender shall be entitled to share ratably, based on its Commitment Percentage, in all payments and collections thereafter received on account of such reimbursement obligation.
 
 
 
(g)        Whenever any Borrower desires that the Issuing Bank issue a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Lead Borrower shall give to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent at least two (2) Business Days prior written (including telegraphic, telex, facsimile or cable communication) notice (or such shorter period as may be agreed upon in writing by the Issuing Bank and Borrower) specifying the date on which the proposed Letter of Credit is to be issued, amended, renewed or extended (which shall be a Business Day), the stated amount of the Letter of Credit so requested, the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof, and the provisions thereof. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the applicable Borrower shall also submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Banks standard form in connection with any request for the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of Credit.
(h)        The obligations of the Borrowers to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any L/C Disbursement shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit; (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which the Borrowers may have at any time against a beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or against the Issuing Bank or any of the Lenders, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect; (iv) payment by the Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers obligations hereunder; or (vi) the fact that any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or any of their Affiliates shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the precedin g sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank,
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) suffered by the Borrowers that are caused by the Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 
 
 
(i)         If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Lead Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrowers shall deposit in the Cash Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105% of the Letter of Credit Outstandings as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Each such deposit shall be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such Cash Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposit s, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Collateral Agent at the request of the Lead Borrower and at the
Borrowers risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such Cash Collateral Account shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for payments on account of drawings under Letters of Credit for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time or, if the Loans have matured or the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other Obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.
 
 
 
2.7      
Settlements Amongst Lenders
.
(a)        The Swingline Lender may, at any time, and shall, not less frequently than weekly, on behalf of the Borrowers (which hereby authorize the Swingline Lender to act in their behalf in that regard) request the Administrative Agent to cause the Lenders to make a Revolving Loan (which shall be a Prime Rate Loan) in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the outstanding amount of Swingline Loans made in accordance with Section
2.5
, which request may be made regardless of whether the conditions set forth in Section
4
have been satisfied. Upon such request, each Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of such Revolving Loan for the account of the Swingline Lender. If the Swingline Lender requires a Revolving Loan to be made by the Lenders and the request therefor is received prior to 12:00 Noon, on a Business Day, such transfers shall be made in immediately available funds no later than 3:00 p.m. that day; and, if the request therefor is received after 12:00 Noon, then no later than 3:00 p.m. on the next Business Day. The obligation of each Lender to transfer such funds is irrevocable, unconditional and without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have so made its transfer to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until th e date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
(b)        The amount of each Lenders Commitment Percentage of outstanding Revolving Loans shall be computed weekly (or more frequently in the Administrative Agents discretion) and shall be adjusted upward or downward based on all Revolving Loans and repayments of Revolving Loans  received by the Administrative Agent as of 3:00 p.m. on the first Business Day following the end of the period specified by the Administrative Agent (such date, the 
Settlement Date
).
(c)        The Administrative Agent shall deliver to each of the Lenders promptly after the Settlement Date a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Revolving Loans for the period and the amount of repayments received for the period. As reflected on the summary statement: each Lender shall transfer to the Administrative Agent (as
provided below), or the Administrative Agent shall transfer to each Lender, such amounts as are necessary to insure that, after giving effect to all such transfers, the amount of Revolving Loans made by each Lender shall be equal to such Lenders applicable Commitment Percentage of Revolving Loans outstanding as of such Settlement Date. If the summary statement requires transfers to be made to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders and is received prior to 12:00 Noon on a Business Day, such transfers shall be made in immediately available funds no later than 3:00 p.m. that day; and, if received after 12:00 Noon, then no later than 3:00 p.m. on the next Business Day. The obligation of each Lender to transfer such funds is irrevocable, unconditional and without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have so made its transfer to the Administrative Agent, such Len der agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

(b)        Each Lender is hereby authorized by the Borrower to endorse on a schedule attached to each Note delivered to such Lender (or on a continuation of such schedule attached to such Note and made a part thereof), or otherwise to record in such Lenders internal records, an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each Loan from such Lender, each payment and prepayment of principal of any such Loan, each payment of interest on any such Loan and the other information provided for on such schedule;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Lender to make such a notation or any error therein shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans made by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Notes.
(c)        Upon receipt of an affidavit of a Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such Lenders Note and an indemnity in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lead Borrower, and upon cancellation of such Note, the Borrowers will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement Note in favor of such Lender, in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor.

(b)        the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lead Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter (but in any event, within two (2) Business Days) and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Lead Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Borrowing Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a

subject to the following:
(i)         no Borrowing of Loans may be converted into, or continued as, LIBO Loans at any time when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(ii)        if less than a full Borrowing of Loans is converted, such conversion shall be made
pro
rata
among the Lenders, as applicable, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the Loans comprising such Borrowing held by such Lenders immediately prior to such conversion;
(iii)       the aggregate principal amount of Loans being converted into or continued as LIBO Loans shall be in an integral of $100,000 and at least $1,000,000;
(iv)       each Lender shall effect each conversion by applying the proceeds of its new LIBO Loan or Prime Rate Loan, as the case may be, to its Loan being so converted;
(v)        the Interest Period with respect to a Borrowing of LIBO Loans effected by a conversion or in respect to the Borrowing of LIBO Loans being continued as LIBO Loans shall commence on the date of conversion or the expiration of the current Interest Period applicable to such continued Borrowing, as the case may be;
 
 
 
(vi)       a Borrowing of LIBO Loans may be converted only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto;
(vii)      each request for a conversion or continuation of a Borrowing of LIBO Loans which fails to state an applicable Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one month; and
(viii)      no more than seven (7) Borrowings of LIBO Loans may be outstanding at any time.
If the Lead Borrower does not give notice to convert any Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans, or does not give notice to continue, or does not have the right to continue, any Borrowing as LIBO Loans, in each case as provided above, such Borrowing shall automatically be converted to, or continued as, as applicable, a Borrowing of Prime Rate Loans at the expiration of the then current Interest Period. The Administrative Agent shall, after it receives notice from the Borrower, promptly give each Lender notice of any conversion, in whole or part, of any Loan made by such Lender.
2.18    
Mandatory Prepayment; Cash Collateral; Commitment Termination

(b)        To the extent required pursuant to Section
2.21
, the Revolving Loans shall be repaid daily in accordance with the provisions of said Section

Breakage Costs (as defined below) associated therewith. In order to avoid such Breakage Costs, as long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the request of the Lead Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall hold all amounts required to be applied to LIBO Loans in the Cash Collateral Account and will apply such funds to the applicable LIBO Loans at the end of the then pending Interest Period therefor and such LIBO Loans shall continue to bear interest at the rate set forth in Section
2.9
until the amounts in the Cash Collateral Account have been so applied (provided that the foregoing shall in no way limit or restrict the Agents rights upon the subsequent occurrence of an Event of Default). No partial prepayment of a Borrow ing of LIBO Loans shall result in the aggregate principal amount of the LIBO Loans remaining outstanding pursuant to such Borrowing being less than $1,000,000 (unless all such outstanding LIBO Loans are being prepaid in full). Any prepayment of the Revolving Loans shall not permanently reduce the Commitments.
 
 
 
(e)        All amounts required to be applied to all Loans hereunder (other than Swingline Loans) shall be applied ratably in accordance with each Lenders Commitment Percentage.

(iii)       Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount and Type of the Loans to be prepaid and, in the case of LIBO Loans, the Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such Loans were made. Each notice of prepayment shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrowers to prepay such Loan by the amount and on the date stated therein. The Administrative Agent shall, promptly after receiving notice from the Lead Borrower hereunder, notify each Lender of the principal amount and Type of the Loans held by such Lender which are to be prepaid, the prepayment date and the manner of application of the prepayment.
(b)        The Borrowers shall reimburse each Lender on demand for any loss incurred or to be incurred by it in the reemployment of the funds released (i) resulting from any prepayment (for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, conversion to Prime Rate Loans or acceleration by virtue of, and after, the occurrence of an Event of Default) of any LIBO Loan required or permitted under this Agreement, if such Loan is prepaid other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan or (ii) in the event that after the Lead Borrower delivers a notice of borrowing under Section
2.3
in respect of LIBO Loans, such Loans are not b orrowed on the first day of the Interest Period specified in such notice of borrowing for any reason. Such loss shall be the amount as reasonably determined by such Lender as the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of interest which would have accrued to such Lender on the amount so paid or not borrowed at a rate of interest equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate  for such Loan, for the period from the date of such payment or failure to borrow to the last day (x) in the case of a payment or refinancing of a LIBO Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan, of the then current Interest Period for such Loan or (y) in the case of such failure to borrow, of the Interest Period for such LIBO Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure to borrow, over (B) the amount of interest which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the London interbank market (collectively,

Any Lender demanding such payment shall deliver to the Lead Borrower from time to time one or more certificates setting forth the amount of such loss as determined by such Lender and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount was determined.

2.23    
Increased Costs
.
(a)        If any Change in Law shall:
 
 
 
(i)         impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any holding company of any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or
(ii)        impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or LIBO Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBO Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) other than Taxes, which shall be governed by Section
2.26
hereof , then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)        If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders or the Issuing Bank& #8217;s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)        A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph 
(a)
or
(b)
of this Section and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined shall be delivered to the Lead Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof.
 
 
 
(d)        Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the relevant Change in Law shall constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation.
2.24    
Change in Legality
.
(a)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, if (x) any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for a Lender to make or maintain a LIBO Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to a LIBO Loan or (y) at any time any Lender determines that the making or continuance of any of its LIBO Loans has become impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the date hereof which adversely affects the London interbank market or the position of such Lender in the London interbank market, then, by written notice to the Lead Borrower, such Lender may (i) declare that LIBO Loans will not thereafter be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by the Borrowers for a LIBO Borrowing shall, as to such Lender only, be deem ed a request for a Prime Rate Loan unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and (ii) require that all outstanding LIBO Loans made by it be converted to Prime Rate Loans, in which event all such LIBO Loans shall be automatically converted to Prime Rate Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below. In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (a), all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the LIBO Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted LIBO Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the Prime Rate Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such LIBO Loans.
(b)        For purposes of this Section
2.24
, a notice to the Lead Borrower by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective, and if any LIBO Loans shall then be outstanding, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period; and otherwise such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Lead Borrower.
2.25    
Payments; Sharing of Setoff
.
(a)        The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of drawings under Letters of Credit, or of amounts payable under Sections
2.19(b)
,
2.23
or
2.26
, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date whe n due, in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its
offices at 100 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections
2.19(b)
,
2.23
,
2.26
or
9.3
shall be made directly to the Persons entitled ther eto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document (other than payments with respect to LIBO Borrowings) shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, if any payment due with respect to LIBO Borrowings shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, unless that succeeding Business Day is in the next calendar month, in which event, the date of such payment shall be on the last Business Day of subject calendar month, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dolla rs.
 
 
 
(b)        If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.22(a)
or 7.3 hereof, as applicable.
(c)        If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in drawings under Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in drawings under Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in drawings under Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the L enders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in drawings under Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans,
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in drawings under Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to the
Borrowers or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrowers consent to the foregoing and agree, to the extent they may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrowers rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation.
 
 
 
(d)        Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Lead Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for ea ch day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
2.26    
Taxes
.
(a)        Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrowers shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Agents, any Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrowers shall make such deductions, and (iii) the Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the releva nt Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.
(b)        In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.
(c)        The Borrowers shall indemnify the Agents, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within ten (10) Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by any Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount was determined, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
 
 
(d)        As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)        Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction in withholding tax shall deliver to the Lead Borrower and the Administrative Agent two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, or, in the case of a Foreign Lenders claiming exemption from or reduction in U.S. Federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of portfolio interest, a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Foreign Lender delivers a Form W-8BEN, a certificate representing that such Foreign Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meani ng of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrowers and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrowers (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Lender claiming complete exemption from or reduced rate of, United States federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming exemption for portfolio interest certifying that it is not a foreign corporation, partnership, estate or trust. Such forms shall be delivered by each Foreign Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a transferee that is a participation holder, on or before the date such participation holder becomes a transferee hereunder) and on or before the date, if any, such Foreign Lender changes its applicable lending office by designating a different lending office (a New Lending Office). In additio n, each Foreign Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Lender. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
2.26(e)
, a Foreign Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this
2.26(e)
that such Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver.
 
 
 
(f)         The Borrowers shall not be required to indemnify any Foreign Lender or to pay any additional amounts to any Foreign Lender in respect of United States federal withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) above to the extent that the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Foreign Lender to comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) above. Should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrowers shall, at such Lenders expense, take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.
(g)        If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Lead Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Lead Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Lead Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Lead Borrower or the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
2.27    
Security Interests in Collateral
.  To secure their Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Borrowers shall grant, and shall cause each Facility Guarantor to grant to the Collateral Agent, for its benefit and the ratable benefit of the other Credit Parties, a first-priority security interest or mortgage Lien in all of the Collateral pursuant hereto and to the Security Documents.
2.28    
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
.
(a)        If any Lender requests compensation under Section 
2.23
, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 
2.26
, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the r easonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Sections
2.23
or
2.26
, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment; provided, however,
that the Borrowers shall not be liable for such costs and expenses of a Lender requesting compensation if (i) such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement on a date after the Effective Date and (ii) the relevant Change in Law occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party hereto.
 
 
 
(b)        If any Lender requests compensation under Section 
2.23
, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 
2.26
, or if any Lender is a Deteriorating Lender or a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 
9.5
), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment or to an Eligible Assignee),
provided
that (i) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in t he case of all other amounts) and (ii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 
2.23
or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 
2.26
, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
2.29    
Increase in Commitments
.
(a)        Provided no Default then exists or would arise therefrom, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Lead Borrower may from time to time request an increase in the Total Commitments (each such increase, a 
Commitment Increase
) by an amount (for all such requests) not exceeding $150,000,000;
provided
that (i) any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $50,000,000, and (ii) the Lead Borrower may make a maximum of t hree such requests.  At the time of sending such notice, the Lead Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders).
(b)        Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Commitment Percentage of such requested increase. 
Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.
 
 
 
(c)        The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lead Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders responses to each request made hereunder.  To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), to the extent that the existing Lenders decline to increase their Commitments, or decline to increase their Commitments to the amount requested by the Lead Borrower, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Lead Borrower, will use its reasonable efforts to arrange for other Eligible Assignees to become a Lender hereunder and to issue commitments in an amount equal to the amount of the increase in the Total Commitments requested by the Lead Borrower and not accepted by the existing Len ders (and the Lead Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders) (such additional Lenders, 
Additional Commitment Lenders
),
provided, however,
that without the consent of the Administrative Agent, at no time shall the Commitment of any Additional Commitment Lender be less than $10,000,000.
(d)        If the Total Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Lead Borrower, shall determine the effective date (the 
Increase Effective Date
) and the final allocation of such Commitment Increase.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lead Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such Commitment Increase and the Increase Effective Date and on the Increase Effective Date (i) the Total Commitments under, and for all purposes of, this Agreement shall be increased by the aggregate amount of such Commitment Increase, and (ii)
Schedule 1.1
shall be deemed modified, without further action, to reflect the revised Commitments and Commitment Percentages of the Lenders.
(e)        As a condition precedent to any such Commitment Increase, (i) the Lead Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Borrower dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a responsible officer of such Borrower (A) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Borrower approving or consenting to such Commitment Increase, and (B) certifying that, before and after giving effect to such Commitment Increase, (1) the representations and warranties contained in Section 4 and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlie r date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.29, the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.4 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a), (b) and (c), respectively, of Section 5.1; (ii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, and any Additional
Commitment Lender shall have executed and delivered a joinder to the Loan Documents in such form as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably require; (iii) the Borrowers shall have paid such fees and other compensation to the Additional Commitment Lenders as the Lead Borrower and such Additional Commitment Lenders shall agree; (iv) the Borrowers shall have paid such arrangement fees to the Administrative Agent as the Lead Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree; (v) if requested by the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders an opinion or opinions, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, from counsel to the Borrowers reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and dated such date; (vi) the Borrowers and each Additional Commitment Lender shall have delivered such other instruments, documents and agreements as the Admin istrative Agent may reasonably have requested; and (vii) no Default exists.  The Borrowers shall prepay any Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.19(b)) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Loans ratable with any revised Commitment Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section 2.29.
 
 
 
(f)         This Section shall supersede any provisions in Sections 2.25 or 9.2 to the contrary.

negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any Affiliate of such Indemnitee (or of any officer, director, employee, advisor or agent of such Indemnitee or any such Indemnitees Affiliates).  In connection with any indemnified claim hereunder, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to select its own counsel and the Borrowers shall promptly pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel.

As the disclosed principal for its agent, each Borrower shall be obligated to the Agents and each Lender on account of Loans so made and Letters of Credit so issued hereunder as if made directly by the Lenders to that Borrower, notwithstanding the manner by which such Loans and Letters of Credit are recorded on the books and records of the Lead Borrower and of any Borrower.
(b)        Each Borrower recognizes that credit available to it hereunder is in excess of and on better terms than it otherwise could obtain on and for its own account and that one of the reasons therefor is its joining in the credit facility contemplated herein with all other Borrowers. Consequently, each Borrower hereby assumes, guarantees, and agrees to discharge all Obligations of all other Borrowers as if the Borrower so assuming and guarantying were each other Borrower.
 
 
 
(c)        The Lead Borrower shall act as a conduit for each Borrower (including itself, as a "Borrower") on whose behalf the Lead Borrower has requested a Loan. The Lead Borrower shall cause the transfer of the proceeds of each Loan to the (those) Borrower(s) on whose behalf such Loan was obtained. Neither the Agents nor any Lender shall have any obligation to see to the application of such proceeds.
(d)        Each of the Borrowers shall remain jointly and severally liable to the Agents and the Lenders for the payment and performance of all Obligations (which payment and performance shall continue to be secured by all Collateral granted by each of the Borrowers) notwithstanding any determination by the Administrative Agent to cease making Loans or causing Letters of Credit to be issued to or for the benefit of any Borrower.
(e)        The authority of the Lead Borrower to request Loans on behalf of, and to bind, the Borrowers, shall continue unless and until the Administrative Agent acts as provided in subparagraph (c), above, or the Administrative Agent actually receives
(i)         written notice of: (i) the termination of such authority, and (ii) the subsequent appointment of a successor Lead Borrower, which notice is signed by the respective Presidents of each Borrower (other than the President of the Lead Borrower being replaced) then eligible for borrowing under this Agreement; and
(ii)        written notice from such successive Lead Borrower (i) accepting such appointment; (ii) acknowledging that such removal and appointment has been effected by the respective Presidents of such Borrowers eligible for borrowing under this Agreement; and (iii) acknowledging that from and after the date of such appointment, the newly appointed Lead Borrower shall be bound by the terms hereof, and that as used herein, the term "Lead Borrower" shall mean and include the newly appointed Lead Borrower.

Successors and Assigns

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a part y hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 
9.3
). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph& nbsp;(e) of this Section.

Register
). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Lead Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(e)        Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers, the Agents, and the Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities, other than Borrower or Facility Guarantor or any member of the Borrower Affiliated Group (a 
Participant
), in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it),
provided
that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.

provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modificati on or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 
9.2(b)
that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section and Section
2.28
, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits (and subject to the obligations) of Sections
2.23
,
2.25
, and

9.9
as though it were a Lender,
provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 
2.25(c)
as though it were a Lender.
(f)         A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 
2.23
or
2.26
than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Lead Borrowers prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 
2.26
unless (i) the Lead Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 
2.26(e)
as though it were a Lender and (ii) such Participant is eligible for exemption from the withholding tax referred to therein, following compliance with Section

Such SPVs shall have all the rights which a Lender making or holding such Loans would have under this Agreement, but no obligations.  The Assigning Lender shall remain liable for all its original obligations under this Agreement, including its Commitment (although the unused portion thereof shall be reduced by the principal amount of any Loans held by an SPV).  Notwithstanding such assignment, the Agent and Borrower may deliver notices to the Assigning Lender (as agent for the SPV) and not separately to the SPV unless the Agent and Borrower are requested in writing by the SPV (or its agent) to deliver such notices separately to it.   The Borrowers shall, at the request of any Assigning Lender, execute and deliver to such Person as such Assigning Lender may designate, a Note in the amount of such Assigning Lender's original Note to e vidence the Loans of such Assigning Lender and related SPV.

Interest Rate Limitation
.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under Applicable Law (collectively the Charges), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with Applicable Law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and C harges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
9.14    
Additional Waivers
.
(a)        The Obligations are joint and several obligations of each Borrower.  To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the obligations of Borrower hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any Agent or any other Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against any other Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise, (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other agreement, with respect to any other Borrower of the Obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the security held by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Party.
(b)        The obligations of each Borrower hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of the Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Borrower hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Agent or any other Credit Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or
otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Borrower or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Borrower as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations).
 
 
 
(c)        To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Borrower waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any other Borrower or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any other Borrower, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. The Collateral Agent and the other Credit Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any other Borrower, or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any other Borrower, without affect ing or impairing in any way the liability of any Borrower hereunder except to the extent that all the Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Pursuant to Applicable Law, each Borrower waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to Applicable Law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Borrower against any other Borrower, as the case may be, or any security.
(d)        Each Borrower is obligated to repay the Obligations as joint and several obligors under this Agreement.  Upon payment by any Borrower of any Obligations, all rights of such Borrower against any other Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations and the termination of all Commitments to any Borrower under any Loan Document.    In addition, any indebtedness of any Borrower now or hereafter held by any Borrower is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the Obligations.  Until the Obligations are paid in full, none of the Borrowers will demand, sue for, or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness.  If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Borrower on account of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any such indebtedness of any Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Credit Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  To the extent that any Borrower shall, under this Agreement as a joint and several obligor, repay any of the Obligations constituting Revolving Loans made to another Borrower hereunder (an 
Accommodation Payment
), then the Borrower making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to contribution and indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other Borrowers in an amount equal to a fraction of such Accommodation Payment, the
numerator of which fraction is such other Borrowers Allocable Amount and the denominator of which is the sum of the Allocable Amounts of all of the Borrowers.  As of any date of determination, the 
Allocable Amount
 of each Borrower shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability for Accommodation Payments which could be asserted against such Borrower hereunder without (a) rendering such Borrower insolvent within the meaning of Section 101 (31) of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (
UFTA
) or Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Convey ance Act (
UFCA
), (b) leaving such Borrower with unreasonably small capital or assets, within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA, or (c) leaving such Borrower unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA.
 
 
 
9.15    
Patriot Act
.  Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "
Act
"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Borrower in accordance with the Act.  Each Borrower is in compliance, in all material respects, with the Patriot Act.  No part of the proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, for any payments to any governmental official or employee, political party, official of a political party, candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.
9.16

.
Neither of the advance of the Loans nor the use of the proceeds of any thereof will violate the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C.  1 et seq., as amended) (the "
Trading With the Enemy Act
") or any of the foreign assets control regulations of the United States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) (the "
Foreign Assets Control Regulations
") or any enabling legislation or executive order relating thereto (which for the avoidance of doubt shall include, but shall not be limited to (a) Executive Order 13224 of Septe mber 21, 2001 Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism (66 Fed. Reg. 49079 (2001)) (the "
Executive Order
") and (b) the Act.  Furthermore, none of the Borrowers or their Affiliates (a) is or will become a "blocked person" as described in the Executive Order, the Trading With the Enemy Act or the Foreign Assets Control Regulations or (b) engages or will engage in any dealings or transactions, or be otherwise associated, with any such "blocked person" or in any manner violative of any such order.
 
 
 
9.17    
Confidentiality
.  Each of the Lenders agrees that it will use its best efforts not to disclose without the prior consent of the Borrowers (other than to its employees, auditors, counsel or other professional advisors, to Affiliates or to another Lender if the Lender or such Lenders holding or parent company in its sole discretion determines that any such party should have access to such information, which party shall be informed of the confidential nature thereof) any information with respect to any Borrower which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement provided that any Lender may disclose any such information (a) as has become generally available to the public, (b) as may be required or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal, state or federal regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such Lender or to the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors, (c) as may be required or appropriate in response to any summons or subpoena or in connection with any litigation,
provided that
if the Lender is able to do so prior to complying with the summons or subpoena, such Lender shall provide the Borrowers with prompt notice of such requested disclosure so that the Borrowers may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy (nothing contained herein however shall result in such Lenders non-compliance with Applicable Law), (d) in order to comply with any law, o rder, regulation or ruling applicable to such Lender, (e) in connection with the enforcement of remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (f) to any prospective transferee in connection with any contemplated transfer of any of the Loans or Notes or any interest therein by such Lender provided that such prospective transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section. The Borrowers hereby agree that the failure of a Lender to comply with the provisions of this Section
9.17
shall not relieve the Borrowers of any of their obligations to such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Borrower consents to the publication by Administrative Agent of advertising material relating to the financing transactions contemplated by this Agreement using any Borrowers or Facility Guarantors name, product photographs, logo or trademark.

Exhibit C
Form of Opinion of Counsel
January 4, 2011
Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent for the Secured Parties, and the other Lenders party to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement referred to below
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     
We have acted as special counsel to GameStop Corp., a Delaware corporation ("
GameStop
"), GameStop, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("
GSI
"), Sunrise Publications, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("
Sunrise
"), Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation ("
EB Holdings
"), ELBO Inc., a Delaware corporat ion ("
ELBO
"), EB International Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
EB International
"), Kongregate, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
Kongregate
"), GameStop Texas Ltd., a Delaware corporation ("
GS Texas
"), Marketing Control Services, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("
MCS
") and SO COM LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
SOCOM
", and together with GameStop, GSI, Sunrise, EB Holdings, ELBO, EB International, Kongregate, GS Texas and MCS, the "
Borrowers
") in connection with that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of January 4, 2011, by, among others, the Borrowers, the Lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Issuing Bank (the "
Amended Credit Agreement
"). This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to
Section 4.1(b)
of the Amended Credit Agreement. References herein to the "
NYUCC
" and the "
DEUCC
" shall refer to the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the States of New York and Delaware, respectively. The NYUCC and the DEUCC are hereinafter referred to together as the "
UCC
". Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the same meanings as in the Amended Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein or in the Amended Credit Agreement, terms used in this opinion letter which are d efined in the NYUCC shall have the meanings provided therein.
In connection herewith, we have examined:
- 2 -
to each of the Officer's Certificates (the "
Reviewed Documents
");
(13) the form of Uniform Commercial Code financing statement attached hereto as
Exhibit B
naming Kongregate, as debtor and the Agent, as secured party, to be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (the "
Financing Statement
"); and
(14) certificates and statements of officers of each of the Borrowers, representations and warranties of the Borrowers in the Loan Documents and certificates and statements of public officials with respect to certain factual matters.
     
The documents referenced as items (1) through (6) above are collectively referred to herein as the "
Transaction Documents
."
     
We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such other corporate or analogous records, agreements and instruments of the Borrowers, certificates of public officials and officers of Borrowers, and such other documents, records and instruments, and we have made such legal and factual inquiries, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for us to render the opinions hereinafter expressed. In our examination of the Transaction Documents and the foregoing, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of the Borrowers to the Transaction Documents), the legal competence and capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied without independent investigation as to matters of fact upon statements of governmental officials and upon representations and warranties made in or pursuant to the Transaction Documents and the Loan Documents and certificates and statements of appropriate representatives of the Borrowers.
     
In connection herewith, we have assumed that, other than with respect to the Borrowers, all of the Transaction Documents have been duly authorized by, have been duly executed and delivered by, and constitute the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of, all of the parties to such Transaction Documents, all of the signatories to such Transaction Documents have been duly authorized and all such parties are duly organized and validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and perform such Transaction Documents.
     
We have assumed, with your permission, that (a) each of GSI and Sunrise (collectively, the "
MN Borrowers
", and each a "
MN Borrower
") was duly incorporated and remains validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota, (b) the execution and delivery by each of the MN Borrowers of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the performance by such MN Borrower of its obligations thereunder are within its corporate power and has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its part, (c) each of the Transaction Documents to which
- 3 -
each MN Borrower is a party has been duly executed and delivered by such MN Borrower and (d) the execution and delivery by each MN Borrower of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the performance by such MN Borrower of its obligations thereunder does not result in any violation by such MN Borrower of the provisions of its Organizational Documents.
     
Based upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the assumptions, comments, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
     
1. Based solely on the good standing certificates listed on
Schedule II
, (a) each of GameStop, EB Holdings, ELBO, EB International, Kongregate and GS Texas is validly existing as a corporation, in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (b) SOCOM is validly existing as a limited liability company in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and (c) MCS is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
     
2. Based solely on the good standing certificates listed on
Schedule II
hereto, each of the Borrowers is duly qualified or admitted to transact business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as applicable, in the applicable jurisdictions set forth on
Schedule II
hereto.
     
3. The execution and delivery by each Non-MN Borrower of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the performance by each Non-MN Borrower of its obligations thereunder are within its corporate or limited liability company, as applicable, power and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company, as applicable, action on the part of such Non-MN Borrower.
     
4. Each of the Transaction Documents has been duly executed and delivered by each Non-MN Borrower party thereto. Each of the Transaction Documents (other than the Notes) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each of the Borrowers to the extent that it is a party thereto, enforceable against each of the Borrowers to the extent that it is a party thereto in accordance with its terms, and each Note, when executed and delivered for value received, will constitute the valid and binding obligation of the Borrowers thereunder, enforceable against such Borrowers in accordance with its terms.
     
5. No consent, approval, authorization or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any federal, New York or Virginia governmental authority or regulatory body, that we, based on our experience, recognize as applicable to each Borrower in a transaction of this type, is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by each of the Borrowers of its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, except for such consents, approvals, filings or registrations that have been obtained or made on or prior to the date hereof and are in full force and effect.
6. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.6
to the Amended Credit Agreement, we

hereby confirm to you that, to our knowledge, there are no actions, suits, proceedings, claims or disputes pending or overtly threatened by written communication to any Borrower, before any federal, New York or Virginia Governmental Authority, that calls into question the validity of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the legal ability of any Borrower to perform any of its obligations under the Transaction Documents or the Loan Documents to which it is a party.
     
7. The execution and delivery by each Non-MN Borrower of the Transaction Documents and the performance by each Non-MN Borrower of its obligations thereunder do not result in any violation by such Non-MN Borrower of the provisions of its Organizational Documents.
     
8. The execution and delivery by each Borrower of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the performance by each Borrower of its obligations thereunder do not result in (a) any violation by such Borrower of (i) any provision of federal, New York or Virginia law that we, based on our experience, recognize as applicable to such Borrower in a transaction of this type or (ii) to our knowledge, any order, writ, judgment or decree of any federal, New York or Virginia court or governmental authority or regulatory body having jurisdiction over such Borrower or any of its material properties that names or is specifically directed to such Borrower, or (b) a breach or default or require the creation or imposition of any security interest or lien upon such Borrower's properties pursuant to any Reviewed Document, other than the security interests created by the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement and any rights of set-off or other liens in favor of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders arising under any of the Transaction Documents or applicable law.
     
9. If used solely for the purposes contemplated by
Section 5.13
of the Amended Credit Agreement and in compliance with
Section 3.19
of the Amended Credit Agreement and assuming that the value of any "margin stock," including stock that is repurchased by GameStop but is not retired, held by any Borrower does not exceed 25% of the assets of such Borrower and does not exceed 25% of the consolidated assets of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries, no part of the proceeds of any Loan or any Letter of Credit will be used, directly or indirectly, for a purpose which violates Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governor s of the Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R. Sections 220, 221 and 224, respectively.
     
10. The Security Agreement is in a form sufficient to create in favor of the Lenders (the "
Secured Party
") to secure the Secured Obligations (as defined therein), a valid security interest in all right, title and interest of Kongregate in and to the Collateral (as defined therein), to the extent that a security interest can be created by the execution and delivery of a security agreement under the NYUCC. Assuming (a) Kongregate has rights in such Collateral and (b) the Secured Party has given value within the meaning of Section 9-203(b)(1) of the NYUCC, upon the filing of the Financing Statement with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, as applicable, and the payment of all
- 5 -
applicable fees, such security interest will constitute a perfected security interest in all right, title and interest of Kongregate in and to such Collateral to the extent perfection of a security interest in the Collateral may be perfected by the filing of a financing statement under Article 9 of the DEUCC.
     
In addition to the assumptions, comments, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth above, the opinions set forth herein are further limited by, subject to and based upon the following assumptions, comments, qualifications, limitations and exceptions:
     
(a) Wherever this opinion letter refers to matters "known to us," or to our "knowledge," or words of similar import, such reference means that, during the course of our representation of the Borrowers, we have requested information from each Borrower concerning the matter referred to and no information has come to the attention of (either as a result of such request for information or otherwise) the attorneys of our Firm currently devoting substantive attention or a material amount of time thereto, which has given us actual knowledge of the existence (or absence) of facts to the contrary. Except as otherwise stated herein, we have undertaken no independent investigation or verification of such matters, and no inference should be drawn to the contrary from the fact of our representation of each Borrower. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to our opinions in paragra phs 6 and 8 above, we have not conducted a search of the dockets of any court or administrative or other regulatory agency or of any computer or electronic database.
     
(b) Our opinions herein reflect only the application of (i) applicable laws of the State of New York (excluding (A) all laws, rules and regulations of cities, counties and other political subdivisions of such State and (B) the securities, blue sky, environmental, employee benefit, pension, antitrust and tax laws of such State, as to which we express no opinion), (ii) the federal laws of the United States (excluding the federal securities, environmental, employee benefit, pension, tax and antitrust laws, as to which we express no opinion), (iii) to the extent required by the foregoing opinions, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, 101-1916 (2010)) (excluding any and all rules and regulations issued thereunder and executive and judicial interpretations thereof) and the Delaware General Corporation Law (Del. Code Ann. Tit. 8, 101-619 (2010)) ( excluding any and all rules and regulations issued thereunder and executive and judicial interpretations thereof), and (iv) solely with respect to the opinions set forth in clause (c) of paragraph 1, paragraph 3, paragraph 5, paragraph 6, paragraph 7 and clause (a)(i) of paragraph 8, applicable laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia (excluding (A) all laws, rules and regulations of cities, counties and other political subdivisions of such Commonwealth and (B) the securities, blue sky, environmental, employee benefit, pension, antitrust and tax laws of such Commonwealth, as to which we express no opinion). We note to you that the
- 6 -
attorneys who prepared and delivered this opinion letter are not licensed in the State of Delaware. The opinions set forth herein are made as of the date hereof and are subject to, and may be limited by, future changes in the factual matters set forth herein, and we undertake no duty to advise you of the same. The opinions expressed herein are based upon the law in effect (and published or otherwise generally available) on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or supplement these opinions should such law be changed by legislative action, judicial decision or otherwise. In rendering our opinions, we have not considered, and hereby disclaim any opinion as to, the application or impact of any laws, cases, decisions, rules or regulations of any other jurisdiction, court or administrative agency. We note that, with respect to the laws of the State of Minnesota, you have obtained the opinion of Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly LLP, special counsel to the MN Borrowers in such jurisdiction.
     
(c) Our opinions contained herein may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium or similar laws affecting or relating to the rights and remedies of creditors generally including, without limitation, laws relating to fraudulent transfers or conveyances, preferences and equitable subordination, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and (iv) the qualification that certain other provisions of the Transaction Documents may be further limited or rendered unenforceable by applicable law, but the inclusion of such provisions does not affect the validity as against each Borrower of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party as a whole or, subject to the other assumptions, comments, qualifications, limitations and exception s stated herein, make the remedies afforded to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders by the Transaction Documents legally inadequate for the practical realization of the principal benefits and/or security purported to be provided thereby.
     
(d) Our opinions are further subject to the effect of generally applicable rules of law arising from statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and the rules and regulations of governmental authorities that: (i) limit or affect the enforcement of provisions of a contract that purport to require waiver of the obligations of good faith, fair dealing, diligence and reasonableness; (ii) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected; (iii) limit the enforceability of provisions releasing, exculpating, or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct; (iv) may, where less than all of the contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the co ntract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange and (v) govern and afford judicial discretion regarding the determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys' fees.
- 7 -
Transaction Documents purporting or attempting to (A) confer exclusive jurisdiction and/or venue upon certain courts or otherwise waive the defenses of forum non conveniens or improper venue, (B) confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court not having independent grounds therefor, (C) modify or waive the requirements for effective service of process for any action that may be brought, (D) waive the right of the Borrowers or any other person to a trial by jury, (E) provide that remedies are cumulative or that decisions by a party are conclusive or (F) modify or waive the rights to notice, legal defenses, statutes of limitations or other benefits that cannot be waived under applicable law or (2) choice of law or any provision of any Transaction Document relating thereto;
     
(ii) the enforceability of (A) any rights to indemnification or contribution provided for in the Transaction Documents which are violative of public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation) or the legality of such rights, (B) rights of set-off, (C) any provisions purporting to provide to the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, the Secured Parties or Lenders the right to receive costs and expenses beyond those reasonably incurred by it or (D) provisions in the Transaction Documents whose terms are left open for later resolution by the parties;
     
(iii) the enforceability of provisions in any Transaction Document to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing;

(vi) the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision in any of the Transaction Documents which purports (A) to permit the Lenders to sell or otherwise dispose of any collateral subject thereto, or enforce any other remedy thereunder (including, without limitation, any self-help or taking possession remedy), except in compliance with the UCC, applicable Federal laws of the United States, and other applicable state and local laws, (B) to impose on any person or entity standards of care for collateral in such person's or such entity's possession or control other than as provided in Section 9-207 of the UCC, (C) to
- 8 -
provide for a security interest in the proceeds of any collateral subject thereto, nor do we express any opinion as to perfection thereof, except as provided by UCC Section 9-315, (D) to entitle the Lenders, as a matter of right, to the appointment of a receiver after the occurrence of a default or (E) to limit the ability of any Borrower or any other person or entity to transfer voluntarily or involuntarily (by way of sale, creation of a security interest, attachment, levy, garnishment or other judicial process) its right, title or interest in or to any collateral subject thereto, except as provided by UCC Sections 8-204 and 9-406, 9-407 and 9-408;
provided
that such limitations on the enforceability of any such provisions do not, in our opinion, subject to the other assumptions , comments, qualifications, limitations and exceptions stated herein, make the remedies afforded to the Lenders by the Transaction Documents legally inadequate for the practical realization of the principal benefits and/or security purported to be provided thereby;
     
(vii) the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any purported waiver under any of the Transaction Documents, or any purported consent thereunder, relating to the rights of the Borrowers or any other person or entity (including, without limitation, the marshalling of assets, reinstatement and rights of redemption, if any), or duties owing to it, existing as a matter of law (including, without limitation, any waiver of any provision of the UCC) except to the extent the Borrowers or such other person or entity may so waive or consent and has effectively so waived or consented (whether in any of the Transaction Documents or otherwise) in accordance with UCC Section 9-602 or other applicable laws, rules or regulations;
provided
that such limitatio ns on the enforceability of any such provisions do not, in our opinion, subject to the other assumptions, comments, qualifications, limitations and exceptions stated herein, make the remedies afforded to the Lenders by the Transaction Documents legally inadequate for the practical realization of the principal benefits and/or security purported to be provided thereby;
     
(viii) the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the security interests under any of the Transaction Documents in any item of the collateral subject to any restriction on or prohibition against transfer contained in any security, instrument or document evidencing or relating to such item except to the extent provided in UCC Section 9-406;
     
(ix) the existence or sufficiency of the Borrowers' rights in or title to any of the collateral; the creation, attachment or perfection of any security interest in any part of the collateral other than as expressly set forth in paragraph 10; or the priority of the security interests referred to therein against any financing statement (including the Financing Statement), security interest, mortgage, lien or other encumbrance on or covering any collateral subject to any of the Loan Documents in favor of any other person or entity;
- 9 -
     
(x) any item of collateral which is subject to any statute, rule, regulation or treaty of the United States (or any department or agency thereof) which provides for national or international registration for the creation or perfection of a security interest or which specifies a place of filing different from that specified in the UCC to create or perfect a security interest or the security interests in any property or other interests in property of the Borrower which may be considered to be located outside of the United States and are subject to the effect of any applicable foreign laws, rules, regulations or equitable principles;
     
(xi) any collateral which consists of as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut or goods that are or are to become fixtures;
     
(xii) any collateral to the extent such collateral is the subject of any transaction described in Section 9-109(c) or (d) of the UCC;
     
(xiii) the status of the Lender's security interests in any personal property as to which the filing of a financing statement is not an effective method of perfection under the UCC;
     
(xiv) the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision that purports to limit or affect the enforceability of a waiver of a right of redemption;
     
(xv) the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision that purports to impose limitations on attorneys' fees; and
     
(xvi) the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any provision that purports to provide for late charges, prepayment charges or yield maintenance charges, liquidated damages or "penalties" or acceleration of future amounts owing (other than principal) without appropriate discount to present value.
     
(f) In addition, our opinions in paragraph 10 are subject to (i) the limitations with respect to buyers in the ordinary course of business imposed by Section 9-320 and 9-330 of the UCC, (ii) all relevant provisions of and limitations contained in the UCC, including, without limitation, the limitations with respect to chattel paper, financial assets, documents, deposit accounts, goods covered by documents, investment property, letter of credit rights, money, instruments, securities and securities entitlements imposed by UCC Sections 8-302, 9-312 and 9-331, (iii) the provisions of UCC Sections 9-203(b)(1), 9-204(b), 9-334, 9-335 and 9-336 and (iv) Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Code, which limits the extent to which property acquired by a debtor after the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code may be subject to a security interest arising from a security agreement entered into by the de btor before the commencement of such case.
(g) Our opinion in paragraph 10 above is also subject to the
- 10 -
following assumptions: (i) that none of the personal property that constitutes Collateral are (A) goods covered by a "certificate of title" or (B) "consumer goods," as those terms are defined in the UCC; and (ii) that such security interests are neither (A) an "investment company security" (within the meaning of Section 8-103(b) of the UCC) nor (B) dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets.
     
(h) Our opinion in paragraph 10 above is further subject to the assumption that the Financing Statement contains the correct name and mailing address of the secured party and that the debtor has not changed its name, identity or organizational structure. We call your attention to Section 9-507 of the Delaware UCC, which provides that where the debtor so changes its name that a filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, the filing is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than four months after the change, unless an amendment to the financing statement which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within four months after the change. In addition, we note that under the provisions of the Delaware UCC, the Financing Statement will lapse five years from the date of filing unless a proper continuation statement i s filed within six months prior to the expiration of the five-year period. In rendering our opinions expressed herein, we have assumed that the Financing Statement has not lapsed, or been modified, terminated or released.
     
(i) In rendering the opinions expressed in Paragraph 6 and 8 above, we give no opinion as to the impact of actions referenced therein under or with respect to any provision in any of the Reviewed Documents which requires compliance with any financial measure, test or ratio.
     
This opinion letter is being delivered by us solely for your benefit pursuant to the provisions of
Section 4.1(b)
of the Amended Credit Agreement. We do not render any opinions except as set forth above.
     
By your acceptance of this opinion letter, you agree that it may not be relied upon, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to by any other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent in each instance, except that permitted assigns of any Lender may rely on this opinion letter as if it were addressed to them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may deliver copies of this opinion (a) to bank examiners and other governmental regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over you should they request a copy hereof in connection with their normal examinations, (b) to your independent accountants, attorneys and other professional advisors acting on your behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or the Loan Documents, (c) to designated persons pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental authority of competent jurisdiction , (d) pursuant to subpoena, request for production of documents or other discovery request or in connection with the defense by the
- 11 -
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender of any legal action arising out of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, (e) in connection with any legal action commenced by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender with respect to this opinion letter, and (f) to prospective permitted assigns of any Lender or any of the Notes and any prospective permitted Participant, provided that no such parties shall be permitted to rely on this opinion letter.
Very truly yours,

6.1      
Remedies upon Default
.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, it is agreed that the Collateral Agent shall have in any jurisdiction in which enforcement hereof is sought, in addition to all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies of a Credit Party under the UCC or other Applicable Law.  The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent shall include, without limitation, the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times:
(a)        With respect to any Collateral consisting of Accounts, General Intangibles (including Payment Intangibles), Letter-of-Credit Rights, Instruments, Chattel Paper, Documents, and Investment Property, the Collateral Agent may collect the Collateral with or without the taking of possession of any of the Collateral.
(b)        With respect to any Collateral consisting of Accounts, the Collateral Agent may (i) demand, collect and receive any amounts relating thereto, as the Collateral Agent may determine; (ii) commence and prosecute any actions in any court for the purposes of collecting any such Accounts and enforcing any other rights in respect thereof; (iii) defend, settle or compromise any action brought and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Collateral Agent may reasonably deem appropriate; (iv) without limiting the Collateral Agents rights set forth in Section 5.2 hereof, receive, open and dispose of mail addressed to any Grantor and endorse checks, notes, drafts, acceptances, money orders, bills of lading, warehouse receipts or other instruments or documents evidencing payment, shipment or storage of the goods giving rise to such Accounts or securing or relating to such Accounts, on behalf of and in the name of such Grantor; and (v) sell, assign, transfer, make any agreement in respect of, or otherwise deal with or exercise rights in respect of, any such Accounts or the goods or services which have given rise thereto, as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes.
(c)        With respect to any Collateral consisting of Investment Property, the Collateral Agent may (i) exercise all rights of any Grantor with respect thereto, including without limitation, the right to exercise all voting and corporate rights at any meeting of the shareholders of the Issuer of any Investment Property and to exercise any and all rights of conversion, exchange, subscription or any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to any Investment Property as if the Collateral Agent was the absolute owner thereof, including the right to exchange, at its discretion, any and all of any Investment
Property upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other readjustment of the Issuer thereof, all without liability except to account for property actually received as provided in Section 5.3 hereof; (ii) transfer such Collateral at any time to itself, or to its nominee, and receive the income thereon and hold the same as Collateral hereunder or apply it to the Obligations; and (iii) demand, sue for, collect or make any compromise or settlement it deems desirable.  The Grantors recognize that (a) the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of all or a part of the Investment Property by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77, (as amended and in effect, the 
Securities Act
) or the Securities laws of various states (the 
Blue Sky Laws
), but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire the Investment Property for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, (b) that private sales so made may be at prices and upon other terms less favorable to the seller than if the Investment Property were sold at public sales, (c) that neither the Collateral Agent nor any Credit Party has any obligation to delay sale of any of the Investment Property for the period of time necessary to permit the Investment Property to be registered for public sale under the Securities Act or the Blue Sky Laws, and (d) that private sales made under the foregoing circumstances shall be de emed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.
 
 
(d)        With respect to any Collateral consisting of Inventory, Goods, and Equipment, the Collateral Agent may conduct one or more going out of business sales, in the Collateral Agents own right or by one or more agents and contractors. Such sale(s) may be conducted upon any premises owned, leased, or occupied by any Grantor.  The Collateral Agent and any such agent or contractor, in conjunction with any such sale, may augment the Inventory with other goods (all of which other goods shall remain the sole property of the Collateral Agent or such agent or contractor).  Any amounts realized from the sale of such goods which constitute augmentations to the Inventory (net of an allocable share of the costs and expenses incurred in their disposition) shall be the sole property of the Col lateral Agent or such agent or contractor and neither any Grantor nor any Person claiming under or in right of any Grantor shall have any interest therein.  Each purchaser at any such going out of business sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor.
(e)        With respect to any Collateral consisting of General Intangibles, the Collateral Agent may exercise all of the rights granted to the Collateral Agent under the IP Security Agreement.
(f)         With or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, the Collateral Agent may enter upon, occupy, and use any premises owned or occupied by each Grantor, and may exclude the Grantors from such premises or portion thereof as may have been so entered upon, occupied, or used by the Collateral Agent to the extent the Collateral Agent deems such exclusion reasonably necessary to preserve and protect the Collateral.  The Collateral Agent shall not be required to remove any of the Collateral from any such premises upon the Collateral Agents taking possession thereof, and may render any Collateral unusable to the Grantors.  In no event
shall the Collateral Agent be liable to any Grantor for use or occupancy by the Collateral Agent of any premises pursuant to this Section 6.1, nor for any charge (such as wages for the Grantors employees and utilities) incurred in connection with the Collateral Agents exercise of the Collateral Agents Rights and Remedies (as defined herein) hereunder.
 
 
(g)        The Collateral Agent may require any Grantor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Collateral Agent at the Grantors sole risk and expense at a place or places which are reasonably convenient to both the Collateral Agent and such Grantor.
(h)        Each Grantor agrees that the Collateral Agent shall have the right, subject to Applicable Law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral, at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate.  Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor.
(i)         Unless the Collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value, or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market (in which event the Collateral Agent shall provide the Grantors such notice as may be practicable under the circumstances), the Collateral Agent shall give the Grantors at least ten (10) days prior written notice, by authenticated record, of the date, time and place of any proposed public sale, and of the date after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral may be made.  Each Grantor agrees that such written notice shall satisfy all requirements for notice to that Grantor which are imposed under the UCC or other Applicable Law with respect to the exercise of the Collateral Agents rights and remedies upon defa ult.  The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale or other disposition of such Collateral shall have been given.  The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.
(j)         Any public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale.  At any sale or other disposition, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine.  If any of the Collateral is sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of by the Collateral Agent on credit, the Obligations shall not be deemed to have been reduced as a result thereof unless and until payment is finally received thereon by the Collateral Agent.
(k)        At any public (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 6.1, the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor, the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any
claim then due and payable to the Collateral Agent or such other Credit Party from any Grantor on account of the Secured Obligations as a credit against the purchase price, and the Collateral Agent or such other Credit Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor.
 
 
(l)         For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof.  The Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full.
(m)       As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the Collateral and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.
(n)        To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Grantor hereby waives all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
6.2      
Application of Proceeds
.  After the occurrence of an Event of Default and acceleration of the Secured Obligations pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Credit Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the Collateral, as well as any Collateral consisting of cash, or any Collateral granted under any other of the Security Documents, in the manner set forth in Section 7.3 of the Credit Agreement.
 
 
7.1

7.2      
Savings Clause
. Nothing contained in this Article VII shall be construed to narrow the scope of the Collateral Agents Security Interest in any of the Collateral or the

Intellectual Property

3.1       Pay all renewal fees and other fees and costs associated with maintaining the Intellectual Property and with the processing of the Intellectual Property and take all other reasonable and necessary steps to maintain each registration of the Intellectual Property.
3.2       Take all actions reasonably necessary to prevent any of the Intellectual Property from becoming forfeited, abandoned, dedicated to the public, invalidated or impaired in any way.

To the knowledge of the Grantors, the use by the Grantors of the Intellectual Property does not infringe the rights of any Person in any material respect.  No holding, decision or judgment has been rendered by any Governmental Authority which would limit, cancel or question the validity of, or any Grantors rights in, any Intellectual Property in any respect that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the business or the property of any Grantor.

(a)        The Grantors obtaining rights to, and filing applications for registration of, any new Intellectual Property, or otherwise acquiring ownership of any newly registered Intellectual Property (other than the Grantors right to sell products containing the trademarks of others in the ordinary course of the Grantors business). 
(b)        The Grantors becoming entitled to the benefit of any registered Intellectual Property whether as licensee or licensor (other than the Grantors right to sell products containing the trademarks of others in the ordinary course of the Grantors business).
(c)        The Grantors entering into any new Licenses.
(d)        The Grantors knowing or having reason to know, that any application or registration relating to any material Intellectual Property may become forfeited, abandoned or dedicated to the public, or of any adverse determination or development (including, without limitation, the institution of, or any such determination or development in, any proceeding in the PTO or any court or tribunal) regarding the Grantors ownership of, or the validity of, any material Intellectual Property or the Grantors right to register the same or to own and maintain the same.
 
                                                                                                                                               
 
5.1       The provisions of this Agreement shall automatically apply to any such additional property or rights described in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 4.6, above, all of which shall be deemed to be and treated as Intellectual Property within the meaning of this Agreement.
5.2       Upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent, the Grantors shall execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Collateral Agent may request to evidence the Collateral Agents security interest in any Patent or Trademark and the goodwill and General Intangibles of the Grantors relating thereto or represented thereby (including, without limitation, filings with the PTO or any similar office), and the Grantors hereby constitute the Collateral Agent as their attorney-in-fact to execute and file all such writings for the foregoing purposes, all acts of such attorney being hereby ratified and confirmed;
provided, however
, the Col lateral Agents taking of such action shall not be a condition to the creation or perfection of the security interest created hereby.
Prior to the Collateral Agents giving of notice to the Grantors (i) following the occurrence of an Event of Default or (ii) pursuant to Section 6.1 below, the Grantors shall have the exclusive right to sue for past, present and future infringement of the Intellectual Property including the right to seek injunctions and/or money damages, in an effort by the Grantors to protect the Intellectual Property against encroachment by third parties,
provided, however
:
 
6.1       The Grantors first provide the Collateral Agent with written notice of the Grantors intention to so sue for enforcement of any Intellectual Property.  If, in the reasonable opinion of the Collateral Agent, the Grantors have failed to take appropriate action within sixty (60) days after such notice is given to Collateral Agent, upon notice to the Grantors, the Collateral Agent may (but shall not be required to) itself take such action in the name of the Grantors, with any damages recovered in such action, net of costs and attorneys fees reasonably incurred, to be applied as provided in Section 7.3 of the Credit Agreement.
6.2       Any money damages awarded or received by the Grantors on account of such suit (or the threat of such suit) shall constitute IP Collateral.
6.3       Following the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent, by notice to the Grantors may terminate or limit the Grantors rights under this Section 6.
  In the event of:
 
                                                                                                                                               
 
(a)        the Grantors failure, within five (5) days of written notice from the Collateral Agent, to cure any failure by the Grantors to observe or perform any of the Grantors covenants, agreements or other obligations hereunder; and/or
(b)        the occurrence and continuance of any other Event of Default,
the Collateral Agent, acting in its own name or in that of the Grantors, may (but shall not be required to) act in the Grantors place and stead and/or in the Collateral Agents own right in connection therewith.
 
  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may exercise all rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the State of New York, with respect to the Intellectual Property, in addition to which the Collateral Agent may sell, license, assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the Intellectual Property.  Any person may conclusively rely upon an affidavit of an officer of the Collateral Agent that an Event of Default has occurred and that the Collateral Agent is authorized to exercise such rights and remedies.
 
 
9.1       The Grantors hereby irrevocably constitute and designate the Collateral Agent as and for the Grantors attorney in fact, effective following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default:
(a)        To supplement and amend from time to time Exhibits A and B of this Agreement to include any new or additional Intellectual Property of the Grantors.
(b)        To exercise any of the rights and powers referenced herein.
(c)        To execute all such instruments, documents, and papers as the Collateral Agent determines to be appropriate in connection with the exercise of such rights and remedies and to cause the sale, license, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of the Intellectual Property.
9.2       The foregoing grant of a power of attorney, being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated by a duly authorized officer of the Collateral Agent.
9.3       The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to do any of the acts or to exercise any of the powers authorized by Section 9.1, but if the Collateral Agent elects to do any such act or to exercise any of such powers, it shall not be accountable for more than it actually receives as a
result of such exercise of power, and shall not be responsible to any Grantor for any act or omission to act except for any act or omission to act as to which there is a final determination made in a judicial proceeding (in which proceeding the Collateral Agent has had an opportunity to be heard) which determination includes a specific finding that the subject act or omission to act had been grossly negligent or in actual bad faith.
 
                                                                                                                                               
 
Any use by the Collateral Agent of the Intellectual Property, as authorized hereunder in connection with the exercise of the Collateral Agents rights and remedies under this Agreement and under the Credit Agreement shall be coextensive with the Grantors rights thereunder and with respect thereto and without any liability for royalties or other related charges.
 
This Agreement is being executed and delivered by the Grantors for the purpose of registering and confirming the grant of the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the IP Collateral with the PTO.  It is intended that the security interest granted pursuant to this Agreement is granted as a supplement to, and not in limitation of, the Security Interest granted to the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Credit Parties, under the Security Agreement.  All provisions of the Security Agreement shall apply to the IP Collateral.  The Collateral Agent shall have the same rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions with respect to the security interests created in the IP Collateral as in all other Collateral. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Security Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control with respect to the IP Collateral and the Security Agreement with respect to all other Collateral.
 
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF, BUT INCLUDING SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATION LAW.
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                               
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement under seal as of the day and year first above written.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Credit Parties, shall have the right (in its reasonable discretion) to hold the Pledged Securities in its own names as pledgee, the name of its nominee (as pledgee or as sub-agent) or the name of such Pledgor, endorsed or assigned in blank or in favor of the Collateral Agent.  The Pledgors will promptly give to the Collateral Agent copies of any notices
or other communications received by it with respect to Pledged Securities registered in the name of such Pledgor.
 
6.1       Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Pledgors shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and/or other consensual rights and powers inuring to an owner of the Pledged Securities or any part thereof to the extent, and only to the extent, that such rights are exercised for any purpose consistent with, and not otherwise in violation of, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and Applicable Law;
provided
,
however
, that the Pledgors will not be entitled to exercise any such right if the result thereof could materially and adversely affect the rights inuring to a holder of the Pledged Securities or the rights and remedies of any of the Credit Parties under this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or the ability of the Credit Parties to exercise the same.
6.2       Unless and until a Cash Dominion Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the Pledgors shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all cash dividends paid on the Pledged Collateral to the extent, and only to the extent, that such cash dividends are permitted by, and otherwise paid in accordance with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and Applicable Law.  All noncash dividends, and all dividends paid or payable in cash or otherwise in connection with a partial or total liquidation or dissolution, return of capital, capital surplus or paid-in surplus, and all other distributions (other than dividends and distributions referred to in the preceding sentence) made on or in respect of the Pledged Collateral, whether paid or payable in cash or otherwise, whether r esulting from a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the outstanding capital stock or partnership interests of the issuer of any Pledged Securities or received in exchange for Pledged Securities or any part thereof, or in redemption thereof, or as a result of any merger, amalgamation, arrangement, consolidation, acquisition or other exchange of assets to which such issuer may be a party or otherwise, shall be and become part of the Pledged Collateral, and, if received by the Pledgor, to the extent required to be paid to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, shall not be commingled by the Pledgors with any of their other funds or property but shall be held separate and apart therefrom, shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and shall be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).
6.3       Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Cash Dominion Event, all rights of the Pledgors to dividends that such Pledgor is authorized to receive pursuant to Section 6.2 above shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to receive and retain such dividends.  All dividends received by any Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this Section 6.3 shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Pledgor in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.21 of the Credit Agreement in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). Any and all money and other
property paid over to or received by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.3 shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.
 
6.4       Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of the Pledgors to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 6.1 shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to exercise such voting and consensual rights and powers;
provided
that
the Collateral Agent shall have the right from time to time following and during the continuance of an Eve nt of Default to permit any Pledgor to exercise such rights.  After all Events of Default have been cured or waived in writing by the Collateral Agent, the Pledgors will have the right to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers that they would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to the terms of Section 6.1.
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, it is agreed that the Collateral Agent shall have in any jurisdiction in which enforcement hereof is sought, in addition to all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or other Applicable Law.  The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent shall include, without limitation, the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times:
7.1       The Collateral Agent may sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Collateral, at public or private sale or at any brokers board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate.  Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor.
7.2       The Collateral Agent shall give the Pledgors at least ten (10) days prior written notice, by authenticated record, of the Collateral Agents intention to make any sale of the Pledged Collateral.  Such notice, (i) in the case of a public sale, shall state the date, time and place for such sale, (ii) in the case of a sale at a brokers board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Pledged Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange, and (iii) in the case of a private sale, shall state the date after which any private sale or other disposition of the Pledged Collateral shall be made.  The Pledgors agree that such written notice shall satisfy all requirements for notice to the Pledgors which are imposed under the UCC with respect to the exercise of the Collateral Agents rights and remedies upon default.  The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of any Pledged Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale or other disposition of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.
 
7.3       Any public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale.
7.4       At any public (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 7, the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of the Pledgors, the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to the Collateral Agent or such other Credit Party from the Pledgors on account of the Secured Obligations as a credit against the purchase price, and the Collateral Agent or such other Credit Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to such Pledgor therefor.
7.5       For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Pledged Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof.  The Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and the Pledgors shall not be entitled to the return of the Pledged Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Secured Obligations paid in full.
7.6       As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the Pledged Collateral and to sell the Pledged Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.
7.7       Each Pledgor recognizes that (i) the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of all or a part of the Pledged Collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77, (as amended and in effect, the 
Securities Act
) or the Securities laws of various states (the 
Blue Sky Laws
), but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire the Ple dged Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, (ii) that private sales so made may be at prices and upon other terms less favorable to the seller than if the Pledged Collateral were sold at public sales, (iii) that neither the Collateral Agent nor any Credit Party has any obligation to delay sale of any of the Pledged Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the Pledged Collateral to be registered for public sale under the Securities Act or the Blue Sky Laws, and (iv) that private sales made under the foregoing circumstances shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.
7.8       To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Pledgor hereby waives all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal which such Pledgor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
 
The proceeds of any sale of Pledged Collateral pursuant to Section 7, as well as any Pledged Collateral consisting of cash, shall be applied by the Collateral Agent as required pursuant to the terms of Section 7.3 of the Credit Agreement.
The Collateral Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement.  Upon any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Collateral by the Collateral Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the Collateral Agent or of the officer making the sale or other disposition shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Pledged Collateral so sold or otherwise disposed of and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
If the Collateral Agent reasonably determines that it is necessary to sell any of the Pledged Securities at a public sale, each Pledgor agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default hereunder, such Pledgor will, at any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the Collateral Agent, use its best efforts to take or to cause the Issuer of such Pledged Securities to take such action and prepare, distribute and/or file such documents, as are required or advisable in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Collateral Agent to permit the public sale of such Pledged Securities.  Without limiting any of its other indemnification obligations under the Loan Documents, each Pledgor agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Collateral Agent, each other Credit Party, any underwriter and their respective officers, directors, Affiliates and controlling Persons from and against all loss, liability, expenses, costs of counsel (including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel to the Collateral Agent), and claims (including the reasonable costs of investigation) that any of them may incur insofar as such loss, liability, expense or claim arises out of, or is based upon, any alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or in any notification or offering circular, or arises out of or is based upon any alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements in any thereof not misleading, except insofar as the same may have been caused by any untrue statement or omission based upon information furnished in writing to such Pledgor or the Issuer of such Pledged Securities by the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Party expressly for use therein.  Each Pledgor further agrees, upon such written request referred to above, to use its best efforts to qualify, file or register, or cause the Issuer of such Pledged Securities to qualify, file or register, any of the Pledged Securities under the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws or other securities laws of such states as may be requested by the Collateral Agent and keep effective, or cause to be kept effective, all such qualifications, filings or registrations.  The Pledgors will bear all costs and expenses of carrying out their obligations under this Section 9. 
Each Pledgor acknowledges that there is no adequate remedy at law for failure by them to comply with the provisions of this Section 9 and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, and therefore agree that their agreements contained in this Section 9 may be specifically enforced.
 
Each Pledgor agrees to do such further acts and things, and to execute and deliver such additional conveyances, assignments, agreements and instruments, as the Collateral Agent may at any time reasonably request in connection with the administration and enforcement of this Agreement or with respect to the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof or in order better to assure and confirm unto the Collateral Agent its rights and remedies hereunder.
This Agreement is being executed and delivered by the Pledgors for the purpose of confirming the grant of the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Pledged Collateral.  It is intended that the security interest granted pursuant to this Agreement is granted as a supplement to, and not in limitation of, the Security Interest granted to the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Credit Parties, under the Security Agreement.  All provisions of the Security Agreement shall apply to the Pledged Collateral.  The Collateral Agent shall have the same rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions with respect to the security interests created in the Pledged Collateral as in all other Collateral. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Security Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control with respect to the Pledged Collateral and the Security Agreement with respect to all other Collateral.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF, BUT INCLUDING SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATION LAW.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement under seal as of the day and year first above written.
