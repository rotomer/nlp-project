Item 5.02               Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
                                On February 9, 2011, GameStop Corp. (the "Company") entered into amendments to its Executive Employment Agreements with R. Richard Fontaine, Chairman, International, Daniel A. DeMatteo, Executive Chairman, J. Paul Raines, Chief Executive Officer, Tony D. Bartel, President, and Robert A. Lloyd, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, to eliminate the right of each executive to terminate his employment agreement as a result of a change-in-control of the Company.  The amendments also eliminated the automatic renewal provision of each agreement, except in the case of Mr. Fontaine, whose agreement does not contain an automatic renewal provision.
 
                                The amendments are included as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.5 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
