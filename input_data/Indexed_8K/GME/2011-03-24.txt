GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 24, 2011--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest multichannel video game retailer, today reported record sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011.
Financial Results
Total sales for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 4.8% to $3.69 billion, in comparison to $3.52 billion in the prior year quarter. Comparable store sales increased 2.6%. Net earnings increased 10.1% to $237.8 million, as compared to net earnings of $215.9 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 20.9% to $1.56, as compared to $1.29 in the prior year quarter.
For fiscal year 2010, total sales increased 4.3% to an all-time high of $9.47 billion, in comparison to $9.08 billion in fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales increased 1.1%. Through our multichannel network, GameStop customers purchased $290 million of console and PC digital offerings in 2010, a 61% increase over 2009.
Net earnings increased 8.1% to a record $408.0 million, including debt retirement costs of $6.0 million ($3.8 million, net of tax benefits), as compared to fiscal 2009 net earnings of $377.3 million, including debt retirement costs of $5.3 million ($3.3 million, net of tax benefits). Diluted earnings per share grew 17.8% to $2.65, including debt retirement costs of $0.02 per share, as compared to $2.25, including debt retirement costs of $0.02 per share, in fiscal 2009.
Paul Raines, chief executive officer, stated, In 2010, our innovations in e-commerce, digital offerings and PowerUp Rewards helped drive record sales, earnings and market share. Our focus in 2011 is to build on the success of our PowerUp Rewards program, expand our used business and increase our digital revenues, all while delivering strong financial results.
Rob Lloyd, chief financial officer, said, In 2010, GameStop generated more than $590 million of operating cash flow. We returned more than $380 million to shareholders through stock repurchases, reduced debt by $200 million as well as funded our new initiatives, digital acquisitions and global expansion. Overall, we begin 2011 in a position of financial strength and remain on track to meet our long-term return on invested capital (ROIC) goal.
Share Repurchase Update
During the fourth quarter, GameStop purchased 5.4 million shares at an average price of $20.77, or $112 million worth of stock. In February 2011, $500 million was approved to be used for share repurchases and debt retirement over the next 18 months, replacing the existing authorization. In fiscal 2011, GameStop has purchased 5.9 million shares at an average price of $19.88, or $118 million worth of stock.
Earnings Guidance
The following table provides detailed elements of our sales and earnings guidance for our 2011 first quarter and full year, based on current industry expectations and modest economic improvement.
In 2011, GameStop will continue to invest in strategic initiatives begun in 2010 in order to increase market share and drive digital sales growth. Our fiscal 2011 operating plan includes incremental costs of approximately $26 million, or $0.12 per share, for these projects.
GameStops fiscal 2011 capital expenditure budget of $170 million includes spending in the following categories:
$100 million in digital initiatives, technology systems and loyalty program support
$70 million for store remodels and store openings
For 2011, in the U.S., GameStop expects to open approximately 200 new stores, focusing on underserviced markets. The company also expects to close 200 stores, primarily those overlapping store locations due to past acquisitions with expiring leases. We will use our PowerUp Rewards loyalty program database to more effectively communicate with customers and thereby improve the sales transfer rate and overall store profitability. We expect to pursue opportunistic growth internationally.
Note that guidance only includes the effect of the shares purchased thus far in fiscal 2011 from the $500 million share and debt repurchase plan authorized in February 2011.
