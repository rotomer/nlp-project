The Plan attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.1 includes the amended Section 12.10.

Item 8.01.  Other Events.
At the Annual Meeting, Daniel DeMatteo, the Companys Executive Chairman, noting that Leonard Riggios term as a Director was ending at the Annual Meeting, made the following remarks:
While our annual meeting is a type of summation to the year, giving GameStop a chance to directly communicate with you -- our shareholders, I would like to interject a closing note.  As you know, Len Riggio has decided not to stand for re-election to the GameStop board due to other time commitments.  Len was the inspirational founder of
 
3
 
what has become the largest video game retailer in the world -- your company, GameStop.
He has provided not only insight and constant encouragement to me and our other co-founder, Dick Fontaine, but just as importantly has provided the roadmap that served as the foundation for perhaps the most important element of our companys success -- the creation of a culture that has demonstrated that GameStop is so much larger than the sum of the visible senior executive parts. He was a visionary with respect to our transformation and has always shown loyalty and support for the addition of new talent, capital and acquisitions to reposition us as a multichannel player.
Len has been the inspiration for a simple fact that, in my opinion, too many other companies seem to miss:  when everyone has a stake in the success of a venture and everyone has ideas that are equal at the table, we end up with better ideas from great people at all levels of our large and diverse organization.
We are very proud that our company is one reflecting the good work of so many.  I am very proud that Len Riggio, among so many key contributions, personalized that very basic, very rare, management direction from day one.
ACT SMALL/BE HUMBLE/THINK BIG/DREAM HUGE, a Len Riggio roadmap, has become our roadmap.
Len has been invaluable as a founder, board member, friend, and mentor, and I felt it important enough to share this recognition with all of you today.

A Tandem Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised by the holder thereof by giving written notice thereof to the Company and surrendering the applicable portion of the related Option.  Options that have been so surrendered, in whole or in part, shall no longer be exercisable to the extent the related Stock Appreciation Rights have been exercised.
Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights

(2)           The Committee shall determine any vesting schedules and terms, conditions, and limitations governing the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right granted pursuant to this Plan and set forth such terms in the Award Agreement governing such Stock Appreciation Right, provided that the per Share price used for determining appreciation of any Stock Appreciation Right shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one Share as of the date of the grant of such Stock Appreciation Right, unless approved by the stockholders of the Company;
 
(3)           All Stock Appreciation Rights granted hereunder shall expire and no longer be exercisable no later than ten years following the date such Stock Appreciation Rights are granted, provided that the term of a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall be identical as the term of the Option to which such Tandem Stock Appreciation Right relates;
 
(4)           The holder of a Stock Appreciation Right shall specify in his written notice of exercise the number of Shares with respect to which such Stock Appreciation Right is being exercised and whether payment shall be made in cash or in whole Shares (unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement governing such Stock Appreciation Right);
 
(5)           Each Tandem Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised only at the time and so long as a related Option, if any, would be exercisable or as otherwise permitted by applicable law;
 
(6)           Upon the exercise of a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right, the Option or part thereof to which such Tandem Stock Appreciation Right is related shall be deemed to have been exercised for the purpose of the limitation of the number of Shares to be issued under the Plan, as set forth in Section 3.1 of the Plan; and

Section 7.1                        The Committee may grant to any Participant a Restricted Stock Award pursuant to this Section 7.1.  A Restricted Stock Award is an Award that provides for the grant of Restricted Stock.  Restricted Stock is any Share issued with the restriction that the holder may not sell, transfer, pledge, or assign such Share and with such other restrictions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose (including any forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on the right to vote such Share, and restrictions on the right to receive any dividends thereunder), which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times, in installments or otherwise, as the Committee may deem appropriate.
Restricted Stock Awards

Section 7.2                      .  The terms of any Restricted Stock Award granted under this Plan shall be set forth in an Award Agreement which shall contain provisions determined by the Committee and not inconsistent with this Plan, including Section 12.10. The provisions of Restricted Stock Awards need not be the same for each Participant receiving such Awards.
Terms of Restricted Stock Awards
 
Section 7.3                      .  As soon as practicable after the date of grant of a Restricted Stock Award by the Committee, the Company shall cause to be transferred on the books of the Company Shares registered in the name of the Company, as nominee for the Participant, with such Shares heretofore described as Restricted Stock; provided, however, such Restricted Stock shall be subject to forfeiture to the Company retroactive to the date of grant if a an Award Agreement delivered to the Participant by the Company with respect to such Restricted Stock is not duly executed by the Participant and timely returned to the Company.  All Restricted Stock covered by Restricted Stock Awards under this Article 7 shall be subject to the restrictions, terms and conditions contained in the Plan and the Restricted Stock Agreement entered into by and between the Company and the Participant. Until the lapse or release of all restrictions applicable to a Restricted Stock Award, the share certificates representing such Restricted Stock shall be held in custody by the Company or its designee.
Issuance of Restricted Stock
 
Section 7.4                        Beginning on the date of grant of the Restricted Stock Award and subject to execution of the related Award Agreement, unless such Award Agreement provides otherwise, the Participant shall become a shareholder of the Company with respect to all Restricted Stock subject to the Award Agreement and shall have all of the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote such Restricted Stock and the right to receive distributions made with respect to such Restricted Stock; provided, however, that any Shares distributed as a dividend or otherwise with respect to any Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Plan as to which the restrictions have not yet lapsed shall be subject to the same restrictions as such Restricted Stock and shall be represented by book entry and held as prescribed in Section 7.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to compliance with Code Section 409A, the Committee may require that any dividends otherwise payable with respect to a Restricted Stock shall not be paid currently but shall instead be accumulated and paid upon lapse of the restriction for such Restricted Stock.
Shareholder Rights

Section 7.5                        None of the Restricted Stock may be assigned or transferred (other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution), pledged or sold prior to lapse or release of the restrictions applicable thereto.
Restriction on Transferability
.
 
Section 7.6                        Upon expiration or earlier termination of the forfeiture period without a forfeiture and the satisfaction of or release from any other conditions prescribed by the Committee, the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock shall lapse. As promptly as administratively feasible thereafter, the Company shall deliver to the Participant or, in case of the Participants death, to the Participants beneficiary, one or more stock certificates for the appropriate number of Shares, free of all such restrictions except for any restrictions that may be imposed by law.
Delivery of Shares Upon Release of Restrictions
.
 
Section 7.7                      .  Restricted Stock Awards shall be subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as shall be determined from time to time by the Committee.  All Restricted Stock shall be forfeited and returned to the Company and all rights of the Participant with respect to such Restricted Stock shall terminate unless the Participant continues in the service of the Company as an employee (or Director, consultant or advisor, as the case may be) until the expiration of the forfeiture period for such Restricted Stock and satisfies any and all other conditions set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee in its sole discretion, shall determine the forfeiture period (which may, but need not, lapse in installments) and any other terms and conditions applicable with respect to any Restricted Stock Award and the Committee has the discretion to modify the terms and conditions of any Restricted Stock Award.
Terms of Restricted Stock Awards
 
 
Section 8.1                      .  Performance Awards may be issued hereunder to Participants, for no consideration or for such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law, either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan.  The performance criteria to be achieved during any Performance Period and the length of the Performance Period shall be determined by the Committee upon the grant of each Performance Award.  Except as provided in an Award Agreement, Performance Awards will be distributed only after the end of the relevant Performance Period.  Performance Awards may be paid in cash, Shares, other property, or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of payment.  The performance goals to be achieved for each Performance Period shall be conclusively determined by the Committee and may be based upon the criteria set forth in Appendix A.  The amount of the Award to be distributed shall be conclusively determined by the Committee.  Performance Awards may be paid in a lump sum or in installments following the close of the Performance Period or, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, on a deferred basis.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of all Performance Awards so granted will be structured so that such Performance Awards either are not deferred compensation for purposes of Code Section 409A or comply with Code Section 409A.
Terms of Performance Awards

Section 9.1                      .  The Committee is authorized to grant Other Share-Based Awards that are payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to Shares, including Shares awarded purely as a bonus and not subject to any restrictions or conditions, Shares in payment of the amounts due under an incentive or performance plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company, stock equivalent units, and Awards valued by reference to book value of Shares. Subject to the provisions of this Plan, the Committee shall have authority to determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which such Awards shall be made, the number of Shares to be awarded pursuant to or referenced by such Awards, and all other conditions of the Awards; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of Shares granted pursuant to Other Share-Based Award(s) shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the Shares authorized for grant under this Plan.  The cap set forth in the foregoing proviso shall not apply to Shares granted pursuant to Other Share-Based Award(s) which were granted to a Participant in lieu of earned cash compensation.  In addition to the foregoing, grants of Other Share-Based Awards may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee may determine which may include, but are not limited to, continuous service with the Company or any Affiliate of the Company and/or the achievement of performance goals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Other Share-Based Awards granted under this Section 9.1 will be structured so that such Awards either are not deferred compensation for purposes of Code Section 409A or comply with Code Section 409A.
Other Share-Based Awards
 
 
Section 10.1                      .  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if the Committee determines that any Award is being granted to a Participant who is, or is likely to be, as of the end of the tax year in which the Company would claim a tax deduction in connection with such Award, a Covered Employee, then the Committee may provide that this Article 10 is applicable to such Award.
Covered Employees
 
Section 10.2                      .  If an Award is subject to this Article 10, then the lapsing of restrictions thereon and the distribution of Shares or other property pursuant thereto, as applicable, shall be subject to the achievement of one or more objective performance goals established by the Committee, which shall be based on the attainment of specified levels of performance criteria described in Appendix A.  Such performance goals also may be based solely by reference to the Companys performance or the performance of an Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company, or based upon the relative performance of other companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies.  The Committee may also exclude the impact of an event or occurrence which the Committee determines should appropriately be excluded, including (a) restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and other unusual or non-recurring charges, (b) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company or not within the reasonable control of the Companys management, or (c) a change in accounting standards required by generally accepted accounting principles.  Such performance goals shall be set by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m) of the Code, or any successor provision
Performance Goals

Section 10.3                      .  The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on Awards subject to this Article 10 as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Awards satisfy all requirements for performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto.
Other Restrictions
 
Section 10.4                      .

Limitations on Grants to Individual Participant
 
 
Section 11.1                      .The terms of any Award may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing the Award that, upon a Change in Control of the Company, (a) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the date of the Change in Control immediately vest and become fully exercisable, (b) restrictions and deferral limitations on Restricted Stock lapse and the Restricted Stock becomes free of all restrictions and limitations and becomes fully vested, (c) all Performance Awards shall be considered to be earned and payable (either in full or pro-rata based on the portion of the Performance Period completed as of the date of the Change in Control), and any deferral or other restriction shall lapse and such Performance Awards shall be immediately settled or distributed, (d) the restrictions and deferral limitations and other conditions applicable to any Other Share-Based Awards or any other Awards shall lapse, and such Other Share-Based Awards or such other Awards shall become free of all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the original grant, and (e) such other additional benefits as the Committee deems appropriate shall apply, subject in each case to any terms and conditions contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award.  The determination as to the occurrence of a Change in Control shall be based on objective facts and in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
Impact of Change in Control
 
 
Section 11.2                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of any Award Agreement may also provide that, if in the event of a Change in Control the successor company assumes an Award or substitutes for an Award as provided in Section 11.3, then each outstanding Award assumed or substituted for shall not be accelerated as described in Section 11.1.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Award shall be assumed or substituted pursuant to this Section 11.2 if such action would cause an Award not otherwise deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A to become or create deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A.
Assumption Upon Change in Control
.
 
Section 11.3                      .  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company, any Award

outstanding as of the effective date of such Change in Control will be cancelled in consideration for a cash payment or alternative Award (whether from the Company or another entity that is a party to the Change in Control) or a combination thereof made to the holder of such cancelled Award substantially equivalent in value to the fair market value of such cancelled Award.  The determination of such fair market value shall be made by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion.
 
 
Section 12.1                      .  Vested Options and Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan shall be exercised by the Optionee thereof or holder of such Stock Appreciation Right (or by his or her executors, administrators, guardian or legal representative, or by a Permitted Assignee) as to all or part of the Shares covered thereby, by the giving of written notice of exercise to the Company, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased or covered thereby, accompanied by payment of the full purchase price for the Shares being purchased under the Option.  Full payment of such purchase price shall be made at the time of exercise and shall be made (i) in cash or by certified check or bank check or wire transfer of immediately available funds, (ii) with the consent of the Committee, by tendering previously acquired Shares (either actually or by attestation, valued at their then Fair Market Value), provided that, in the case of a person then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, such Shares have been owned for a period of at least six (6) months, (iii) with the Consent of the Committee and only for Non-Qualified Stock Options, through net exercise, upon which such Participant electing such net exercise shall receive a number of Shares equal to the aggregate number of Shares being purchase upon exercise of such Option less the number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate purchase price of the Shares as to which the Option is being exercised, (iv) through any other method mentioned in an Award Agreement, or (v) with the consent of the Committee, any combination of (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv).  The notice of exercise, accompanied by such payment, shall be delivered to the Company at its principal business office or such other office as the Committee may from time to time direct, and shall be in such form, containing such further provisions consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee may from time to time prescribe. In no event may any Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted hereunder be exercised for a fraction of a Share. The Company shall effect the transfer of Shares purchased pursuant to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right as soon as practicable, and, within a reasonable time thereafter, such transfer shall be evidenced on the books of the Company.  No person holding or exercising an Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall have any of the rights of a holder of Shares subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, including any right to vote or receive dividends or distributions, until such Option or Stock Appreciation Right has been exercised.  Except as provided in Section 12.6, no adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to such date of exercise.

An Award that is transferred to a Permitted Assignee (i) may not be subsequently transferred otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and (ii) remains subject to the terms of this Plan and the Award agreement.
 
Section 12.3                      .  Unless the Committee otherwise determines, in the event of the termination of employment with the Company or any Affiliate of the Company of an Optionee or holder of a Stock Appreciation Right who is an employee or the termination or separation from service with the Company or any Affiliate of the Company of an advisor, consultant or a Director (who is an Optionee or holder of a Stock Appreciation Right) for any reason (other than death or disability as provided below), any Option(s) or Stock Appreciation Right(s) granted to such Optionee or holder of a Stock Appreciation Right (or its Permitted Assignee) under this Plan and not previously exercised or expired, to the extent vested on the date of such termination or separation, shall be exercisable as of such termination for a period not to exceed three (3) months after the date of such termination or  separation, provided, however, that in no instance may the term of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as so extended, exceed the lesser of ten (10) years from the date of grant or the original expiration date of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right.
Termination of Employment
 
Section 12.4                      .  In the event an Optionee or holder of a Stock Appreciation Right dies while employed by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company or while serving as a Director, advisor or consultant of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company, as the case may be, any Option(s) or Stock Appreciation Right(s) held by such Optionee or holder of a Stock Appreciation Right (or its Permitted Assignee) and not previously expired or exercised shall, to the extent exercisable on the date of death, be exercisable by the estate of such Optionee or Stock Appreciation Right or by any person who acquired such Option or Stock Appreciation Right by bequest or inheritance, or by the Permitted Assignee at any time within one year after the death of the Optionee or holder of a Stock Appreciation Right, unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, provided, however, that in no instance may the term of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as so extended, exceed the lesser of ten (10) years from the date of grant or the original expiration date of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right.
Death
 
Section 12.5                      .

Disability

after such termination or separation, unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms, provided, however, that in no instance may the term of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as so extended, exceed the lesser of ten (10) years from the date of grant or the original expiration date of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right. The term total disability shall, for purposes of this Plan, be defined in the same manner as such term is defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code.
 
Section 12.6                      .

With respect to each adjustment contemplated by the foregoing sentence, no such adjustment shall be authorized to the extent that such adjustment would cause an Award to violate the provisions of Section 409A of the Code (unless otherwise agreed by the Committee and the holder of such Award).  Any adjustments made by the Committee shall be binding on all Participants. If the Committee determines that an adjustment in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.6 would not be fully consistent with the purposes of the Plan or the purposes of the outstanding Awards under the Plan, the Committee may make such other adjustments, if any, that the Committee reasonably determines are consistent with the purposes of the Plan and/or the affected Awards.
Adjustments
 
Section 12.7                      .  The Committee may, from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan as it shall deem advisable, subject to any requirement for stockholder approval imposed by applicable law, including Sections 162(m) and 422 of the Code, or any rule of any stock exchange or quotation system on which Shares are listed or quoted; provided that such Compensation Committee may not amend the Plan without the approval of the Companys stockholders (i) to increase the number of Shares that may be the subject of Awards under the Plan (except for adjustments pursuant to Section 12.6), (ii) to materially increase the benefits of the Plan available to Participants, or (iii) to materially modify the requirements for participation in the Plan.  In addition, no amendments to, or termination of, the Plan shall in any way impair the rights of an Optionee or a Participant (or a Permitted Assignee thereof) under any Award previously granted without such Optionees or Participants consent.
Amendment and Modification of the Plan
 
Section 12.8                      .  The validity of any Award or grant of Options made pursuant to this Plan shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the compliance or noncompliance with Section 162(m) of the Code or Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

Repricing
 
Section 12.10                      .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary to the foregoing contained within this Plan, unless otherwise approved by the stockholders of the Company, any Award which is (i) performance-based shall have a minimum vesting period of one (1) calendar year or (ii) tenured (time-based) shall have a minimum vesting period of three (3) calendar years (with ratable vesting of no more than one-third of the aggregate applicable Option Award per calendar year), provided that the Compensation Committee shall have the discretion to waive such minimum vesting period with respect to Awards granted to new hires or Awards to non-employee Directors so long as the aggregate number of Shares subject to such waivers does not exceed 5% of the Shares subject to Awards under the Plan.
Minimum Vesting Periods
 
 
Section 13.1                      .  The Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall have the right to make all payments or distributions made pursuant to the Plan to a Participant (or a Permitted Assignee thereof) net of any applicable federal, state and local taxes as it determines in its discretion are required to be paid as a result of the grant of any Award, exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or any other event occurring pursuant to this Plan. The Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall have the right to withhold from wages or other payments otherwise payable to such Participant (or a Permitted Assignee thereof) such withholding taxes as it determines in its discretion may be required by law, or to otherwise require the Participant (or a Permitted Assignee thereof) to pay such withholding taxes. If the Participant (or a Permitted Assignee thereof) shall fail to make such tax payments as are required, the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to such Participant or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations. In satisfaction of the requirement to pay required withholding taxes, the Participant (or Permitted Assignee) may make a written election, which may be accepted or rejected in the discretion of the Committee, to have withheld a portion of the Shares then issuable to the Participant (or Permitted Assignee) pursuant to the Plan, having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the required withholding taxes.
Tax Withholding
 
Section 13.2                      .  Nothing in the Plan nor the grant of an Award hereunder shall confer upon any employee, Director, consultant, advisor or other individual the right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company or affect any right that the Company or any Affiliate of the Company may have to terminate the employment or service of (or to demote or to exclude from future Awards under the Plan) any such employee, Director, consultant, advisor or other individual at any time for any reason. Except as specifically provided by the Committee, the Company shall not be liable for the loss of existing or potential profit with respect to an Award in the event of termination of an
Right of Discharge Reserved

employment or other relationship even if the termination is in violation of an obligation of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company to the Optionee or Participant.
 
Section 13.3                      .  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Plan shall be unfunded and shall not create (or be construed to create) a trust or a separate fund or funds. The Plan shall not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate of the Company and any Optionee, Participant or other person. To the extent any Optionee or Participant holds any rights by virtue of any grant or Award made under the Plan, such rights shall constitute general unsecured liabilities of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company and shall not confer upon any participant any right, title, or interest in any assets of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company.
Unfunded Plan
 
Section 13.4                      .  All certificates for Shares delivered under this Plan shall be subject to such stock transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed or any national securities association system upon whose system the Shares are then quoted, any applicable Federal or state securities law, and any applicable corporate law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
Legend

Listing and Other Conditions
 
(1)           As long as the Shares are listed on a national securities exchange or system sponsored by a national securities association, the issue of any Shares pursuant to an Award shall be conditioned upon such Shares being listed on such exchange or system.
