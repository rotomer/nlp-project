GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 22, 2012--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest multichannel video game retailer, today reported sales and earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended Jan. 28, 2012.
Fourth Quarter Results
Total global sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $3.58 billion compared to $3.69 billion in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 3.0%. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 3.6% compared to the prior year quarter.
Excluding restructuring, impairment and debt retirement expenses, GameStops adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $239.5 million compared to adjusted net earnings of $238.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding restructuring, impairment and debt retirement expenses, were in-line with guidance at $1.73, a 10% increase compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.57 in the prior year quarter.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the company recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges of $81.2 million ($64.6 million, net of tax benefits), or $0.47 per share, to record international trade name impairment, exit certain international markets and non-core businesses, and close underperforming stores. The charges included fixed asset impairments, severance costs and lease termination fees. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted net income to GAAP net income is included with this release (Schedule III).
For the fourth quarter, GameStops net earnings were $174.7 million compared to net earnings of $237.8 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $1.27 compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.56 in the prior year quarter.
Fiscal 2011 Results
Paul Raines, chief executive officer, stated, In 2011, GameStop outperformed the video game market through disciplined execution of its core business and strategic initiatives. For 2012, we project operating earnings growth based on the continuation of our transformation, led by our strong pre-owned business, expanding digital offerings and emerging mobile categories.
For fiscal year 2011, total global sales were $9.55 billion, a modest increase over fiscal 2010. Full year consolidated comparable store sales declined 2.1% compared to fiscal 2010. By product category, sales in new hardware and other declined, while the company posted increases in both new and pre-owned software sales. Digital receipts, which are included in the other category, increased 57%.
Excluding restructuring, impairment and debt retirement expenses, GameStops adjusted net earnings for fiscal year 2011 were $405.1 million compared to adjusted net earnings of $412.8 million in fiscal 2010. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding restructuring, impairment and debt retirement expenses, were $2.87, a 7.0% increase compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.68 in fiscal 2010.
For fiscal year 2011, GameStops net earnings were $339.9 million compared to net earnings of $408.0 million in fiscal 2010. Diluted earnings per share were $2.41 compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.65 in fiscal 2010.
Capital Allocation Update
During the fourth quarter of 2011, GameStop repurchased two million shares at an average price of $22.38, or $45.3 million worth of stock. The company also redeemed $125 million of its senior notes making it debt-free at the end of the fiscal year.
Thus far in fiscal 2012, GameStop has repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $22.97, or $76.3 million worth of stock. On Feb. 7, 2012, the company initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Today, we are announcing that the board of directors has approved a new $500 million share repurchase authorization plan, replacing the remaining $253 million available on its existing authorization.
Rob Lloyd, chief financial officer, said, In 2011, through stock buybacks and debt retirement, GameStop returned more than $500 million of its free cash to shareholders. As we look ahead, we will focus on controlling SG&A spend and leveraging our past investments to increase earnings and further enhance shareholder value.
The timing and actual amount of shares repurchased will depend on several factors, including price, capital availability and other market conditions. This repurchase program does not have any specific limitations and may be suspended or terminated at any time.
2012 Outlook
GameStop projects that sales growth in 2012 will be primarily driven by an increase in digital sales, pre-owned video game products and mobile business initiatives. The company forecasts operating margin expansion of at least 20 basis points and a decline in capital expenditures of 15%, leading to an 8.0% to 15.0% increase in earnings per share over the $2.87 from 2011.
The following table provides detailed elements of our sales and earnings guidance for our 2012 first quarter and fiscal year, based on current industry expectations.
For 2012, in the U.S., GameStop expects to open approximately 100 new stores and close 150 stores. Internationally, the company expects to open stores opportunistically while keeping square footage flat.
Note: Current guidance only includes the effect of the shares purchased thus far in fiscal 2012 from the $500 million share and debt repurchase plan authorized in November 2011.

Non-GAAP Measures
GameStop reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes excluding the non-recurring and recurring items (restructuring, impairment and debt retirement expenses) from the companys financial results provides management and the investors with a clearer perspective of the current operating performance of the company and an improved comparison to prior period results. We believe it also provides useful information to investors and other users of GameStop's financial statements. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported GAAP financial results.
