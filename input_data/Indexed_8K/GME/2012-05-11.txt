GameStop Pre-Announces First Quarter EPS and Same Store Sales Guidance
GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 10, 2012--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest multichannel video game retailer, today confirmed its 2012 first quarter and full year earnings guidance.
GameStop is pre-announcing first quarter earnings per share results of $0.54 and same store sales of -12.5%, and reaffirming full year earnings per share guidance of $3.10 to $3.30. The company is outperforming the market in new video game product sales; however, first quarter same store sales results reflect light demand for AAA game launches and slower than expected store traffic during the quarter.
GameStop will provide second quarter and full year sales guidance in conjunction with its first quarter earnings release and conference call on Thursday, May 17, 2012.
