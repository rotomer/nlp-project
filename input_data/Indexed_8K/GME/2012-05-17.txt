Exhibit 99.1
GameStop Reports First Quarter 2012 Results
New business initiatives help drive margin expansion of 280 basis points
Company declares $0.15 quarterly dividend
GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2012--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest multichannel video game retailer, today reported sales and earnings for the first quarter ended April 28, 2012.
First Quarter Results
Total global sales for the first quarter of 2012 were $2.00 billion compared to $2.28 billion in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 12.2%. As announced last week, consolidated comparable store sales decreased 12.5% compared to the prior year quarter.
Paul Raines, chief executive officer, stated, GameStop continues to outperform the market in new game sales through the late stages of this console cycle. Despite slower store traffic during the quarter, we achieved our earnings target due primarily to gross margin expansion and positive profit contributions from our pre-owned, mobile and digital businesses. We expect those segments to fill the profitability gap as we transition to the new console cycle.
During the quarter, sales in the pre-owned and Other categories were down slightly, while sales in new hardware and software declined more than expected. Digital receipts, which are included in the Other category, increased 23% over the first quarter of 2011. Mobile sales, also included in the Other category, were $12 million, on plan to reach the companys goal for mobile sales of $150 to $200 million in 2012.
GameStops net earnings for the first quarter were $72.5 million compared to net earnings of $80.4 million in the prior year quarter. As announced last week, diluted earnings per share were $0.54, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.56 in the prior year quarter.
Capital Allocation Update
During the first quarter of 2012, GameStop repurchased 5.35 million shares at an average price of $22.70, or $121.5 million worth of stock. As of today, $455 million remains available for share repurchase under the current stock buyback authorization.
GameStops board of directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share payable on June 12, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 29, 2012.
Earnings Guidance
For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, GameStop expects comparable store sales to range from -11.0% to -5.0%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.10 to $0.18.
The company maintains its previously announced full year diluted earnings per share guidance range of $3.10 to $3.30. Full year comparable store sales are expected to range from -5.0% to flat.
Note: Current guidance only includes the effect of the shares purchased thus far in fiscal 2012.
