GameStop Reports Second Quarter 2012 Results
Quarterly dividend increased 67% to $0.25 per share
New businesses account for 10% of gross sales and drive significant margin expansion
GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 16, 2012--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest multichannel video game retailer, today reported sales and earnings for the second quarter ended July 28, 2012.
Second Quarter Results
Total global sales for the second quarter of 2012 were $1.55 billion compared to $1.74 billion in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 11.1%. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 9.3% compared to the prior year quarter. As expected, slow traffic due to a lack of new game releases caused sales of new software and hardware to decline sharply. While outperforming the new category as well as the overall market, pre-owned sales decreased 11.2%.
Other category sales, up 40.6% during the quarter, were primarily driven by new business channels. Digital receipts increased 27% to $134 million. Mobile sales, made up of tablet and pre-owned iDevice products, were $29 million, on track to reach the companys 2012 forecast for mobile sales of $150 to $200 million.
Paul Raines, chief executive officer, stated, We continue to see solid sales growth as well as strong margins in our new retail offerings and digital channels. We are focused on staying ahead of the curve as the competitive landscape evolves and we manage through the trough of the console cycle. Finally, the ongoing share buyback and increase in dividend demonstrate our confidence in the future of GameStop and our commitment to improving total shareholder returns.
GameStops net earnings for the second quarter were $21.0 million compared to net earnings of $30.9 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.16, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.22 in the prior year quarter.
Capital Allocation Update
During the second quarter of 2012, GameStop repurchased 7.6 million shares at an average price of $17.96, or $136.4 million worth of stock, compared to $34.6 million in the prior year quarter. As of today, $301.0 million remains available for share repurchase under the current stock buyback authorization.
GameStops board of directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share payable on Sept. 12, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Aug. 28, 2012. This dividend represents a 67% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in the first two quarters of 2012.
Earnings Guidance
For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, GameStop expects comparable store sales to range from -10.0% to -5.0%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $0.28 to $0.36.
Based on the current number of shares outstanding, the company is maintaining its previously announced full year diluted earnings per share guidance range of $3.10 to $3.30. Full year comparable store sales are expected to range from -10.0% to -2.0%.
Given the recent decline in the companys stock price, GameStops net book value of equity exceeds its market capitalization. As a result, the company is performing an interim impairment test of its goodwill and other intangible assets as required by the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350. Management believes any impairment would be related to the companys international reporting units, which have goodwill and other intangible assets recorded on the financial statements at a carrying value of $920 million. Any impairment charge resulting from this test would be material to the companys financial statements. However, any such potential impairment charge would be non-cash and would not impact the Companys on-going business operations, cash flows or financial condition.
Note: Current guidance only includes the effect of the shares purchased thus far in fiscal 2012.
