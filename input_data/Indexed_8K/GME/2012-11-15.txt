Exhibit 99.1
GameStop Reports Third Quarter 2012 Results
Company increases share repurchase authorization to $500 million
Company declares $0.25 quarterly dividend
GRAPEVINE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 15, 2012--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), the worlds largest multichannel video game retailer, today reported sales and earnings for the third quarter ended Oct. 27, 2012.
Third Quarter Results
Total global sales for the third quarter of 2012 were $1.77 billion compared to $1.95 billion in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 8.9%. Consolidated comparable store sales decreased 8.3%. Sales of new software, pre-owned software and new hardware declined during the quarter due to the longevity of the current console cycle and the difficult comparison of major new software titles released during the third quarter of 2012.
Sales in the Other category increased 31.1% during the quarter, primarily driven by new business channels. Digital receipts increased 31.8% to $127 million. Mobile sales, made up of tablet and pre-owned mobile products, were $43.2 million, on course to reach the companys 2012 forecast of $150 to $200 million.
Excluding impairment charges, GameStops adjusted net earnings for the third quarter were $47.2 million compared to adjusted net earnings of $53.9 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.38, exceeding the high-end of guidance by $0.02 per share.
Paul Raines, chief executive officer, stated, Diligent operational efforts in a tough video game market as well as continued margin expansion of 200 basis points resulted in third quarter earnings exceeding expectations. We are now focused on delivering a successful holiday quarter driven by great titles, an unrivaled loyalty program, exciting new businesses and the Wii U launch.
During the third quarter, GameStop recorded goodwill and other impairment charges of $678.8 million ($671.5 million, net of tax benefits) primarily as a result of finalizing a previously disclosed interim impairment test of the companys goodwill and other intangible assets. This impairment test was required under ASC 350 of generally accepted accounting principles due to a temporary decline in the companys stock price during the second quarter. The charges primarily relate to GameStops international reporting segments and are non-cash charges, which do not affect future operations, cash flows or liquidity position. A reconciliation of non-GAAP, or adjusted, net income to GAAP net income (loss) is included with this release (Schedule III).
Including the impairment charge, GameStops net loss for the third quarter was $624.3 million, compared to net earnings of $53.9 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted loss per share was $5.08, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.39 in the prior year quarter.
Capital Allocation Update
During the third quarter of 2012, GameStop repurchased 3.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of $20.59, or $76.8 million worth of stock. Today, the company also announced that the board of directors has approved a new $500 million share repurchase plan, replacing the remaining $242 million available on the existing authorization.
Rob Lloyd, chief financial officer, said, During the quarter, we reached an important milestone of repurchasing $1 billion of our stock since 2009. Our on-going buyback program and quarterly dividends highlight our commitment to improving total shareholder return through disciplined capital allocation.
GameStops board of directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share payable on Dec. 12, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Nov. 28, 2012.
Earnings Guidance
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, GameStop expects comparable store sales to range from -7.0% to +1.0%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to range from $2.07 to $2.27. For the full year, the company is maintaining its previously announced adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range of $3.10 to $3.30, excluding goodwill and impairment charges, based on weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 127,000,000. Incorporating third quarter results, full year comparable store sales are now expected to range from -9.0% to -6.0%.
Note: Current guidance only includes the effect of the shares purchased thus far in fiscal 2012.
