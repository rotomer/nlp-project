2Q 2004 FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT
 
Dear Investor/Analyst,
 
In conjunction with the release of Second Quarter earnings, we have prepared this financial statistical supplement to assist investors in understanding Genworth's financial results.
 
This supplement contains both historical and pro forma earnings and other financial information. Pro forma financial information included in this supplement reflects the effect of the company's corporate reorganization in conjunction with its recent initial public offering (IPO), completed May 28, 2004. As further detailed below, pro forma financial information is presented to enable a more meaningful comparison of Genworth's period-to-period results.
 
Additional detail on the basis of presentation of historical and pro forma financial information is provided below.
 
If you have additional questions, please feel free to contact me at Genworth Financial at 804-662-2693.
 
Regards,
 
Jean Peters
Senior Vice President
Investor Relations and Corporate Communications
 
 
 
Basis of Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information
 
As part of a corporate reorganization effected in connection with the company's IPO, the company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc. (GEFAHI), an indirect subsidiary of GE. The company also acquired certain other insurance businesses that were owned by other GE subsidiaries but managed by members of the company's management team. In consideration for the assets that the company acquired and the liabilities that the company assumed, the company issued various equity and debt securities to GEFAHI.
 
The company has prepared its historical financial information as if the company had been in existence throughout all relevant periods. The historical financial information through the date of the corporate reorganization (May 24, 2004) includes all businesses that were owned by GEFAHI, including those that were not transferred to the company, as well as the other insurance businesses that the company acquired from other GE subsidiaries in connection with the corporate reorganization. The financial information after the date of the corporate reorganization excludes businesses that the company did not acquire from GEFAHI. As a result, the company's historical financial information for periods prior to the corporate reorganization is not comparable to historical financial information for periods ending after that date.
 
Prior to the completion of the IPO, the company entered into several significant reinsurance transactions with Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC), an indirect subsidiary of GE. As part of these transactions, the company ceded to UFLIC, effective as of January 1, 2004, policy obligations under all of its in-force structured settlement contracts, which had reserves of $12.0 billion, and substantially all of its in-force variable annuity contracts, which had general account reserves of $2.8 billion and separate account reserves of $7.9 billion, each as of December 31, 2003. These contracts represent substantially all of the company's contracts that were in force as of December 31, 2003 for these products. In addition, effective as of January 1, 2004, the company ceded to UFLIC policy obligations under a block of long-term care insurance policies, which had reserves of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2003. As part of the reinsurance transactions, UFLIC ceded to the company in-force blocks of Medicare supplement insurance, which had reserves of $19 million.

2Q 2004 FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT
 
The unaudited pro forma financial information contained in this financial supplement reflects the company's historical combined financial information as adjusted to give effect to the transactions described below and certain other transactions as if each had occurred as of January 1, 2003:
 
 
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma financial information is based upon available information and assumptions that the company believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma financial information is for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of what the company's financial condition or results of operations would have been had the transactions described above occurred on the dates indicated, nor what they may be in the future.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
 
This financial supplement includes the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "net operating earnings." The company defines net operating earnings as pro forma net earnings from continuing operations, excluding pro forma after-tax net realized investment gains and losses (which can fluctuate significantly from period to period), changes in accounting principles and non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items. There were no non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items excluded from pro forma net operating earnings for the periods presented in this financial supplement other than a $22 million tax charge during the three months ended June 30, 2004 arising from the company's separation from GE. Management believes that analysis of net operating earnings enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers. However, net operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. In addition, the company's definition of net operating earnings may differ from the definitions used by other companies.
 
The table on page 6 of this financial supplement provides a reconciliation of pro forma net operating earnings to historical and pro forma net earnings. The term "net operating loss" as used in this financial supplement is also a non-GAAP financial measure and has a meaning corollary to "net operating earnings."
 
All net realized investment gains (losses) are reflected in the Corporate and Other Segment and are not reflected in the results of any of the company's other segments. As a result, the segment results contained in this financial supplement are presented on a net operating earnings basis, which is the same as net earnings under GAAP for all segments, except for the Corporate and Other Segment. For a reconciliation of pro forma net operating earnings for the Corporate and Other Segment to pro forma net earnings presented in accordance with GAAP, see the tables on pages 15 and 16 in this financial supplement.

2Q 2004 FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT
 
Definition of Sales
 
The term "sales" as used in this financial supplement means (1) annualized first-year premiums for term life insurance, long-term care insurance, group life and health insurance and life-contingent annuities; (2) deposits for universal life insurance, spread-based non-life contingent products and fee-based products; (3) gross written premiums for European payment protection insurance; and (4) new insurance written for mortgage insurance, which in each case reflects the amount of business the company generated during each period presented. Sales do not include renewal premiums or deposits on policies or contracts written during prior periods.
 
The company considers annualized first-year premiums, deposits and new insurance written to be a measure of the company's operating performance because they represent a measure of new sales of insurance policies or contracts during a specified period, rather than a measure of the company's revenues or profitability during that period. This operating measure enables the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources.

Industry Ratings
 
Our principal life insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's and Fitch as follows:
 
 
The A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's and Fitch ratings are not designed to be, and do not serve as, measures of protection or valuation offered to investors. These financial strength ratings should not be relied on with respect to making an investment in our securities.
 
A.M. Best states that its "A+" (Superior) rating is assigned to those companies that have, in its opinion, a superior ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. The "A+" (Superior) rating is the second-highest of sixteen ratings assigned by A.M. Best, which range from "A++" to "S".
 
GENWORTH FINANCIAL
2Q 2004 FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT
 
Industry Ratings (continued)
 
S&P states that an insurer rated "AA" (Very Strong) has very strong financial security characteristics that outweigh any vulnerabilities, and is highly likely to have the ability to meet financial commitments. The "AA" range is the second-highest of the four ratings ranges that meet these criteria, and also is the second-highest of nine financial strength rating ranges assigned by S&P, which range from "AAA" to "R." A plus (+) or minus (-) shows relative standing in a rating category. Accordingly, the "AA" and "AA-" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of S&P's 21 ratings categories.
 
Moody's states that insurance companies rated "Aa" (Excellent) offer excellent financial security. Moody's states that companies in this group constitute what are generally known as high-grade companies. The "Aa" range is the second-highest of nine financial strength rating ranges assigned by Moody's, which range from "Aaa" to "C." Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group, with 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest. Accordingly, the "Aa2" and "Aa3" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of Moody's 21 ratings categories.
 
Fitch states that "AA" (Very Strong) rated insurance companies are viewed as possessing very strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. Risk factors are modest, and the impact of any adverse business and economic factors is expected to be very small. The "AA" rating category is the second-highest of eight financial strength rating categories, which range from "AAA" to "D." The symbol (+) or (-) may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within a rating category. These suffixes are not added to ratings in the "AAA" category or to ratings below the "CCC" category. Accordingly, the "AA" and "AA-" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of Fitch's 24 ratings categories.
 
A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's and Fitch review their ratings periodically and we cannot assure you that insurance subsidiaries on a solicited or an unsolicited basis.
