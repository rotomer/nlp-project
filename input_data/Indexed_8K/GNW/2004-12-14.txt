Dear Investor/Analyst,
 
In advance of our Strategic Update meeting on December 15, 2004, we have prepared certain adjusted pro forma financial information, contained in this report, that reflects an upcoming change in the basis for the presentation of our pro forma financial results. We believe it is useful to investors and analysts for us to communicate this change, along with the resulting adjustments to our previously published pro forma financial information, in advance of year-end reporting.
 
Adjustments for pro forma financial information typically are required, consistent with SEC regulations, to be prepared assuming the relevant transactions were consummated at the . In our case, this means that the pro forma financial information previously provided for the first three quarters of 2004 assumed that all transactions effected in connection with our IPO had an effective date of January 1, 2003, the beginning of the most recent fiscal year currently presented. Beginning with the publication of our financial information for fiscal year 2004, consistent with SEC regulations, this assumed effective date will change to January 1, 2004.
beginning of the most recent fiscal year presented
 
The change in the assumed effective date will impact the pro forma adjustments related to the reinsurance transactions that we entered into during the second quarter of 2004. The after-tax impact of this change is a $6 million reduction of our pro forma net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. This impact is reflected entirely in the Retirement Income and Investments segment, where most of the reinsured business was written. The change in the assumed effective date does not have any impact on the pro forma adjustments relating to the other transactions effected in connection with our IPO, including adjustments related to businesses that were not transferred to us and adjustments for changes in our capitalization.
 
This report provides our previously published pro forma financial information, as adjusted for the upcoming change in the assumed effective date. Please note that this report provides only adjusted pro forma financial information that differs from previously published pro forma financial information as a result of the upcoming change.
 
Please call if you have any additional questions.

Basis of Presentation of Financial Information
 
As part of a corporate reorganization effected in connection with the company's IPO, the company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc. (GEFAHI), an indirect subsidiary of GE. The company also acquired certain other insurance businesses that were owned by other GE subsidiaries but managed by members of the company's management team. In consideration for the assets that the company acquired and the liabilities that the company assumed, the company issued various equity and debt securities to GEFAHI.
 
The company has prepared its historical financial information as if the company had been in existence throughout all relevant periods. The historical financial information through the date of the corporate reorganization (May 24, 2004) includes all businesses that were owned by GEFAHI, including those that were not transferred to the company, as well as the other insurance businesses that the company acquired from other GE subsidiaries in connection with the corporate reorganization. As a result, the company's historical financial information for periods prior to the corporate reorganization is not comparable to historical financial information for periods ending after that date.
 
Prior to the completion of the IPO, the company entered into several significant reinsurance transactions with Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC), an indirect subsidiary of GE. As part of these transactions, the company ceded to UFLIC, effective as of January 1, 2004, policy obligations under all of its in-force structured settlement contracts, which had reserves of $12.0 billion, and substantially all of its in-force variable annuity contracts, which had general account reserves of $2.8 billion and separate account reserves of $7.9 billion, each as of December 31, 2003. These contracts represent substantially all of the company's contracts that were in force as of December 31, 2003 for these products. In addition, effective as of January 1, 2004, the company ceded to UFLIC policy obligations under a block of long-term care insurance policies, which had reserves of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2003. As part of the reinsurance transactions, UFLIC ceded to the company in-force blocks of Medicare supplement insurance, which had reserves of $19 million.
 
The unaudited pro forma financial information contained in this report reflects the company's historical combined financial information as adjusted to give effect to the transactions described below and certain other transactions as if each had occurred as of January 1, 2003:
 
 
 
 
 
The unaudited adjusted pro forma financial information contained in this report reflects the company's pro forma financial information, as further adjusted to give effect to the same transactions described above as if each had occurred as of January 1, 2004.
 
The unaudited pro forma financial information is based upon available information and assumptions that the company believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma financial information is for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of what the company's financial condition or results of operations would have been had the transactions described above occurred on the dates indicated, nor what they may be in the future.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
 
This report includes the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "net operating earnings." The company defines net operating earnings as pro forma net earnings from continuing operations, excluding pro forma after-tax net realized investment gains and losses (which can fluctuate significantly from period to period), changes in accounting principles and non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items. There were no non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items excluded from pro forma net operating earnings for the periods presented in this financial supplement other than a $22 million tax charge during the three months ended June 30, 2004 arising from the company's separation from GE on May 28, 2004.
 
Management believes that analysis of net operating earnings enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers. However, net operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. In addition, the company's definition of net operating earnings may differ from the definitions used by other companies. The table on page 5 of this report provides a reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net operating earnings (as defined below) to historical and pro forma net earnings.
 
All net realized investment gains (losses) are reflected in the Corporate and Other Segment and are not reflected in the results of any of the company's other segments. As a result, the segment results contained in this financial supplement are presented on a net operating earnings basis, which is the same as net earnings under GAAP for all segments, except for the Corporate and Other Segment. For a reconciliation of pro forma net operating earnings for the Corporate and Other Segment to pro forma net earnings presented in accordance with GAAP, see the tables on pages 10 and 11 in this report. The term "net operating loss" as used in this report is also a non-GAAP financial measure and has an analogous meaning to "net operating earnings."
 
Beginning with its earnings release for the year ended December 31, 2004, the company will present pro forma financial information for periods in 2004 that assumes the transactions described above had occurred on January 1, 2004. The company believes it is useful to its investors and analysts for it to communicate this change now, along with the resulting adjustments to previously published pro forma financial information, to enable them to become familiar with the change in the assumed effective date in advance of the year-end reporting season. As a result, this report includes the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "adjusted pro forma."
 
The company defines adjusted pro forma to mean pro forma financial information for the first three quarters of 2004 (previously published and prepared in accordance with applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, assuming that the transactions described above under "Basis of Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information" had occurred on January 1, 2003), as further adjusted to give effect to such transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2004. The tables on pages 5-7 provide reconciliations of adjusted pro forma financial information to historical financial information.

Notes to Adjusted Pro Forma Financial Information
 
 
 
As a result, the company's unaudited pro forma combined statement of earnings reflects premiums and fees from these products issued after January 1, 2003, even though variable annuities and structured settlements issued during 2003 are included in the blocks of policies reinsured to UFLIC. The company's pro forma combined statements of earnings exclude the impact of the entire block of long-term care insurance policies that the company ceded to UFLIC as the company did not issue any new policies for this block in 2003, and the company will not issue any in the future.
 
Under the reinsurance transactions, the company receives an expense allowance to reimburse it for costs it incurs to service the reinsured blocks. Actual costs and expense allowance amounts will be determined by expense studies to be conducted periodically. The pro forma adjustments have been prepared assuming that actual costs incurred during the pro forma periods, as determined under the company's historical cost structure and allocation methods, were reimbursed by an expense allowance.
 
In addition to investment assets transferred to UFLIC in exchange for a reinsurance recoverable asset from UFLIC, concurrently, the company contributed $1.836 billion of capital to UFLIC which primarily represented the excess statutory capital in the company's insurance subsidiaries after giving effect to the reinsurance transactions. As a significant portion of the assets transferred and contributed were not owned for the entire period, the pro forma earnings adjustments to reduce net investment income and net realized investment gains were based upon a proportional allocation of investment income from the investment assets historically identified (1) as supporting the blocks of business reinsured for the reinsurance, and (2) as representing surplus of subsidiaries providing assets to be contributed to UFLIC for the contribution.
