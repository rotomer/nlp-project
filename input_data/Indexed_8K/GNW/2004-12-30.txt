Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 28, 2004, Genworth Financial, Inc. ("Genworth") entered into a Consideration Agreement with GE Capital International (Mauritius) ("GECIM"), a subsidiary of General Electric Company ("GE"). The Consideration Agreement sets forth the terms on which Genworth will participate in GE's previously announced sale (the "GE Sale") of 60% of its global outsourcing business to an acquisition vehicle owned by funds of General Atlantic Partners, LLC and Oak Hill Capital Partners, L.P. The GE Sale was completed on December 30, 2004. As a result of the GE Sale, GECIM owns 40% of Gecis Global Holdings, a Luxembourg Company ("GGH"), a new entity formed to hold the outsourcing business that was the subject of the GE Sale. Through its subsidiary, GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc. ("GEFAHI"), GE also is the beneficial owner of 70.1% of the outstanding common stock of Genworth.
 
Pursuant to the Consideration Agreement, upon the closing of the GE Sale, (1) we received consideration of $40 million from GECIM, and (2) we entered into an Outsourcing Services Amendment Agreement (the "Service Agreement") with Gecis International Holdings, Luxembourg, Swiss Branch Zug, a Luxembourg Company and a subsidiary of GGH ("GIH"). Pursuant to Service Agreement, we committed to purchase a minimum volume of services from GIH during an eight-year period. Our minimum volume commitment during each of the first five years of the Service Agreement will be $24 million, and our minimum volume commitment during the sixth, seventh and eighth years will be $18 million, $12 million and $6 million, respectively. In addition, we have agreed (1) to irrevocably waive our rights to acquire certain assets of GE's global outsourcing business, (2) to irrevocably waive certain non-compete rights with respect to the global outsourcing business and (3) to cause our subsidiaries to enter into new servicing agreements with GIH to replace existing service agreements, subject to the receipt of any required regulatory approvals.
 
Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
As part of the consideration for the assets that GEFAHI transferred to Genworth, in connection with Genworth's corporate reorganization and initial public offering, Genworth issued to GEFAHI a $550 million contingent note (as subsequently amended, the "Contingent Note"). Genworth was required to repay the Contingent Note solely to the extent that statutory contingency reserves from its U.S. mortgage insurance business in excess of $150 million were released and paid to Genworth as a dividend. The release of these reserves and payment of the dividend were subject to statutory limitations, regulatory approvals and other conditions. The Contingent Note provided that Genworth was required to use its reasonable best efforts to achieve the satisfaction of such conditions and to repay the Contingent Note by December 31, 2004. On December 23, 2004, all conditions to the release of such reserves and the payment of such dividend to Genworth were satisfied. As a result, on December 23, 2004, Genworth's U.S. mortgage insurance business paid a $700 million dividend to Genworth, and Genworth repaid the Contingent Note in full.
 
From time to time, Genworth expects to grant various awards to its directors and executive officers under the 2004 Genworth Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan. Forms of grant award agreements are attached hereto as exhibits and are incorporated herein by reference. In addition, as previously disclosed, for so long as GE owns more than 50% of Genworth's outstanding common stock, Genworth will be part of the GE group, and some of Genworth's executive officers will continue to participate in certain benefit plans established and maintained by GE. These benefit plans are identified in Item 9.01 of this current report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, dated May 24, 2004, among Genworth, GE, General Electric Capital Corporation, GEI, Inc. and GEFAHI (as previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission), Genworth reimburses GE for benefits that GE provides to Genworth's employees under these benefit plans.
