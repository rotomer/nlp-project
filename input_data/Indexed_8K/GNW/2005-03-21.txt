Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
In order to qualify the compensation payable to our executive officers for exclusion from the deduction limit in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, on March 16, 2005, the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of our Board of Directors adopted performance measures for 2005 and established the maximum annual awards payable to our executive officers for 2005. As was the case in 2004, the performance measures for 2005 are positive annual net earnings as determined under U.S. GAAP ("Net Earnings") and positive annual earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and accounting changes as determined under U.S. GAAP ("Consolidated Operating Earnings"). The actual annual awards payable to our executive officers for 2005 will depend on various company-specific and individual-specific performance measures, as determined by the Committee. These company-specific performance measures include, but are not limited to, Net Earnings and Consolidated Operating Earnings, as well as Net Earnings excluding after-tax net realized investment gains and losses, changes in accounting principles and non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items ("Net Operating Earnings"), Net Operating Earnings per share and per diluted share, and Net Operating Earnings divided by average stockholders' interest, excluding accumulated non-owner changes in average stockholders' interest ("Operating Return On Equity"). The Committee has absolute discretion to determine the amounts, if any, to be awarded to our executive officers for 2005, subject to the maximum award limit described above.
 
At its meeting on March 16, 2005, the Committee also approved the following base salaries, effective May 1, 2005, for our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and for each of the persons who were our four other most highly compensated executive officers (the "Named Executive Officers") in 2004: Michael D. Fraizer, $1,125,000; Thomas H. Mann, $615,000; Pamela S. Schutz, $500,000; George R. Zippel, $500,000; and K. Rone Baldwin, $475,000.
