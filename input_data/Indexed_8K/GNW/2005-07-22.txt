Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On July 20, 2005, Genworth Financial, Inc. ("Genworth") adopted the following employee benefit plans in which its executive officers are eligible to participate:
 
(1) the Genworth Financial, Inc. Retirement and Savings Restoration Plan (the "Restoration Plan");
 
(2) the Genworth Financial, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"); and
 
(3) the Genworth Financial, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan").
 
Each of these plans will become effective on the date that the ownership of Genworth by General Electric Company ("GE," our current majority stockholder) ceases to be more than 50% (the "Trigger Date").
 
The Restoration Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan established and maintained to provide a select group of highly compensated and management employees, including Genworth's chief executive officer and its other four most highly compensated executive officers (collectively, the "Named Executive Officers"), with matching contributions that they are precluded from receiving under the Genworth Financial, Inc. Retirement and Savings Plan (the "Retirement and Savings Plan") as a result of limitations imposed under Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") Sections 401(a)(17) and 415. Each participant shall become 100% vested in his or her Restoration Plan account upon the attainment of age 60, or upon his or her death or disability, or upon a change of control of Genworth. A participant must be vested and terminate service in order to receive a payout under the Restoration Plan. This description of the Restoration Plan is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Restoration Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
 
The SERP is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan established and maintained to provide a select group of highly compensated and management executive employees, including the Named Executive Officers, with additional retirement benefits. The SERP is intended to replace up to a maximum of 50% of the participant's average annual compensation, as defined in the plan. The benefits paid under the SERP are reduced by the value of retirement benefits to which the participant is entitled under the Retirement Plan feature of the Retirement and Savings Plan. A participant will become 100% vested in his or her SERP account upon the attainment of age 60 and five years of service, or upon his or her death or disability, or upon a change of control of Genworth. A participant must be vested and terminate service in order to receive payments under the SERP. This description of the SERP is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the SERP, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
 
The Deferred Compensation Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan established and maintained to provide a select group of highly compensated and management executive employees, including the Named Executive Officers, with the ability to defer receipt of a portion of their salary and/or bonus. A participant may defer between 10% and 75% of his or her salary and between 25% and 100% of his or her bonus for a fiscal year, and may elect to have
such deferred amount, plus any earnings thereon, paid upon the participant's termination of employment with Genworth. Participants are always 100% vested in their Deferred Compensation Plan accounts. Generally, a participant must have separated from service in order to receive a distribution from the Deferred Compensation Plan. This description of the Deferred Compensation Plan is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
 
Item 5.05 Amendments to the Registrant's Code of Ethics, or Waiver of a Provision of the Code of Ethics.
 
All of Genworth's directors, officers and employees, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller, are currently subject to the requirements of the code of ethics used by GE (the "GE Code of Ethics"), which Genworth previously adopted as its own code of ethics. On July 20, 2005, Genworth adopted a new code of ethics, (the "Genworth Code of Ethics"), which will become effective on the Trigger Date (as defined in Item 1.01 above). The Genworth Code of Ethics will be applicable to all of its directors, officers and employees and is substantially similar to the GE Code of Ethics, with certain changes primarily related to differences in the nature of Genworth's businesses as compared to GE's.
Integrity: The Spirit and the Letter of Our Commitment,
Genworth Financial Code of Ethics
 
For example, the Genworth Code of Ethics places greater emphasis on requirements relating to international financial transactions as opposed to international trade controls. Additionally, the Genworth Code of Ethics does not address certain aspects of working with governments, particularly with respect to contract proposal, negotiation and performance. Further, the Genworth Code of Ethics differs from its GE counterpart in the section addressing fair employment practices by stating that Genworth is an "Equal Opportunity" employer and highlighting the complaint procedure for unlawful harassment. The Genworth Code of Ethics also omits a section that appears in the GE Code of Ethics regarding compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as compliance with these laws is covered more generally elsewhere in the Genworth Code of Ethics. Several other technical and conforming changes also were made to ensure internal consistency. This description of the Genworth Code of Ethics is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Genworth Code of Ethics, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 14.1 and incorporated by reference into this Item 5.05.

Unless otherwise indicated, all references to Articles, Sections, and subsections shall be to the Plan as set forth in this document. The Plan and all rights thereunder shall be construed and enforced in accordance with ERISA and, to the extent that state law is applicable, the laws of the State of Virginia.

Subject to such limitations as may from time to time be required by law, imposed by the Company, or contained elsewhere in the Plan, and subject to such operating rules and procedures as may be imposed from time to time by the Company, prior to and effective for each Adjustment Date, each Participant may communicate to the Company a direction as to how his or her Account should be deemed to be invested among such categories of deemed investments as may be made available by the Company hereunder. Such direction shall designate the percentage (in any whole percent multiples) of each portion of the Participant's Account that is requested to be deemed to be invested in such categories of deemed investments and shall be subject to the following rules:

In the event a Participant incurs a financial hardship as a result of an "unforeseeable emergency" (as such term is defined below), the Participant may apply to the Committee for the distribution of all or a portion of the Participant's Account. The application shall provide such information and be in such form as the Committee shall require. The Committee, in the exercise of its sole and absolute discretion, may approve or deny the request in whole or in part, and shall direct the Participating Company accordingly. The term "unforeseeable emergency" means a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant's spouse, or a dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of the Code) of the Participant, loss of the Participant's property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. In no event may the amounts distributed with respect to an unforeseeable emergency exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, any payment made pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(vi) of the Code and the regulations (or similar guidance) promulgated thereunder (or any successor provisions).

The decision upon review shall be made not later than sixty (60) days after the Committee's receipt of a request for a review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing and the Participant is informed of the need for the extension within the initial sixty (60) day period. When an extension is necessary, a decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than 120 days after receipt of the request for review. If notice of the decision on the review is not furnished in accordance with this Section 8.5(d), the claim shall be deemed denied and the Participant shall be permitted to exercise his right to a legal remedy.

Table of Contents
INTRODUCTION
 
Genworth Financial has issued one set of policies to implement its Code of Ethics and to help Genworth employees around the world take a consistent approach to key integrity issues. This booklet contains basic information about each of our policies. The underlying responsibilities of all employees and leaders, penalties for violations and how to handle an integrity concern are described in this introduction.
 
Who must follow Genworth policies
 
Genworth directors, officers and employees
 
Genworth policies apply to all directors, officers, and employees of the Company throughout the world.
 
Subsidiaries and other controlled affiliates
 
Subsidiaries and other controlled affiliates throughout the world must adopt and follow corresponding policies. A controlled affiliate is a subsidiary or other entity in which Genworth owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the voting rights, or in which the power to control the entity is possessed by or on behalf of Genworth.
 
Non-controlled affiliates
 
Employees serving as directors (or in equivalent positions) of non-controlled affiliates should, to the extent possible, encourage such affiliates to adopt and follow corresponding policies.
 
Third parties
 
All Genworth businesses must require that others representing Genworth  such as consultants, agents, sales representatives, distributors and independent contractors  agree to follow applicable Genworth policies. Leaders and employees must:

Which law applies
 
Genworth conducts business in more than 20 countries around the world. Our employees are citizens of many different countries. As a result, our operations are subject to the laws of many countries, provinces, states, municipalities and organizations such as the European Union.
 
An important challenge for all of us is to understand how these laws may apply to our operations. Genworth, the parent company, is a corporation organized in the United States. The laws of the United States frequently extend to the operations of Genworth and its affiliates throughout the world as well as to the business activities of Genworth employees wherever they live and work. Other countries may also apply their own laws outside of their borders to their own citizens and to corporations that are organized under their laws, such as Genworth subsidiaries or other controlled affiliates.
 
In the policies that follow, the references to the laws of the United States and the other countries where we do business reflect the reality that a global company is regulated by many different laws at the same time. In some instances, there may be a conflict between the applicable laws of two or more countries. When you encounter such a conflict, it is especially important to consult Company legal counsel to understand how to resolve that conflict properly.
 
Employee responsibilities
 
Each policy identifies specific responsibilities. However, you must also follow these basic obligations common to all policies:

Regularly, each officer or manager reporting to a business leader (business CEO) must review policy compliance with his or her direct reports and provide the results of those reviews to the business leader. Periodically, the business leader will report on the results of those reviews in meetings to be scheduled by the Board of Directors.
 
Penalties for violations
 
Employees who violate the spirit or letter of Genworth's policies are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. The following are examples of conduct that may result in discipline:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Violation of a Genworth policy can also mean breaking the law, subjecting you or the Company to criminal penalties (fines or jail sentences) or civil sanctions (damage awards or fines).

INTEGRITY CONCERNS
 
When you have an integrity concern
 
One of the most important responsibilities each of us has as a Genworth employee is the obligation to raise a concern about a possible violation of Genworth policy or the law. Sometimes it may seem difficult to raise such a concern. Some of us may even feel it is a breach of personal ethical standards to do so. If you experience that sense of conflict, it's important to remember the tremendous harm that not raising a concern can cause, including:
 
 
 
 
Those are the reasons the Company requires that employees not sit silently when they have a policy concern. The point of raising a concern is not to get a friend in trouble, but to protect a colleague or neighbor from potential harm.
 
How to raise an integrity concern
 
The Company offers you many ways to get answers to your questions about integrity issues and to raise any concern about what might be a violation of Genworth policy:

IMPROPER PAYMENTS
 
Policy overview
 
Genworth employees should not offer anything of value to obtain any improper advantage in selling goods and services, conducting financial transactions, or representing the Company's interests to governmental authorities. This policy sets forth Genworth's standards of conduct and practices for certain kinds of payments, entertainment and political contributions. Genworth must not authorize, involve itself in, or tolerate any business practice that does not follow this policy.
 
A violation of this policy can result in severe civil and criminal penalties, under the laws of more than one country. All countries prohibit the bribery of their own public officials, and many also prohibit the bribery of officials of other countries. Genworth's policy goes beyond these laws and prohibits improper payments in all of our activities, both with governments and in the private sector.
 
Core requirements
 
 
This policy does not prohibit lawful reimbursement for reasonable and bona fide expenditures  for example, travel and living expenses incurred by customers and directly related to the promotion of products or services, or to the execution of a contract.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL TRANSACTION CONTROLS
 
Policy overview
 
Many countries regulate international financial transactions, for a variety of reasons, including national security and foreign policy. In addition, the United States prohibits any cooperation with boycotts against countries friendly to the United States or firms which may be "blacklisted" by certain groups or countries. For Genworth and its affiliates to do business in today's global environment, we must understand and follow all of these laws and regulations.
 
U.S. restrictions on international trade are very broad and complex. They apply to Genworth; its U.S.- incorporated affiliates and all their employees, regardless of nationality; and to U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens wherever located. They may also apply to non-U.S. incorporated affiliates and their employees. As a further complication, legal measures to block the application of certain U.S. restrictions have been adopted by some countries, such as the members of the European Union, and Canada and Mexico. Consequently, Genworth, its affiliates and employees located in those countries may be faced with conflicting legal requirements that must be handled by Company legal counsel.

MONEY LAUNDERING PREVENTION
 
Policy overview
 
People who are involved in criminal activity (for example, narcotics trafficking, bribery, fraud) may try to "launder" the proceeds of their crimes to hide them or make the proceeds appear legitimate. More than 100 countries now have laws against money laundering, which criminalize the acceptance or processing of the proceeds of criminal activity. Genworth is committed to complying fully with all applicable anti-money laundering laws throughout the world. Genworth will conduct business only with reputable customers who are involved in legitimate business activities and whose funds are derived from legitimate sources. Each Genworth business is required to implement a "Know Your Customer" procedure and to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Company does not accept forms of payment that have been identified as means of laundering money. Genworth's integrity and reputation can be severely damaged by failing to detect those customer relationships and transactions that place us at risk.

PRIVACY
 
Policy overview
 
In our increasingly information-based society, individual consumer, medical, financial, and other sensitive personal information must be adequately protected. Genworth is committed to protecting personal information that we collect from or maintain about individual consumers. Each employee must take care to protect individually identifiable consumer information and other sensitive personal information from inappropriate or unauthorized use or disclosure, and each Genworth business must implement fair and responsible privacy and information protection procedures and take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with such procedures.

SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS
 
Policy overview
 
Genworth bases its relationships with suppliers on lawful, efficient and fair practices. We also expect our suppliers to adhere to applicable legal requirements in their business relationships, including those with their employees, their local communities, and Genworth. The quality of our supplier relationships often has a direct bearing on the quality of our customer relationships. Likewise, the quality of our suppliers' products and services affects the quality of our own products and services.

WORKING WITH GOVERNMENTS
 
Policy overview
 
Genworth conducts business with many local, state, provincial and national governments (including government-owned enterprises). Genworth also interacts with many government agencies, ministries, officials and public international agencies. In conducting business with all government entities, Genworth is committed to following the highest ethical standards and complying with applicable laws and regulations.
 
Genworth's Code of Ethics requires employees to be honest, fair and trustworthy. Our standards require more than just obeying the letter of the law; they require all employees to uphold the spirit of the law and adhere to the highest standards of integrity, avoiding even the appearance of impropriety. Genworth employees must observe these standards in addressing the special requirements often associated with government transactions and regulations. Genworth employees must comply with all laws and regulations applicable to government business, and must be truthful and accurate when dealing with all government officials, representatives or agencies that regulate the markets in which Genworth does business.

COMPLYING WITH THE COMPETITION LAWS
 
Policy overview
 
The competition laws (referred to in the United States as the antitrust laws) are a critical part of the business environment in which Genworth operates. They govern the day-to-day conduct of Genworth's businesses in setting prices and other aspects of purchasing, selling and marketing goods and services. Genworth is dedicated to compliance with the competition laws in all of its activities. Every Genworth employee is responsible for compliance with those laws, as well as for promptly raising concerns about any possible violations to Company legal counsel, senior management, or a Company ombudsperson.

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
 
Policy overview
 
Genworth is an Equal Opportunity employer. The Company provides equal access to employment opportunities for all applicants and employees in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws, without regard to race, color, national origin, religion, gender, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation or marital status, amnesty or status as a covered veteran, or any other characteristic protected by state or federal law.
 
Genworth is committed to observing all applicable labor and employment laws in every location where the Company has facilities, including those laws that pertain to freedom of association, privacy, recognition of the right to engage in collective bargaining, the prohibition of forced, compulsory and child labor, and those laws that pertain to the elimination of any improper employment discrimination.
 
The Company believes that its commitment to fair employment practices and focus on the fair treatment of all applicants and employees not only contributes to Genworth's success, but enhances the progress of individuals and the communities where our businesses are located.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
 
Policy overview
 
Genworth recognizes and respects that employees may take part in legitimate financial, business and other activities outside their jobs. However, those activities must be lawful and free of conflicts with their responsibilities as Genworth employees. Employees must not misuse Genworth resources or influence, or discredit Genworth's good name and reputation. The effectiveness of this policy depends in large part on the cooperation of all employees in disclosing any situations that may be contrary to the intent of the policy and the ethical standards that it expresses.

CONTROLLERSHIP
 
Policy overview
 
Controllership comprises four elements that are vital to Genworth's unyielding commitment to maximize the value we create for share owners: (1)
compliance
with applicable laws, regulations and Company policies; (2)
rigorous business processes
to ensure that management decisions are based on sound economic analysis (including a prudent consideration of risks), and that Genworth's physical, financial and intellectual property assets are safeguarded and optimally employed; (3
) integrity in communications
to ensure timely, complete, fair, understandable and accurate reporting of actual and forecasted financial information and non-financial information in reports and documents that Genworth files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies and in public communications; (4)
preservation
of required documents and records, including all documents that are known to be relevant to pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation, audits or investigations. Through the unwavering commitment of all employees to controllership, we create an environment in which we can all take pride.

INSIDER TRADING OR DEALING & STOCK TIPPING
 
Policy overview
 
Genworth is committed to the principles of fair and open markets for publicly traded securities throughout the world  markets where everyone has an equal chance to succeed. This policy establishes standards of conduct for employees and others who obtain material or price-sensitive non-public information (inside information) through their work for Genworth. Insider trading, insider dealing and stock tipping are criminal offenses in most countries where Genworth does business. The requirements of this policy include full compliance with the laws prohibiting insider trading, insider dealing and stock tipping.
 
Insider trading or dealing means personally buying or selling stock or other securities of any company while in possession of inside information about the company. Stock tipping means disclosing inside information about a company  for example, to a relative, colleague or friend  to enable the person to buy or sell stock or other securities of the company on the basis of such information. This policy sets forth guidelines designed to avoid even the appearance of insider trading, insider dealing or tipping. It is not meant to restrict the freedom of employees to make appropriate personal investments, or the Company's right to legitimately use and disclose inside information in the ordinary conduct of its business.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Policy overview
 
Among Genworth's most valuable assets is its intellectual property  patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary information. It is Genworth's policy to establish, protect, maintain and defend its rights in all commercially significant intellectual property and to use those rights in responsible ways. All employees must take steps to safeguard these assets.
 
In addition to protecting Genworth's intellectual property rights, Genworth respects the valid intellectual property rights of others. Unauthorized use of the intellectual property rights of others may expose the Company to civil law suits and damages. In many countries, theft and misappropriation of trade secrets, proprietary information or other intellectual property may result in significant fines and criminal penalties to both Genworth and to the individual. New Company products, services, processes and software, and any proposed use of the intellectual property of others, should be timely and reasonably reviewed for infringement.
