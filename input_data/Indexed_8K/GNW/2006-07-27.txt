Segment Results
Segment net operating earnings presented below exclude net investment gains (losses), net of taxes and other adjustments. The following discussion of segment net operating earnings below are on an after-tax basis.
 
Protection segment net operating earnings increased 14 percent to $151 million, driven by strong growth in both life insurance and payment protection, partially offset by a decline in LTC results. Life insurance earnings increased 40 percent from new business growth and favorable mortality. Life earnings in the prior year quarter included an $8 million charge related to a deferred gain correction on a reinsured block of term policies. LTC earnings were $37 million as in-force growth and higher Medicare supplement earnings were more than offset by higher incurred claims, declining investment yields, and lower termination rates on older-issued policies, some with expiring reinsurance coverage. Both quarters
 
included non-recurring items: the current quarter included a $15 million favorable reserve adjustment for benefit elections on a large group case and $9 million in unfavorable adjustments on a reinsured policy block. The prior year quarter unusual items netted to a favorable $8 million. Payment protection earnings increased 21 percent to $29 million reflecting new business growth, improved underwriting margins related to a shift in business mix, and lower taxes. Group earnings were flat as business growth and lower expenses were offset by higher loss ratios.
Term life sales grew 9 percent from competitive pricing, distribution expansion and focused customer service. Total universal life sales more than doubled to $32 million reflecting a nearly three-fold increase in excess deposits and a 67 percent rise in annualized first year deposits. Individual LTC sales increased $3 million to $41 million driven by 23 percent higher sales from independent distribution that more than offset lower career channel sales. Medicare supplement product sales increased $6 million to $9 million, reflecting the Continental Life acquisition. Payment protection sales overall grew 5 percent adjusted for foreign exchange. Strong sales in growth markets were offset by lower U.K. sales. Group sales were up 16 percent to $44 million from expansion of distribution, product offerings and service levels.
 
RI&I segment net operating earnings were $57 million, versus $60 million in the prior year period that included a $9 million tax benefit that did not recur. Current spread-based retail results benefited from higher investment income and wider spreads, offset by $4 million higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) mainly related to increased lapse rates on older, low-return fixed annuity blocks. Fee-based earnings benefited from growth in assets under management to more than $9.5 billion. Spread-based institutional net operating earnings were up 18 percent related to the shift out of older, low margin contracts to new funding agreements. In addition, each period benefited from about $3 million of favorable investment items.
Fee-based sales grew 71 percent, driven by Lifetime Income Plus, a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit for life product that is part of the income distribution series
(2)
. Fee-based
 
 
third-party managed asset sales were up 70 percent, reflecting wholesaling and producer expansion. In spread-based retail, sales of single premium immediate annuities were $215 million, up 31 percent over the prior year. Fixed annuity sales declined 62 percent, reflecting the current interest rate and yield curve environment. Spread-based institutional sales of $379 million in the quarter included a $300 million registered notes offering.
 
Mortgage insurance segment net operating earnings were up 34 percent to $162 million. International mortgage insurance earnings grew 50 percent reflecting strength across leading positions in Canada, Australia and Europe. Earnings were up 46 percent in Canada from solid revenue growth and lower losses. In Australia, net operating earnings increased 40 percent from double-digit revenue growth, a lower effective tax rate and a $5 million adjustment to the unearned premium reserve. This more than offset higher losses associated with portfolio seasoning and increased delinquencies from a limited number of distribution relationships. Europe and new geographies contributed $4 million of net operating earnings versus zero in the prior year period, primarily from growth across Europe along with good loss performance.
International flow NIW increased 42 percent from account penetration in Europe, Australia and Canada. In Europe, flow NIW more than doubled to $4.5 billion from continued account
 
activation and penetration. Australian flow NIW increased 25 percent, reflecting strong mortgage origination growth from several key customers. In Canada, flow NIW increased 37 percent from customer penetration and growth in mortgage originations. Total NIW was flat due to higher bulk sales in the year ago quarter.
U.S. mortgage insurance earnings increased 18 percent to $72 million from insurance in force growth, $5 million lower expenses, $3 million higher investment income, and $2 million increase in reinsurance premium from agreements with the company's international operations. U.S. flow persistency was 71 percent in the quarter as higher interest rates slowed refinancing activity. Total losses decreased $1 million from both lower paid claims and a decline in delinquency counts, partially offset by higher reserves per delinquency.
U.S. flow NIW increased to $6.7 billion, reflecting continued penetration of new customer segments as well as growth in HomeOpeners sales, which reached $1.2 billion or 17 percent of flow production, nearly double the level a year ago. U.S. bulk NIW more than doubled to $1.5 billion reflecting participation in selected bulk transactions.
 
The Corporate and Other segment net operating loss was $31 million in the current quarter, $2 million higher than the prior year, primarily reflecting higher interest expense and lower tax benefits.
Other Items
Pretax second quarter net investment losses were $49 million, and $22 million net of taxes and other adjustments. Net investment losses resulted primarily from asset sales for portfolio repositioning activities.
 
During the quarter, Genworth repurchased 2.2 million shares at a weighted average price of $33.24. Genworth has the remaining authority to repurchase an additional $197 million, which it currently expects to complete by year-end.
Stockholders' equity as of June 30, 2006 was $12.2 billion, or $26.84 per share compared with $13.5 billion, or $28.69 per share as of June 30, 2005. Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, as of June 30, 2006 was $12.0 billion or $26.33 per share compared with $11.3 billion, or $24.10 per share as of June 30, 2005.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "net operating earnings." The company defines net operating earnings as net earnings excluding after-tax net investment gains (losses), which can fluctuate significantly from period to period, changes in accounting principles and infrequent or unusual non-operating items. There were no infrequent or unusual non-operating items excluded from net operating earnings for the periods presented in this press release.
Management believes that analysis of net operating earnings enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers. However, net operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. In addition, the company's definition of net operating earnings may differ from the definitions used by other companies. The table at the end of this press release includes a reconciliation of net earnings to net operating earnings.
Due to the unpredictable nature of the items excluded from the company's definition of net operating earnings, the company is unable to reconcile its outlook for net operating earnings to net earnings presented in accordance with GAAP.
During 2006, the company began allocating net investment gains (losses) to the operating segments in determining segment net earnings. The company excludes net investment gains (losses), net of taxes and other adjustments, from operating net earnings for each of the segments. Other adjustments represent amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other intangible assets associated with the net investment gains (losses). During 2005, all net investment gains (losses) were recorded in the Corporate and Other segment. For a reconciliation of segment net earnings to segment net operating earnings, see the company's second quarter 2006 financial supplement on the company's website at www.genworth.com or in the company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on July 27, 2006.
From time to time, the company also references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "operating return on equity" or "operating ROE." The company defines operating ROE as net operating earnings divided by average stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in average stockholders' equity. Management believes that analysis of operating ROE enhances understanding of the efficiency with which the company deploys its capital. However, operating ROE as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net earnings divided by average stockholders' equity. Due to the unpredictable nature of net earnings and average stockholders' equity excluding AOCI, the company is unable to reconcile its outlook for operating ROE to GAAP net earnings divided by average stockholders' equity.
Definition of Sales
The term "sales" as used in this press release means (1) annualized first-year premiums for term life insurance, long-term care insurance, Medicare supplement insurance and group life and health insurance; (2) new and additional premiums/deposits for universal life insurance, spread-based and
 
variable products; (3) new deposits for managed assets; (4) written premiums and deposits gross of ceded reinsurance and cancellations for payment protection insurance; (5) new insurance written for mortgage insurance, which in each case reflects the amount of business the company generated during each period presented; and (6) written premiums net of cancellations for our Mexican-domiciled operations. Sales do not include renewal premiums on policies or contracts written during prior periods. The company considers annualized first-year premiums, new premiums/deposits, written premiums and new insurance written to be a measure of the company's operating performance because they represent a measure of new sales of insurance policies or contracts during a specified period, rather than a measure of the company's revenues or profitability during that period. This operating measure enables the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as "expects," "intends," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "will," or words of similar meaning and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook for the company's future business and financial performance.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
This financial supplement includes the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "net operating earnings." The company defines net operating earnings as net earnings from continuing operations, excluding after-tax net investment gain (losses), net of taxes and other adjustments, changes in accounting principles and infrequent or unusual non-operating items. There were no infrequent or unusual non-operating items excluded from net operating earnings for the periods presented in this financial supplement.
Management believes that analysis of net operating earnings enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers. However, net operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. In addition, the company's definition of net operating earnings may differ from the definitions used by other companies. The table on page 7 of this report provides a reconciliation of net earnings to net operating earnings (as defined above) for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005.
During 2006, we began allocating net investment gains (losses) to the segments in determining segment net earnings. We exclude the net investment gains (losses), net of taxes and other adjustments, from segment net operating earnings for each of the segments. Other adjustments represent amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other intangible assets associated with the net investment gains (losses). During 2005, all net investment gains (losses) were recorded in the Corporate and Other segment.
This financial supplement includes other non-GAAP measures management believes enhances the understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers. These additional non-GAAP measures are on pages 46 through 50 of this financial supplement.

Non-GAAP Definition for Operating ROE
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "operating return on equity" or "operating ROE." The company defines operating ROE as net operating earnings divided by average stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in average stockholders' equity. Management believes that analysis of operating ROE enhances understanding of the efficiency with which the company deploys its capital. However, operating ROE as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net earnings divided by average stockholders' equity.

Non-GAAP Definition for Expense Ratio
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "expense ratio" as a measure of productivity. The company defines expense ratio as acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, divided by total revenues, excluding the effects of the company's payment protection insurance business. The payment protection insurance business is excluded from this ratio as its expense base is comprised of varying levels of non-deferrable acquisition costs. Management believes that the expense ratio analysis enhances understanding of the productivity of the company. However, the expense ratio as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, divided by total revenues.

Non-GAAP Definition for Core Premiums
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "core premiums" as a measure of premium growth. The company defines core premiums as earned premiums less premiums on a run-off block in our payment protection insurance business and less premiums from our spread-based retail business. The spread-based retail premiums are excluded in this measure primarily because these are single premiums and are not an indication of future premiums. Management believes that analysis of core premiums enhances understanding of premium growth of the company. However, core premiums as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP earned premiums.

Non-GAAP Definition for Core Yield

The company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for those items that are not recurring in nature. Management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company. However, core yield as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP investment yield.

Industry Ratings
Our principal life insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's and Fitch as follows:
 
Our mortgage insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P, Moody's and Fitch as follows:
 
The A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's and Fitch ratings are not designed to be, and do not serve as, measures of protection or valuation offered to investors. These financial strength ratings should not be relied on with respect to making an investment in our securities.
A.M. Best states that its A+'' (Superior) rating is assigned to those companies that have, in its opinion, a superior ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. The A+'' (Superior) rating is the second-highest of fifteen ratings assigned by A.M. Best, which range from A++'' to S''.
 
Table of Contents
 
Industry Ratings (continued)
Moody's states that insurance companies rated "Aa" (Excellent) offer excellent financial security. Moody's states that companies in this group constitute what are generally known as high-grade companies. The "Aa" range is the second-highest of nine financial strength rating ranges assigned by Moody's, which range from "Aaa" to "C." Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group, with 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest. Accordingly, the "Aa2" and "Aa3" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of Moody's 21 ratings categories. Short-term rating "P1" is the highest rating and shows superior ability for repayment of short-term debt obligations.
Fitch states that AA'' (Very Strong) rated insurance companies are viewed as possessing very strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. Risk factors are modest, and the impact of any adverse business and economic factors is expected to be very small. The AA'' rating category is the second-highest of eight financial strength rating categories, which range from AAA'' to D.'' The symbol (+) or (-) may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within a rating category. These suffixes are not added to ratings in the AAA'' category or to ratings below the CCC'' category. Accordingly, the AA'' and AA-'' ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of Fitch's 24 ratings categories.
Dominion Bond Rating states that long-term debt rated AA is of superior credit quality, and protection of interest and principal is considered high. In many cases they differ from long-term debt rated AAA only to a small degree. Given the extremely restrictive definition DBRS has for the AAA category, entities rated AA are also considered to be strong credits, typically exemplifying above-average strength in key areas of consideration and unlikely to be significantly affected by reasonably foreseeable events.
A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's, Fitch and Dominion Bond Rating review their ratings periodically and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current ratings in the future. Other agencies may also rate our company or our insurance subsidiaries on a solicited or an unsolicited basis.
On June 2, 2006, A.M. Best removed Continental Life Insurance Company of Brentwood, Tennessee from under review and upgraded the financial strength ratings to A- (excellent) from B++ (very good). The outlook for the rating is positive.
