Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 14, 2006, Genworth Financial, Inc. (the "Registrant") completed a public offering of $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Registrant's 6.15% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes due 2066 (the "Notes"). The Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of November 14, 2006 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 14, 2006 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), each between the Registrant and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Base Indenture, as so supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"). The Notes will bear interest on their principal amount from November 14, 2006 to but excluding November 15, 2016 at the annual rate of 6.15%, payable semi-annually in arrears, and from and including November 15, 2016 to but excluding November 15, 2066 at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 2.0025%, payable quarterly in arrears. The Notes are redeemable on November 15, 2036, or thereafter, to the extent sufficient proceeds are raised from the sale of certain replacement capital securities, or on November 15, 2066 if the Registrant is unable to raise such proceeds.
The Notes were issued pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated as of November 7, 2006, between the Registrant and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co., as underwriters (the "Underwriters"). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions expressed therein, the Registrant agreed to sell the Notes to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes for resale to the public. The Registrant sold the Notes to the Underwriters at an issue price of 98.712% of the principal amount thereof, and the Underwriters offered the Notes to the public at a price of 99.712% of the principal amount thereof. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $592 million. The Registrant intends to use approximately $319 million of the net proceeds to reduce its outstanding commercial paper borrowings and the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.
On November 14, 2006, in connection with the completion of the offering of the Notes, the Registrant entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant (the "Replacement Capital Covenant"), whereby the Registrant agreed for the benefit of holders of a specified series of the Registrant's long-term indebtedness ranking senior to the Notes that the Notes will not be repaid, redeemed or repurchased by the Registrant on or before November 15, 2046, unless such repayment, redemption or repurchase is made from the proceeds of the issuance of certain replacement capital securities and pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the Replacement Capital Covenant.
The Notes were offered and sold by the Registrant pursuant to its registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-138437).
The foregoing descriptions of the Indenture, the Replacement Capital Covenant and the Underwriting Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by

(g) To endeavor to qualify the Notes for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters shall reasonably request.

Expenses.
 
8. . The Underwriters covenant with the Company not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriters that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder but for the action of the Underwriters (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the final term sheet prepared by the Company and filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 6(k)). The Underwriters acknowledge and agree that, except as may be set forth in Schedule II hereto, the Company has not authorized or approved any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h)) for use in any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriters.
Covenants of the Underwriters
9. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, the preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, any Electronic Road Show or the Prospectus (if used within the period set forth in paragraph (f) of Section 6 hereof and as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Underwriters expressly for use therein.
Indemnity and Contribution.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally but not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the directors and officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, the preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any other free writing
 
prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriters on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any other free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 9(a) or 9(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Underwriters and all persons, if any who control any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, and (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons and affiliates of any Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or 9(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to under such paragraph, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) if the indemnifying party is the Company, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Notes, (ii) if the indemnifying person is an Underwriter, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such Underwriter on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or (iii) if the allocation provided by clause 9(d)(i)or 9(d)(ii) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 9(d)(i) above or the relative fault referred to in clause 9(d)(ii) but also the relative fault (in cases covered by clause 9(d)(i)) or such relative benefits (in cases covered by clause 9(d)(ii)) of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the
 
Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to the respective aggregate principal amount of Notes they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 9 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter, by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
10. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the Underwriters to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in the State of New York or the United States shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any material outbreak, or material escalation, of hostilities or other national or international
Termination
 
calamity or crisis, of such magnitude and severity in its effect on the financial markets of the United States, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters, as to prevent or materially impair the marketing, or enforcement of contracts for sale, of the Notes.
11. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Underwriters may specify, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Notes that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase on such date pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 11 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Notes without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes and the aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any one of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel)
 
reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
12. . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Counterparts
13. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.
Applicable Law
14. . The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.
Headings
15. . The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Notes: (a) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (b) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (c) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Notes.
Nature of Underwriters' Obligations
16. . This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Notes, represents the entire agreement between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, with respect to the preparation of the preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, and the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Notes.

EXHIBIT A-2
The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial or quantitative information, and many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus are of a non-legal character. In addition, we have not undertaken any obligation to verify independently any of the factual matters set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus. Consequently, in this letter we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus. Also, we do not make any statement herein with respect to any of the financial statements and related notes thereto, the financial statement schedules or the financial, statistical or accounting data contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus.
We have reviewed the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus and we have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company, its independent public accountants, its special insurance regulatory counsel, its local counsel, you and your counsel, at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and Prospectus and related matters were discussed.
Subject to the foregoing, we confirm to you that, on the basis of the information we gained in the course of performing the services referred to above, no facts have come to our attention which cause us to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, as of the effective date, or the Prospectus, as of its date, do not comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Rules and Regulations thereunder, (ii) the Registration Statement, as of the effective date thereof, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, (iii) the Time of Sale Prospectus, as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iv) the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Each subsidiary listed in Schedule A hereto (an ) has the necessary permits, licenses and authorizations under the insurance laws and regulations of the jurisdiction set forth opposite such Insurance Subsidiary's name on Schedule A hereto to conduct the lines of insurance business set forth opposite such Insurance Subsidiary's name on Schedule A hereto, except where the failure to have such permits, licenses or authorizations would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
"Insurance Subsidiary"
2.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.03 or of Section 3.05, unless the terms of a Global Security expressly permit such Global Security to be exchanged in whole or in part for individual Securities, a Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 3.05, only to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary for such Global Security, or to a successor Depositary for such Global Security selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary. None of the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
(c) (i) If at any time the Depositary for a Global Security notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities for the series represented by such Global Security shall no longer be eligible or in good standing under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Global Security. If a successor Depositary for such Global Security is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Company will execute a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Certificated Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security, and the Trustee, upon receipt of such Company Order, will authenticate and deliver Certificated Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security.

form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security.
(iii) The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depositary determine that the Securities of any series issued or issuable in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Certificated Securities of such series in exchange in whole or in part for such Global Security, will authenticate and deliver Certificated Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Security or Securities representing such series to be so exchanged for such Global Security or Securities.
(iv) If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to Securities issued or issuable in the form of a Global Security, the Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for Certificated Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (1) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Certificated Security or Securities of the same series of like tenor and terms and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (2) to such Depositary a new Global Security of like tenor and terms and in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Certificated Securities delivered to Holders thereof.

Section 3.03.
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its chairman of the Board of Directors, the vice chairman of the Board of Directors, a chief executive officer, its president or one of its vice presidents. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 2.01 and 3.01, or by one or more indentures supplemental hereto as provided by Section 9.01, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, if it so requests, and (subject to Section 6.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating:
 
(a) that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(b) that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(c) that this Indenture and such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and to general equity principles;
(d) that all laws and requirements in respect of the execution and delivery by the Company of the Securities have been complied with; and
(e) such other matters as the Trustee may reasonably request.
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication unless otherwise provided by the terms established and contemplated by Section 3.01.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual or facsimile signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 3.04Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
. Temporary Securities.
 
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
Section 3.05The Company shall cause to be kept at one of its offices or agencies maintained pursuant to Section 10.02 or at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office or in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to Section 2.03 and to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee initially is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided. The Company may act as Security Registrar and may change or appoint a Security Registrar without prior notice to Holders. If and so long as the Trustee is not the Security Register, the Trustee shall have the right to inspect the Security Register during normal business hours.
. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
Subject to Section 2.03, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor.
Subject to Section 2.03, at the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
Subject to Section 2.03, all Securities issued upon any registration or transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.03, 3.04, 9.04 or 11.07 not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption (under Section 11.03) and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
Section 3.06If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i)(A) any mutilated Security or (B) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for such mutilated Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 3.06, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section 3.06 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for such mutilated Security, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section 3.06 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 3.07Unless otherwise provided with respect to such Security by the terms established and contemplated by Section 3.01, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a special record date (a "Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at
 
the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, each Security lawfully delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Section 3.08Subject to Section 2.03, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.07) interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
. Persons Deemed Owners.
Section 3.09All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee shall destroy cancelled Securities and deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company.
. Cancellation.
 
Section 3.10Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for the Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
. Computation of Interest.
Section 3.11The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" and/or "ISIN" numbers (if then generally in use), and the Trustee shall use CUSIP or ISIN numbers, as the case may be, in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders and no representation shall be made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption, exchange or conversion. The Company will promptly notify, and in any event within 10 Business Days, the Trustee of any initial CUSIP and/or ISIN numbers and of any changes in the CUSIP and/or ISIN numbers.
. CUSIP and ISIN Numbers.

(5) any other Enforcement Event provided in or pursuant to the applicable Board Resolution or in the supplemental indenture under which such series of Securities is issued, as the case may be, as contemplated by Section 3.01.

If any Event of Default or Enforcement Event with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Trustee shall have no responsibility, including any right or obligation to exercise remedies, with respect to a default by the Company with respect to any covenant contained herein, other than a covenant the violation of which constitutes, or with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both, would constitute, an Event of Default or an Enforcement Event; provided, that nothing in this paragraph shall impair the right of the Trustee to enforce the Company's obligations hereunder with respect to the Trustee's compensation, reimbursement of expenses and advances and indemnities.

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.

. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
Section 5.11No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default or Enforcement Event shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or Enforcement Event or any acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
Section 5.12The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series (or if more than one series is affected thereby, of all series so affected, voting as a single class) shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided, however, that

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under this article cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default or Enforcement Event arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.14All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 5.14 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Securities on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).

An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company.

Section 10.03If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
. Money for Securities; Payments to Be Held in Trust.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look, only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the City, County and State of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such mailing or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
The Company shall have no obligation to make payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security in immediately available funds, except that if the Company shall have received original payment for Securities in immediately available funds it shall make available immediately available funds for payment of the principal of such Securities.

. Maintenance of Properties.
 
Section 10.06The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, a certificate of the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer of the Company stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signer thereof the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture, and if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge.

. Selection by Trustee of Securities to be Redeemed.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 11.04Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not such Holder receives the notice.

Section 11.05On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.03) an amount of money, in funds immediately available on the due date, sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date. Promptly after the calculation of the Redemption Price, the Company will give the Trustee and any Paying Agent written notice thereof.
. Deposit of Redemption Price.
Section 11.06Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified together with accrued interest thereon, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest.

The Trustee shall not redeem any Securities of any series pursuant to this Article (unless all Outstanding Securities of such series are to be redeemed) or mail or give any notice of redemption of Securities during the continuance of an Event of Default hereunder known to the Trustee with respect to such series, except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, , that it shall have received from the Company a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys theretofore or thereafter received by the Trustee shall, during the continuance of such Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article 5 and held for the payment of all such Securities of such series. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 5.13 or the default cured on or before the 60th day preceding the Redemption Date, such moneys shall thereafter be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
provided, however
Section 11.07Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.

Section 12.01The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of such series.
. Applicability of Article.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.02. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.
 
Section 12.02The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series; provided, however, that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
Section 12.03Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company (1) will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate (A) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured), (B) specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of Securities of that series, (C) stating whether or not the Company intends to exercise its right, if any, to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series on the next ensuing sinking fund payment date and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment and (D) specifying the portion of such sinking fund payment, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 12.02 and the basis for any such credit and (2) will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities of such series to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 11.03 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 11.04. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 11.05, 11.06 and 11.07. Failure of the Company, on or before any such 60th day, to deliver such Officers' Certificate and Securities specified in this Section, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Company (a) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (b) that the Company will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to Securities of such series as provided in this article.
. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
 
The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Security of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Securities of such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default with respect to such series except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Company a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article 5 and held for the payment of all such Securities of such series. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 5.13 or the default cured on or before the 60th day preceding the sinking fund payment date, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
Section 13.01The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of Securities issued hereunder by such Holder's acceptance thereof likewise covenants and agrees, that (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of any series) all Securities shall be issued subject to the provisions of this Article 13; and each Holder of a Security, whether upon original issue or upon transfer or assignment thereof, accepts and agrees to be bound by such provisions.
. Agreement to Subordinate. (a) 
(b) The payment by the Company of the principal of (and premium, if any), and interest on, the Securities issued hereunder shall, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding at the date of this Indenture or thereafter incurred.
(c) No provision of this article shall prevent the occurrence of any default or Event of Default or Enforcement Event hereunder.
Section 13.02 (a)No direct or indirect payment by or on behalf of the Company of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities (other than on Permitted Junior Securities), whether
. Default on Senior Indebtedness.
 
 
pursuant to the terms of the Securities or upon acceleration, by way of repurchase, redemption, defeasance or otherwise, will be made if, at the time of such payment, there exists a default in the payment when due of all or any portion of the obligations under or in respect of any Senior Indebtedness, whether at maturity, on account of mandatory redemption or prepayment, acceleration or otherwise, and such default shall not have been cured or waived or the benefits of this Section 13.02(a) waived by or on of the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
(b) In addition, during the continuance of any non-payment default or non-payment event of default with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated, and upon receipt by the Trustee of written notice (a "Payment Blockage Notice") from a holder or holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the trustee or agent acting on behalf of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, then, unless and until such default or event of default has been cured or waived or has ceased to exist or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash, or the requisite holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness have otherwise agreed in writing, (a) no payment of any kind or character with respect to any principal of or interest on or distribution will be made by or on behalf of the Company on account of or with respect to the Securities (other than in Permitted Junior Securities) and (b) the Company may not acquire any Securities for cash, property or otherwise, during a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing on the date of receipt of such Payment Blockage Notice by the Trustee and ending 179 days thereafter.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) in no event will a Payment Blockage Period extend beyond 179 days from the date the Payment Blockage Notice in respect thereof was given. Not more than one Payment Blockage Period may be commenced with respect to the Securities during any period of 360 consecutive days. No default or event of default that existed or was continuing on the date of commencement of any Payment Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness initiating such Payment Blockage Period may be, or be made, the basis for the commencement of any other Payment Blockage Period by the holder or holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the trustee or agent acting on behalf of such Designated Senior Indebtedness, whether or not within a period of 360 consecutive days, unless such default or event of default has been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.

(ii) The Company shall (A) not later than the Business Day immediately following the first Interest Payment Date during a Deferral Period on which the Company elects to pay current interest or, if earlier, the Business Day following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the relevant Deferral Period, be required to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Qualifying Securities pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism, subject to the Warrant Issuance Cap, the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap and the Share Cap, and unless the Company has delivered to the Trustee notice of a Market Disruption Event, to apply the Eligible Proceeds to the payment of any deferred interest (and Additional Interest thereon) on the next Interest Payment Date, and this requirement shall continue in effect until the end of the Deferral Period; and (B) not pay deferred interest on the Notes (and Additional Interest thereon) prior to the Final Maturity Date from any source other than Eligible Proceeds unless otherwise required at the time by any applicable regulatory authority, although it may pay current interest at all times from any available funds. The Company's failure to pay interest on the Notes in accordance with the Alternative Payment Mechanism as required by this Supplemental Indenture shall constitute a default under clause (5) of the definition of Enforcement Event in the Indenture, but shall in no event constitute an Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall have no obligation to exercise any remedies with respect to any Enforcement Event
 
arising from such default unless directed to do so in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 5.12 and 6.02(4) of the Indenture. The Trustee may conclusively assume that the Alternative Payment Mechanism has been complied with unless the Company or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes have given the Trustee notice to the contrary.
(iii) If the Company is involved in a business combination where immediately after its consummation more than 50% of the surviving entity's voting stock is owned by the shareholders of the other party to the business combination, then the Alternative Payment Mechanism shall not apply to any interest that is deferred and unpaid as of the date of consummation of the business combination. The Alternative Payment Mechanism shall apply, however, to any interest on the Notes that is deferred after such date.
(iv) To the extent that the Company applies proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Securities to pay interest, the Company shall allocate the proceeds to deferred payments of interest (and Additional Interest thereon) in chronological order based on the date each payment was first deferred.
(v) At the end of a 10-year Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest. After the Company makes all interest payments that the Company has deferred, including Additional Interest on the deferred payments, the Company may again defer interest payments during new Deferral Periods of up to 10 years, subject to the requirements therefor set forth herein.
(vi) The Company shall give the Holders of the Notes and the Trustee written notice of its election to begin a Deferral Period at least one Business Day before the Regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on which such Deferral Period shall begin. However, the Company's failure to pay interest on an Interest Payment Date shall constitute the commencement of a Deferral Period unless the Company pays such interest within five Business Days of the Interest Payment Date, whether or not it provides a notice of deferral. For the avoidance of doubt, the non-payment of such interest for five Business Days does not give rise to a default under the Indenture.
(vii) So long as any Notes remain Outstanding during any Deferral Period, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to declare or pay any dividends or any Distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment on, any shares of the Company's capital stock or make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any of the
 
Company's debt securities that rank with or junior to the Notes. However, at any time, including during any Deferral Period, the Company shall be permitted to: (A) pay dividends or Distributions to common shareholders in the form of additional shares of Common Stock; (B) declare or pay a dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders' rights plan, or issue stock under such a plan, or redeem or repurchase any rights distributed pursuant to such a plan and (C) purchase Common Stock for issuance pursuant to any employee benefit plans. In addition, if any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, the Company shall not, subject to the limited exceptions set forth in this Section 2.01(g)(vii) and unless required to do so by any applicable regulatory authority, repurchase, or permit its Subsidiaries to purchase, Common Stock for a one-year period following the date on which all deferred interest has been paid pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism. If the Company is involved in a business combination where immediately after its consummation more than 50% of the surviving entity's voting stock is owned by the shareholders of the other party to the business combination, then the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to any Deferral Period that is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of the business combination.
pari passu
(h) . (i) Subject to certain conditions described in Section 2.01(h)(ii) and the exception described in Section 2.01(h)(iv) below, if the Company defers interest on the Notes, it shall be required, not later than (i) the Business Day immediately following the first Interest Payment Date during a Deferral Period on which it elects to pay current interest, or (ii) if earlier, the Business Day following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period, to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to begin issuing Qualifying Securities to Persons that are not its Affiliates. The Company shall be required, with respect to any subsequent Interest Payment Date during a Deferral Period until the deferred interest has been paid in full, to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Qualifying Securities until the Company has raised an amount of Eligible Proceeds that is sufficient to pay all deferred interest (and Additional Interest thereon) accrued up to such Interest Payment Date. The Company shall not pay deferred interest (and Additional Interest thereon) on the Notes prior to the Final Maturity Date from any source other than Eligible Proceeds, unless otherwise required at the time by any applicable regulatory authority. This method of funding the payment of accrued and unpaid interest is referred to as the ""
Alternative Payment Mechanism
Alternative Payment Mechanism.
(ii) Under the Alternative Payment Mechanism, the Company shall not issue Qualifying Warrants for the purposes of the Alternative Payment Mechanism prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of any Deferral Period to the extent that the number of shares of Common Stock underlying any issuance of Qualifying Warrants applied to pay deferred interest on the Notes, together with the number of shares
 
underlying all prior issuances of Qualifying Warrants during such Deferral Period so applied, would exceed 2% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Company's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements (the ""). In addition, the Company shall not issue Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock for the purposes of the Alternative Payment Mechanism to the extent that the net proceeds of any issuance of Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock applied to pay deferred interest on the Notes, together with the net proceeds of all prior issuances of Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock so applied, would exceed 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes Outstanding as of November 15, 2006 (the ""). Once the Company reaches the Warrant Issuance Cap for any Deferral Period, it may not issue more Qualifying Warrants prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Deferral Period pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism even if there is a subsequent increase in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Warrant Issuance Cap shall cease to apply following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of any Deferral Period, at which point the Company may only pay any deferred interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred (other than on the Final Maturity Date), using the Alternative Payment Mechanism, subject to the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, the Share Cap and any Market Disruption Event. If the Warrant Issuance Cap has been reached during a Deferral Period and the Company subsequently pays all deferred payments (and Additional Interest thereon), the Warrant Issuance Cap shall cease to apply, and shall only apply again once the Company starts a new Deferral Period. The Preferred Stock Issuance Cap shall apply so long as the Notes remain Outstanding and all proceeds of issuances of Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock used to pay deferred interest hereunder shall count against such cap. The Company shall not issue Qualifying Warrants for the purposes of the Alternative Payment Mechanism to the extent that the total number of shares of Common Stock underlying such Qualifying Warrants, together with all prior issuances of Qualifying Warrants, exceeds 50 million shares (the ""). The Share Cap shall apply so long as the Notes remain Outstanding, other than on the Final Maturity Date. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to increase the Share Cap from time to time (without having to comply with Article 9 of the Indenture) to a number of shares of Common Stock that would allow it to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Alternative Payment Mechanism by delivering to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the increased Share Cap. The Share Cap shall be adjusted proportionately for any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, effective upon the effective date of any such transaction.
Warrant Issuance Cap
Preferred Stock Issuance Cap
Share Cap
 
(iii) If, due to a Market Disruption Event or otherwise, the Company were able to raise some, but not all, Eligible Proceeds necessary to pay all deferred interest (including Additional Interest thereon) on any Interest Payment Date, the Company shall apply any available Eligible Proceeds to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date in chronological order. If the Company shall have outstanding securities in addition to, and that rank with, the Notes under which the Company is obligated to sell Qualifying Securities and apply the net proceeds to the payment of deferred interest or Distributions and the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to such effect, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from those sales and available for payment of the deferred interest and Distributions shall be applied to the Notes and those other securities on a basis in accordance with their respective outstanding principal amounts, or on such other basis as any applicable regulator shall approve.
pari passu
pro rata
(iv) The Company shall be relieved of its obligations under the Alternative Payment Mechanism in respect of any Interest Payment Date if it delivers an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee (which the Trustee shall promptly forward upon receipt to each Holder of the Notes) no more than 30 and no less than 15 days in advance of that Interest Payment Date certifying that a Market Disruption Event was existing after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date; and either:
(1) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such certification is provided; or
(2) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of this period, but the Company was unable after using Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid interest.
"" to sell securities in accordance with the Alternative Payment Mechanism means commercially reasonable efforts to complete the offer and sale of Qualifying Securities to third parties that are not Subsidiaries of the Company in public offerings or private placements. The Company shall not be relieved of its obligations under the Alternative Payment Mechanism if it determines not to pursue or complete the sale of Qualifying Securities due to pricing, dividend rate or dilution considerations.
Commercially Reasonable Efforts
 
(i) . Clauses (1) through (4) of Section 5.01 of the Indenture shall constitute Events of Default with respect to the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture, no breach by the Company of any other covenant or obligation under the Indenture, this Supplemental Indenture or the terms of the Notes shall be an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
Events of Default

(i) Subject to obtaining any then-required regulatory approval, the Notes are redeemable (A) in whole or in part, at any time on or after November 15, 2016 at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, that in the event of a redemption in part that the principal amount outstanding after such redemption is at least $50,000,000; (B) in whole or in part, prior to November 15, 2016, in cases not involving a Tax Event or Rating Agency Event, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, the Make-Whole Price, that in the event of a redemption in part the principal amount outstanding after such redemption is at least $50,000,000; and (C) in whole, but not in part, prior to November 15, 2016, within 90 days after the occurrence of a Tax Event or Rating Agency Event, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, the Special Event Make-Whole Price.
