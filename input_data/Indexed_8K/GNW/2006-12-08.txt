Item 8.01. Other Events.
On December 8, 2006, the Board of Directors of Genworth Financial, Inc. (the "Company") approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock over the 12-month period commencing January 1, 2007. The Company expects the purchases to be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise (including, without limitation, using so-called Rule 10b5-1 plans), or in privately negotiated transactions.
The timing of the share repurchases under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Common stock acquired through the repurchase program will be held as treasury shares and may be used for general corporate purposes, including reissuances in connection with acquisitions, employee stock option exercises or other employee stock plans.
