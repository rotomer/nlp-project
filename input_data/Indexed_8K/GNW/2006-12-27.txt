Exhibit 99.1
Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd
 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd.:
We have audited the accompanying statements of financial position of Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd. as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related statements of earnings, changes in stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards as established by the Auditing Standards Board (United States) and in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

(1) Nature of Business, Formation of Genworth Mortgage and Basis of Presentation
Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd ("Genworth Mortgage" or "the Company" as appropriate) offers mortgage insurance products in Australia and New Zealand and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. In particular, the Company offers primary mortgage insurance, known as "lenders mortgage insurance," or LMI, and portfolio credit enhancement policies. The principal product is LMI, which is generally single premium business and provides 100% coverage of the loan amount in the event of a mortgage default.
The Company's management has determined that the Company has one reportable operating segment, mortgage insurance.
Genworth Mortgage, formerly GE Mortgage Insurance Company Pty Ltd, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Holdings Pty Ltd and was incorporated in Australia on November 10, 2003. The ultimate parent company of Genworth Mortgage is Genworth Financial, Inc. ("Genworth"). Genworth is a company incorporated in Delaware on October 23, 2003. GE Mortgage Insurance Company Pty Ltd changed its name to Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd on November 28, 2005.
Genworth was formed in preparation for the corporate reorganization of certain insurance and related subsidiaries of the General Electric Company ("GE") and an initial public offering of Genworth common stock, completed on May 28, 2004 ("IPO"). As part of that corporate reorganization, Genworth Mortgage was party to a transfer agreement whereby it acquired all of the insurance assets and liabilities of GE Capital Mortgage Insurance Corporation (Australia) Pty Ltd and GE Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd ("Predecessor Companies") following the approval of an application, by the Company, to the Federal Court of Australia in February 2004. The assets and liabilities were accounted for at book value as transfers between entities under common control.
The financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. They include the consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor Companies for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the three months ended March 31, 2004 prior to the transfer of the business to Genworth Mortgage. In relation to the Predecessor Companies, GE Capital Mortgage Insurance Corporation (Australia) Pty Ltd was a wholly owned subsidiary of GE Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
For periods prior to this corporate reorganization, the accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the above named Predecessor Companies. For these periods, we refer to the consolidated Predecessor Companies as the "Predecessor Companies", unless the context otherwise requires.
For periods subsequent to the reorganization, the accompanying financial statements include the accounts of Genworth Mortgage, which for these periods we refer to as the "Company" unless the context otherwise requires.
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
(2) Significant Accounting Policies
a) Premiums
Single premium is usually collected from prospective borrowers by the lenders at the time the loan proceeds are advanced, and remitted to Genworth Mortgage as the mortgage insurer. The proceeds are recorded to
 
 
unearned premium reserves and recognized as premiums earned over the estimated policy life in accordance with the expected expiration of risk. This is further described in the accounting policy for unearned premiums.
b) Net Investment Income and Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses
Investment income is recognized when earned. Realized investment gains and losses are calculated on the basis of specific identification. The cost of investments for the determination of realized investment gains and losses is the amount paid when the security was originally purchased adjusted for amortization and accretion.
c) Other Income
Other income consists primarily of management fees for services provided by the Company for the management of insurance portfolios held by third party insurance companies. Such services include accounting, claims management, IT systems maintenance, portfolio analytics and management reporting. These fees are recorded as revenue when the related service is provided.
d) Fixed Maturity Investments
Investment securities have been designated as available-for-sale and are reported in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value. Values for securities are obtained from external pricing services. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments, net of deferred income taxes, are reflected as unrealized investment gains or losses in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
The Company regularly reviews investment securities for impairment in accordance with its impairment policy, which includes both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria include length of time and amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position and whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security. Qualitative criteria include the financial strength and specific prospects for the issuer as well as the Company's intent to hold the security until recovery. Securities that are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired are recognized as a charge to realized investment gains (losses) in the period in which such determination is made.
e) Cash and Cash Equivalents
Certificates of deposit, money market funds, and other time deposits with original maturities of less than three months are considered cash equivalents in the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows. Items with maturities greater than three months but less than one year at the time of acquisition are short-term investments and are included as part of fixed maturities. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, short-term investments amounted to $16 million and $28 million, respectively.
f) Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC)
Acquisition costs include costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance. Acquisition costs include those costs incurred in the acquisition, underwriting and processing of new business including solicitation and printing costs, sales material and, some support costs such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses. Such costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms of the underlying policies.
The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.97,
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses
 
 
, guidance on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. Amortization of these costs relating to each underwriting year is charged against revenue over time in accordance with the estimated expiration of risk.
from the Sale of Investments
The Company reviews all assumptions underlying DAC and tests DAC for recoverability annually. All the policies written by the Company are single premium. If the balance of unearned premium plus interest earnings, is less than the current estimate of future losses and expenses (including any unamortized DAC), a charge to income is recorded for additional DAC amortization. For the periods ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 no charges to income were recorded as a result of DAC recoverability testing.
g) Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and judgment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. An impairment charge is recognized for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its fair value. Discounted cash flows are used to establish fair values. For the periods ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, no charges were recorded as a result of goodwill impairment testing.
h) Reinsurance
Premium revenue, benefits, and operating expenses are reported net of the amounts relating to reinsurance ceded to other companies. Amounts due from reinsurers for incurred and estimated future claims are reflected in the reinsurance recoverable asset. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the related treaties using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying reinsured policies.
i) Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
The reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents the amount needed to provide for the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the end of the respective reporting period. The estimated liability includes requirements for future payments of (a) claims that have been reported to the Company, (b) claims related to insured events that have occurred but that have not been reported to the Company as of the date the liability is estimated, and (c) claim adjustment expenses. Claim adjustment expenses include costs incurred in the claim settlement process such as legal fees and costs to record, process, and adjust claims.
Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on notices of mortgage loan defaults and estimates of defaults that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, using assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans that result in a claim. As is common accounting practice in the mortgage insurance industry and in accordance with GAAP, loss reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default.
Management considers the liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses provided to be satisfactory to cover the losses that have occurred. Management monitors actual experience, and where circumstances warrant, will revise its assumptions. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing the reserves are reviewed annually and any adjustments are reflected in operations in the period in which they become known. Future developments may result in losses and loss expenses greater or less than the liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses provided.
 
 
j) Unearned Premiums
For single premium insurance contracts, a portion of the revenue is recognized as premiums earned in the current period, while the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums and earned over time in accordance with the estimated expiration of risk. If single premium policies are canceled and the premium is non-refundable, then the remaining unearned premium related to each cancelled policy is recognized as earned premiums upon notification of the cancellation. Estimation of risk expiration for the recognition of premium is inherently judgmental and is based on actuarial analysis of historical experience. The premium earnings recognition model is reviewed periodically with any adjustments to the estimates reflected in current period earnings. As a result of the reviews conducted, there was a release of $4 million to earnings in 2004. There was no release in 2003 or 2005.
k) Income Taxes
For periods prior to the corporate reorganization, the predecessor companies were included in the consolidated Australian income tax return of GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd, an indirect subsidiary of GE, and subject to a tax-sharing arrangement that allocated tax on a separate company basis and provided benefit for current utilization of losses and credits. Intercompany balances under all agreements were settled at least annually.
Effective May 21, 2004, Genworth Mortgage is included in a consolidated Australian income tax return of Genworth with its Australian parent company and, subject to a tax-sharing arrangement that allocates tax on a separate company basis and provides benefit for current utilization of losses and credits.
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are estimated based on the Company's assessment of the realizability of such amounts.
Accounting for Income Taxes.
l) Foreign Currency Translation
The local currency, the Australian dollar, is the functional currency for the Company. The determination of the functional currency is made based on the appropriate economic and management indicators. The financial statements have been translated into U.S dollars (the "reporting currency") in accordance with SFAS No. 52, . Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the Statement of Financial Position date or historical rates. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S dollars at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from this currency re-measurement are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in the Statement of Changes in Stockholder's Equity.
Foreign Currency Translation
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of foreign receivables or payables, are included in the statement of earnings.
m) Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted
The Company adopted FASB Interpretation 46 ("FIN 46R"), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities on July 1, 2003. FIN 46R represents a significant change in accounting principles governing consolidation of off
 
 
balance sheet arrangements. One of the most common forms of off-balance sheet arrangements is asset securitization. Refer note 13 for details of the Company's transactions with conduits that are sponsored by third parties. There is no consolidation of those conduits in the financial statements of the Company.
On November 5, 2005, FASB Staff issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") Nos. 115-1 and 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments ("FSP Nos. 115-1 and 124-1"). FSP 115-1 and 124-1 address the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in this FSP shall be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. Adoption of FSP Nos. 115-1 and 124-1 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position.
n) Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In September 2005, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1, This statement provides guidance on accounting for deferred acquisition costs and other deferred balances on an internal replacement, defined broadly as a modification in product benefits, features, rights, or coverages that occurs by the exchange of an existing contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to an existing contract, or by the election of a benefit, feature, right, or coverage within an existing contract. Depending on the type of modification, the period over which these deferred balances will be recognized could be accelerated. SOP 05-1 is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact SOP 05-1 will have on its results of operations and financial position.
Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts.
As of January 1, 2006 the Company adopted SFAS No. 155, ""("SFAS 155"). SFAS 155 amends SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140, " ("SFAS 140"). SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole, eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host, if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. In addition, among other changes, SFAS 155 (i) clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133; (ii) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; (iii) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and (iv) eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying special- purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial interest. Adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities"
In July 2006, FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, was issued. This guidance clarifies what criteria must be met prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit of a position taken in a tax return. Additionally, it applies to the recognition and measurement of income tax uncertainties resulting from a purchase business combination. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact FIN No. 48 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
 
 
(3) Investments
(a) Net Investment Income
For the years ended December 31, sources of net investment income are as follows:
 
(b) Realized Investment Gains (Losses)
For the years ended December 31, gross realized investment gains and losses resulting from the sales of fixed maturity securities are as follows:
 
(c) Unrealized Gains (Losses)
Net unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities classified as available for sale are reduced by deferred income taxes that would have resulted had such gains and losses been realized. Net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities reflected as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, are summarized as follows:
 
 
 
The net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities reported in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, are as follows:
 
(d) Fixed Maturities
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the amortized cost or cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and estimated fair value of our fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are as follows:
 
 
For fixed maturities, an impairment charge is recognized in earnings in the period in which the Company determines that it does not expect either to collect principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the instruments or to recover based upon underlying collateral values, considering events such as a payment default, bankruptcy or disclosure of fraud. Impairment charges are measured as the difference between the book value of a security and its fair value. There were no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
We generally intend to hold securities in unrealized loss positions until they recover. However, from time to time, we sell securities in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio to meet diversification, credit quality,
 
 
yield and liquidity requirements. The aggregate fair value of securities sold at a loss during twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was $159 million, which was 98.9% of book value.
The following table presents the gross unrealized losses and estimated fair values of investment securities, aggregated by investment type and length of time that individual investment securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, as of December 31, 2005:
 
The investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2005 consist of 82 securities with gross unrealized losses of $5 million. Of these unrealized losses 100% are investment grade (rated AAA through BBB-) and 100% are less than 20% below cost. The amount of the unrealized loss on these securities is primarily attributable to increases in interest rates.
As these investments are expected to continue to perform as to their original contractual terms and the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investment securities until the recovery of the fair value up to the cost of the investment, which may be maturity, it does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2005.
 
 
The following table presents the gross unrealized losses and estimated fair values of investment securities, aggregated by investment type and length of time that individual investment securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, as of December 31, 2004:
 
The scheduled maturity distribution of fixed maturities as of December 31, 2005 is set forth below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers of securities may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties
.
 
As of December 31, 2005, $150 million of investments are subject to certain call provisions. Typically, call provisions provide the issuer the ability to redeem a security, prior to its stated maturity, at or above par.
(e) Investment Concentrations
As of December 31, 2005, securities issued by finance and insurance industry groups and foreign state government represented approximately 75% and 20% respectively of the corporate fixed maturities portfolio held by the Company.
 
 
As of December 31, 2005, the Company held $55 million in corporate fixed maturity securities issued by the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group, $80 million issued by the New South Wales Treasury Corporation and $50 million issued by the Queensland Treasury Corporation. These holdings comprised 11%, 15% and 10% of total stockholder's equity respectively. No other single issuer exceeded 10% of total stockholder's equity.
(4) Deferred Acquisition Costs
Activity impacting deferred acquisition costs for the years ended December 31:
 
(5) Goodwill
There were no additions or impairments to goodwill during the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The movement in goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2005 arises from adjustments for foreign currency translation.
(6) Reinsurance
The Company has assumed mortgage insurance business from Westpac Banking Corporation. The contract provides reinsurance on the basis of a 30% quota share.
Prior to the corporate reorganization, the predecessor companies were party to excess of loss contracts with an affiliate of GE. In these contracts the predecessor companies ceded business to the affiliate.
After the corporate reorganization, the contracts were transferred to a new reinsurance agreement with Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation, an affiliate company. The contracts provide for the recoverability of losses in excess of an annually determined limit that is based on the Company's net earned premiums.
The Company utilizes reinsurance as a risk management tool but recognizes that reinsurance contracts do not relieve it from its obligations to policyholders. In the event that the reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations, the Company remains liable for the reinsured claims. The Company monitors both the financial condition of individual reinsurers and risk concentrations arising from similar geographic regions, activities and economic characteristics of reinsurers to lessen the risk of default by such reinsurers. Other than with Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation, the Company does not have significant concentrations of reinsurance with any one reinsurer that could have a material impact on its results of operations.
 
 
The following table sets forth the effects of reinsurance on premiums written and earned for the years ended December 31:
 
Reinsurance recoveries recognized as a reduction of losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoveries recognized as a reduction to changes in the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses were not significant during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(7) Reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses
The following table sets forth changes in the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the years ended December 31:
 
 
 
There were no reinsurance recoveries during the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003. For each of the three years presented above, the change in prior years incurred liabilities primarily relates to favorable development in claims incurred but not reported. This is due to strong housing appreciation and favorable economic conditions experienced in Australia during the three-year period.
(8) Employee Benefit Plans
It is compulsory for superannuation contributions to be made by the Company to a regulated and complying superannuation fund for all Australian employees. Superannuation funds are defined contribution plans. The minimum required contribution, based on an employee's salary, which is paid by the Company, is 9% in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Employees may elect to pay additional contributions out of their salary. The default superannuation plan for Australian employees prior to the corporate re-organization was the General Electric Australia Superannuation Plan. The default superannuation plan for Australian employees after the corporate re-organization is the BT Lifetime Super  Employer Plan. Employees may elect for the contributions relating to them to be paid into another plan. The Company has made superannuation payments on behalf of their employees of $0.9 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively.
(9) Income Taxes
The total provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31:
 
The reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows:
 
The components of the net deferred income tax asset as of December 31 are as follows:
 
 
 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at December 31, 2005. Accordingly, no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has been established.
All but an insignificant amount of earnings before income taxes comes from domestic sources.
(10) Related Party Transactions
GE provided a variety of products and services to the Company and predecessor companies pre and post IPO. The services received from GE included:
 
 
 
 
 
The total expense for these services was $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In addition, the Company and predecessor companies have recorded an amount for an allocated share of Genworth's and GE's corporate overhead for certain services. These costs have not been specifically billed to the Company or the predecessor companies and have been treated as a contribution of capital, where the debt was not settled ($2.1 million and $1.6 million in 2003 and 2004 respectively). They include allocations of costs for public relations, investor relations and, internal audit services in the amount of $7.3 million, $5.8 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively.
The Company has also recorded expenses associated with GE stock option, Genworth stock option and restricted stock unit grants in the amount of $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively.
The Company has a reinsurance arrangement with Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation, an affiliate. Refer to note 6.
The Company distributes mortgage insurance, in part, through arrangements with GE Money Australia and New Zealand. GE Money acquired Australian Financial Investments Group on October 27, 2004. The Company received gross written premiums of $37.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 and $2.4 million during the period from October 27, 2004 to December 31, 2004.
 
 
(11) Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Assets and liabilities that are reflected in the accompanying financial statements at fair value are not included in the following disclosure of fair value; such items include cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale. Other financial assets and liabilitiesthose not carried at fair valueare discussed below.
Fair value is estimated based on carrying value, which approximates fair value.
The following represents the fair value of financial liabilities as of December 31:
 
 
(12) Supplemental Cash Flow Information
Net cash paid for taxes is $27 million, $20 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(13) Securitization Entities
Part of the Company's product offering includes portfolio credit enhancement policies to Australian regulated lenders that have originated housing loans for securitization in the Australian, European and U.S. markets. Portfolio mortgage insurance serves as an important form of credit enhancement for the Australian securitization market and the Company's portfolio credit enhancement coverage is generally purchased for low loan-to-value, seasoned loans written by regulated institutions.
As at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had a maximum exposure to loss from the provision of portfolio credit enhancement to securitization trusts sponsored by third parties of $303 million and $252 million respectively. This exposure is calculated based on the expectation of a 1 in 250 year event. We have applied the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority stress scenario to calculate this exposure. The Company holds sufficient capital resources to meet this obligation were it to occur.
The Company does not consider that a significant adverse effect is likely to occur.
(14) Statutory Accounting
Genworth Mortgage prepares financial statements for its regulator, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, ("APRA"), in accordance with the accounting practices prescribed by the regulator, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP. The main differences are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
The Company's APRA net income after tax, capital base, minimum capital requirement and solvency ratio as of, and for the years ended are as follows:
 
Under the insurance laws of Australia, mortgage insurers are required to establish a catastrophic risk charge defined as a 1 in 250 year event. The Company is required to maintain adequate capital to fund this charge, in addition to normal insurance liabilities, by ensuring that its capital base exceeds its minimum capital requirement at all times.
The Company's ability to pay dividends to Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Holdings Pty Ltd is restricted to the extent the payment of dividends exceeds current year earnings. Any dividend above this level requires approval from APRA.
(15) Subsequent events
On May 31, 2006 the Company agreed to acquire Vero Lenders Mortgage Insurance Limited for $165 million. The transaction was approved by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission. The acquisition was closed on July 3, 2006.

(1) Nature of Business, Formation of Genworth Mortgage and Basis of Presentation
Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd ("Genworth Mortgage" or "the Company" as appropriate) offers mortgage insurance products in Australia and New Zealand and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. In particular, the Company offers primary mortgage insurance, known as "lenders mortgage insurance," or LMI, and portfolio credit enhancement policies. The principal product is LMI, which is generally single premium business and provides 100% coverage of the loan amount in the event of a mortgage default.
On May 31, 2006 the Company agreed to acquire Vero Lenders Mortgage Insurance Limited for $165 million. The transaction was approved by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission. The acquisition was closed on July 3, 2006.
The Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and disclosure requirements for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
(2) Significant Accounting Policies
a) Premiums
Single premium is usually collected from prospective borrowers by the lenders at the time the loan proceeds are advanced, and remitted to Genworth Mortgage as the mortgage insurer. The proceeds are recorded to unearned premium reserves and recognized as premiums earned over the estimated policy life in accordance with the expected expiration of risk. This is further described in the accounting policy for unearned premiums.
b) Net Investment Income and Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses
Investment income is recognized when earned. Realized investment gains and losses are calculated on the basis of specific identification. The cost of investments for the determination of realized investment gains and losses is the amount paid when the security was originally purchased adjusted for amortization and accretion.
c) Other Income
Other income consists primarily of management fees for services provided by the Company for the management of insurance portfolios held by third party insurance companies. Such services include accounting, claims management, IT systems maintenance, portfolio analytics and management reporting. These fees are recorded as revenue when the related service is provided.
 
 
d) Fixed Maturity Investments
Investment securities have been designated as available-for-sale and are reported in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value. Values for securities are obtained from external pricing services. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments, net of deferred income taxes, are reflected as unrealized investment gains or losses in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
The Company regularly reviews investment securities for impairment in accordance with its impairment policy, which includes both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Quantitative criteria include length of time and amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position and whether the issuer is in compliance with terms and covenants of the security. Qualitative criteria include the financial strength and specific prospects for the issuer as well as the Company's intent to hold the security until recovery. Securities that are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired are recognized as a charge to realized investment gains (losses) in the period in which such determination is made.
e) Cash and Cash Equivalents
Certificates of deposit, money market funds, and other time deposits with original maturities of less than three months are considered cash equivalents in the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows. Items with maturities greater than three months but less than one year at the time of acquisition are short-term investments and are included as part of fixed maturities. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, short-term investments amounted to $16 million and $28 million, respectively.
f) Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC)
Acquisition costs include costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance. Acquisition costs include those costs incurred in the acquisition, underwriting and processing of new business including solicitation and printing costs, sales material and, some support costs such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses. Such costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the terms of the underlying policies.
The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 97, , guidance on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. Amortization of these costs relating to each underwriting year is charged against revenue over time in accordance with the estimated expiration of risk.
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments
The Company reviews all assumptions underlying DAC and tests DAC for recoverability annually. All the policies written by the Company are single premium. If the balance of unearned premium plus interest earnings, is less than the current estimate of future losses and expenses (including any unamortized DAC), a charge to income is recorded for additional DAC amortization. For the periods ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 no charges to income were recorded as a result of DAC recoverability testing.
g) Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and judgment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the operating segment
 
 
or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. An impairment charge is recognized for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its fair value. Discounted cash flows are used to establish fair values. For the periods ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, no charges were recorded as a result of goodwill impairment testing.
h) Reinsurance
Premium revenue, benefits, and operating expenses are reported net of the amounts relating to reinsurance ceded to other companies. Amounts due from reinsurers for incurred and estimated future claims are reflected in the reinsurance recoverable asset. The cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the related treaties using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying reinsured policies.
i) Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
The reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents the amount needed to provide for the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the end of the respective reporting period. The estimated liability includes requirements for future payments of (a) claims that have been reported to the Company, (b) claims related to insured events that have occurred but that have not been reported to the Company as of the date the liability is estimated, and (c) claim adjustment expenses. Claim adjustment expenses include costs incurred in the claim settlement process such as legal fees and costs to record, process, and adjust claims.
Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on notices of mortgage loan defaults and estimates of defaults that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers, using assumptions of claim rates for loans in default and the average amount paid for loans that result in a claim. As is common accounting practice in the mortgage insurance industry and in accordance with GAAP, loss reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default.
Management considers the liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses provided to be satisfactory to cover the losses that have occurred. Management monitors actual experience, and where circumstances warrant, will revise its assumptions. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing the reserves are reviewed annually and any adjustments are reflected in operations in the period in which they become known. Future developments may result in losses and loss expenses greater or less than the liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses provided.
j) Unearned Premiums
For single premium insurance contracts, a portion of the revenue is recognized as premiums earned in the current period, while the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums and earned over time in accordance with the estimated expiration of risk. If single premium policies are canceled and the premium is non-refundable, then the remaining unearned premium related to each cancelled policy is recognized as earned premiums upon notification of the cancellation. Estimation of risk expiration for the recognition of premium is inherently judgmental and is based on actuarial analysis of historical experience. The premium earnings recognition model
 
 
is reviewed periodically with any adjustments to the estimates reflected in current period earnings. As a result of the reviews conducted, there was a release of $4 million to earnings in 2004. There was no release in 2003 or 2005. The next review will be completed in 2006 and thereafter will be completed annually.
k) Income Taxes
For periods prior to the corporate reorganization, the predecessor companies were included in the consolidated Australian income tax return of GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd, an indirect subsidiary of GE, and subject to a tax-sharing arrangement that allocated tax on a separate company basis and provided benefit for current utilization of losses and credits. Intercompany balances under all agreements were settled at least annually.
Effective May 21, 2004, Genworth Mortgage is included in a consolidated Australian income tax return of Genworth with its Australian parent company and, subject to a tax-sharing arrangement that allocates tax on a separate company basis and provides benefit for current utilization of losses and credits.
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are estimated based on the Company's assessment of the realizability of such amounts.
Accounting for Income Taxes.
l) Foreign Currency Translation
The local currency, the Australian dollar, is the functional currency for the Company. The determination of the functional currency is made based on the appropriate economic and management indicators. The financial statements have been translated into U.S dollars (the "reporting currency") in accordance with SFAS No. 52, . Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the Statement of Financial Position date or historical rates. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S dollars at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from this currency re-measurement are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in the Statement of Changes in Stockholder's Equity.
Foreign Currency Translation
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of foreign receivables or payables, are included in the statement of earnings.
m) Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted
The Company adopted FASB Interpretation 46 ("FIN 46R"), on July 1, 2003. FIN 46R represents a significant change in accounting principles governing consolidation of off balance sheet arrangements. One of the most common forms of off-balance sheet arrangements is asset securitization. Refer note 13 for details of the Company's transactions with conduits that are sponsored by third parties. There is no consolidation of those conduits in the financial statements of the Company.

On November 5, 2005, FASB Staff issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") Nos. 115-1 and 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments ("FSP Nos. 115-1 and 124-1"). FSP 115-1 and 124-1 address the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in this FSP shall be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. Adoption of FSP Nos. 115-1 and 124-1 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position.
As of January 1, 2006 the Company adopted SFAS No. 155, "" ("SFAS 155"). SFAS 155 amends SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140, " ("SFAS 140"). SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole, eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host, if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. In addition, among other changes, SFAS 155 (i) clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133; (ii) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; (iii) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and (iv) eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying special- purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial interest. Adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

n) Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In September 2005, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1, This statement provides guidance on accounting for deferred acquisition costs and other deferred balances on an internal replacement, defined broadly as a modification in product benefits, features, rights, or coverages that occurs by the exchange of an existing contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to an existing contract, or by the election of a benefit, feature, right, or coverage within an existing contract. Depending on the type of modification, the period over which these deferred balances will be recognized could be accelerated. SOP 05-1 is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact SOP 05-1 will have on its results of operations and financial position.
