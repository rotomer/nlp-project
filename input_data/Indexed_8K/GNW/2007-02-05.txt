Upon termination of his employment, Mr. Zippel will become fully vested in his retirement benefits under the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (payments under which will commence when he reaches age 60). In addition, a portion of the outstanding equity awards previously granted to Mr. Zippel, consisting of 21,411 stock options, 144,220 stock appreciation rights, and 20,948 restricted stock units, became fully vested as of the Effective Date. All other unvested equity awards granted to Mr. Zippel were cancelled as of the Effective Date. Prior to the termination of his employment, Mr. Zippel will continue to participate in the Company's benefit plans and other executive benefits that previously were available to him.
Mr. Zippel has agreed not to solicit employees of the Company for a period of two years following termination of his employment. In addition, Mr. Zippel has agreed not to solicit certain long-term care and life insurance clients or customers of the Company for a period of eighteen months following termination of his employment. The Separation Agreement also includes a mutual release of claims and a non-disparagement provision.
