Incorporated and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as remarketing agents (the "Remarketing Agents"), and The Bank of New York, as purchase contract agent and attorney-in-fact of the holders of equity units, relating to the Company's 3.84% senior notes due May 16, 2009 (the "Senior Notes"), originally issued as part of equity units issued by the Company in May 2004.

The Agreement provides, among other things, that the Remarketing Agents agree to use their reasonable efforts to obtain a price for the Senior Notes to be remarketed that results in proceeds of at least 100% of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes.

The Company will not receive any proceeds from the remarketing of the Senior Notes. The Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company. It also provides that the Company will indemnify the Remarketing Agents against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, arising out of or in connection with the Remarketing Agents' duties under the Agreement, and contribute to payments the Remarketing Agents may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

Each of the Remarketing Agents, severally and not jointly, acknowledges and
 
agrees that, except as may be set forth in Schedule III hereto, the Company has not authorized or approved any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h)) for use in any Free Writing Prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agents.

Section 8. Indemnification.
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Remarketing Agent, each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, any Electronic Road Show or the Prospectus (if used within the period, if any, that delivery of such Registration Statement, Preliminary
 
Prospectus, Time of Sale Prospectus, Free Writing Prospectus or Prospectus is required pursuant to the Securities Act and as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Remarketing Agents furnished to the Company in writing by the Remarketing Agents expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Remarketing Agent agrees, severally but not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the directors of the Company, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to the Remarketing Agents furnished to the Company in writing by the Remarketing Agents expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or Section 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
any local counsel) for the Remarketing Agents and all persons, if any who control the Remarketing Agents within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act and (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Remarketing Agents and such control persons and affiliates of the Remarketing Agents, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Remarketing Agents. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
Section 9. Contribution.
(a) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to under such paragraph, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) if the indemnifying party is the Company, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties, on the one hand, and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Senior Notes, (ii) if the Remarketing Agents are the indemnifying parties, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the Remarketing Agents' relative fault on one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or (iii) if the allocation provided by Section 9(a)(i) or Section 9(a)(ii) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in Section 9(a)(i) above or the relative fault referred to in Section 9(a)(ii) above but also the relative fault (in cases covered by Section 9(a)(ii)) or the relative benefits (in cases covered by Section 9(a)(i)) of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on one hand, and the Remarketing Agents, on the other hand, in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes less the Remarketing Fee on the one hand and the Remarketing Fee on the other
 
hand bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by any of the Remarketing Agents and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Remarketing Agents' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to the respective aggregate principal amount of Remarketed Senior Notes they have remarketed hereunder, and not joint.
(b) The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 9(a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Remarketing Fee exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in Section 8 and Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
(c) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 8 and Section 9 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent, any person controlling the Remarketing Agent or any affiliate of any Remarketing Agent or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Remarketed Senior Notes.
Section 10. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agents.
Either of the Remarketing Agents may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove either, or both, of the Remarketing Agents, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the removed Remarketing Agent and the Purchase Contract Agent; that no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects.
provided, however,
 
In any such case, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Section 8 and Section 9 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
Section 11. Dealing in Securities.
The Remarketing Agents, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in their individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketed Senior Notes, Corporate Units, Treasury Units or any of the securities of the Company (together, the ""). The Remarketing Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agents, in their individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.
Securities
Section 12. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care; No Fiduciary Relationship.
(a) The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agents shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. No implied covenants or obligations of or against any Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agents, a Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. Each Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties except as otherwise set forth herein. Any Remarketing Agent shall have no obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate on the Senior Notes or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Senior Notes, and it shall rely solely upon written notice from the Company (which the Company agrees to provide prior to the eighth Business Day before the Initial Remarketing Date) as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate. Any Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Senior Notes in its individual capacity or as a Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from its failure to comply with the material terms of this Agreement or bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The provisions of this Section 12 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the Remarketing: (a) the Remarketing Agents have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (b) the Remarketing Agents owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (c) the Remarketing Agents may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Remarketing Agents arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Remarketing.
