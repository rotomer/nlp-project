Exhibit 99.1
Richmond, VA (October 25, 2007)  Genworth Financial, Inc. (NYSE: GNW) today reported income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2007 of $339 million, or $0.76 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2006 was $294 million, or $0.63 per diluted share.
Net operating income for the third quarter of 2007 was $368 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to net operating income of $297 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006.
 
"I am pleased with the overall results in the quarter and in particular, the strong growth in the international and fee-based businesses," said Michael D. Fraizer, chairman and chief executive. "U.S. mortgage insurance results fell short of our targets reflecting the current U.S. residential real estate market, but were strong in light of a difficult operating environment. Given these challenges, our current outlook for full year net operating earnings per share is $3.00 to $3.10."

Segment Results
Net operating income presented in the tables below excludes net investment gains (losses) and other adjustments, net of taxes, as well as the results from discontinued operations. In the discussion of International results, all references to percentage changes exclude the impact of foreign exchange. The impact of foreign exchange on net operating income in the third quarter of 2007 was a favorable $12 million.
A reconciliation of net operating income (loss) of segments and Corporate and Other activities to net income is included at the end of this press release.
 
Retirement and Protection
 
Retirement and Protection's net operating income increased 31 percent to $223 million from strong growth in fee-based earnings and a lower effective tax rate.
Managed money earnings more than doubled to $11 million in the current quarter. This performance was attributable to a three-fold increase in AUM to $21.7 billion from strong net flows, equity market appreciation and the acquisition of AssetMark.
 
 
Managed money net flows were $1.1 billion reflecting product and distribution expansion.
Retirement income fee-based earnings more than doubled from $16 million to $40 million reflecting a 71 percent growth in AUM and an increase of $18 million related to favorable tax adjustments versus the prior year. These were partially offset by lower third-party service related fees. Fee-based retirement income sales grew 51 percent from strong demand for income distribution series products and expanded wholesaling efforts.
Retirement income spread-based earnings grew 83 percent from $23 million to $42 million on wider fixed annuity spreads from cumulative crediting rate resets that were partially offset by lower account balances. The product line also benefited from higher limited partnership income as well as a lower effective tax rate. Lower fixed annuity sales reflected both the unfavorable yield curve environment and competitive pressures.
Institutional earnings were up 11 percent from growth in AUM. Institutional sales of $224 million included $200 million of funding agreements backing notes.
Life insurance earnings increased 3 percent as insurance in-force growth and limited partnership income were partially offset by higher term life mortality and lower term life persistency. Total life sales grew 39 percent to $96 million with strong universal life sales in both single premium and excess deposits offsetting a 22 percent decline in term life.
LTC earnings were relatively flat, as good new business returns and a $7 million favorable reserve adjustment were offset by weak old block performance. LTC sales increased 18 percent to $60 million driven by $8 million of linked benefits product sales. Prior year individual LTC sales included an estimated $6 million of sales acceleration associated with a 2006 new business rate change in California. Filings for the recently announced rate action on the old LTC block have been completed in more than 40 states with the approval process complete or nearly complete in approximately 25 percent of states, representing average rate increases of 10 percent.
 
International
 
International's net operating income increased 20 percent, reflecting strong revenue growth in both payment protection and mortgage insurance. The payment protection business demonstrated solid progress in penetrating both new and existing markets. International mortgage insurance business continued to perform well, as insurance in force increased 26 percent to $462 billion and compared to last year, unearned premium reserves increased 29 percent to $3.3 billion. Margins remained strong in this business with an international mortgage insurance loss ratio of 32 percent.
In Canada, net operating income was up 17 percent from a 29 percent increase in premium, partially offset by moderately higher losses as the book seasons, and a higher effective tax rate. In Australia, net operating income increased 23 percent from a 35 percent increase in premium, partially offset by higher losses. Other international mortgage insurance contributed $6 million to earnings from growth in Europe. In payment protection, net operating income was up 8 percent as strong revenue growth was partially offset by increased losses, expenses, and an unfavorable tax item in the quarter.
 
International mortgage insurance sales grew 15 percent. In Canada, total sales were up 6 percent driven by a 27 percent increase in flow sales as Genworth continued to increase penetration with existing lenders and gain share in the growing Canadian mortgage insurance market. In Australia, sales grew 32 percent primarily from a bulk transaction with a large lender. Payment protection sales grew 9 percent from solid performance in established markets and strong progress in new markets in Continental Europe, Mexico and Canada.
U.S. Mortgage Insurance
 
U.S. Mortgage Insurance's net operating income declined by $14 million to $39 million, as a 35 percent increase in premiums was more than offset by higher losses.
Primary insurance in-force (IIF) increased 39 percent to $144.8 billion while primary risk in-force (RIF) increased 25 percent to $28.1 billion. The IIF increase was driven by strong growth in both the flow and prime bulk channels, coupled with an 8 point rise in flow persistency to 82 percent. The RIF growth rate reflects thinner coverage in prime bulk transactions. Flow mortgage insurance sales increased 91 percent to $13.2 billion reflecting growth of the mortgage insurance market. Bulk sales increased $1.6 billion from selective participation in the GSE Alt-A channel.
 
Paid claims increased $13 million, before tax, primarily driven by higher average claim amounts due to higher loan balances. During the quarter, reserves increased a net $75 million, before tax, primarily resulting from significant increases in delinquencies and foreclosures, especially in Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada, as well as in A minus and Alt-A products. Paid claims for the full year are expected to be in the range of $160 - $185 million, consistent with prior outlook, with net operating earnings in the range of approximately $170 - $200 million for the full year 2007.
Corporate and Other
 
The Corporate and Other net operating loss was approximately flat at $34 million, from decreased expenses, offset by lower investment income on surplus and higher debt related costs.
Investment Highlights
During the quarter, after-tax net investment income related to bond calls, commercial mortgage loan prepayments and limited partnership investments was $24 million compared to $8 million in the prior year quarter.
Third quarter investment losses of $29 million, net of tax and other offsets, included $16 million of impairments, $11 million of which related to sub-prime and Alt-A residential mortgage and asset-backed securities.
 
Stockholders' Equity
Stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2007 was $13.3 billion, or $30.32 per share, compared with $13.3 billion, or $29.44 per share, as of September 30, 2006. Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, as of September 30, 2007 was $12.6 billion, or $28.73 per share, compared with $12.1 billion, or $26.86 per share, as of September 30, 2006.
Share Repurchases
During the quarter, Genworth repurchased 3.6 million shares at a weighted average price of $28.72 per share. As of September 30, 2007, Genworth had completed its current repurchase authorization.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "net operating income." Our chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources on the basis of net operating income. We define net operating
 
income (loss) as income (loss) from continuing operations excluding after-tax net investment gains (losses) and other adjustments and infrequent or unusual non-operating items. We exclude net investment gains (losses) and infrequent or unusual non-operating items because we do not consider them to be related to the operating performance of our segments and Corporate and Other activities. A significant component of our net investment gains (losses) are the result of credit-related impairments and credit-related gains and losses, the timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles. In addition, the size and timing of other investment gains (losses) are often subject to our discretion and are influenced by market opportunities, as well as asset-liability matching considerations. Infrequent or unusual non-operating items are also excluded from net operating income if, in our opinion, they are not indicative of overall operating trends. While some of these items may be significant components of net income in accordance with GAAP, we believe that net operating income, and measures that are derived from or incorporate net operating income, are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income attributable to the ongoing operations of the business. However, net operating income should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net income. In addition, the company's definition of net operating income may differ from the definitions used by other companies. There were no infrequent or unusual non-operating items excluded from net operating income for the periods presented in this press release. The table at the end of this press release reflects net operating income (loss) as determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, , and a reconciliation of net operating income (loss) of our segments and Corporate and Other activities to net income for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006.
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
Due to the unpredictable nature of the items excluded from the company's definition of net operating income, the company is unable to reconcile its outlook for net operating income to net income presented in accordance with GAAP.
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "adjusted expense ratio" as a measure of productivity. The company defines adjusted expense ratio as acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, divided by total revenues, excluding the effects of the company's managed money and payment protection insurance businesses. The managed money and payment protection insurance businesses are excluded from this ratio as its expense base is comprised of varying levels of non-deferrable acquisition costs. Management believes that the expense ratio analysis enhances understanding of the productivity of the company. However, the adjusted expense ratio as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, divided by total revenues. The tables at the end of this press release include a reconciliation of the adjusted expense ratio, as defined, to the GAAP measure.
Definition of Selected Operating Performance Measures
Management regularly monitors and reports a production volume metric referred to as "sales," which is a measure commonly used in the insurance industry as a measure of
 
volume of new and renewal business generated in a period. "Sales" refers to (1) annualized first-year premiums for term life insurance, long term care insurance and Medicare supplement insurance; (2) new and additional premiums/deposits for universal life insurance, linked-benefits, spread-based and variable annuity products; (3) gross and net flows for our managed money business which represent gross flows net of redemptions; (4) written premiums and deposits, gross of ceded reinsurance and cancellations, and premium equivalents, where we can earn a fee for administrative services only business, for payment protection insurance; (5) new insurance written for mortgage insurance, which in each case reflects the amount of business the company generated during each period presented; and (6) written premiums net of cancellations for our Mexican insurance operations. Sales do not include renewal premiums on policies or contracts written during prior periods. The company considers annualized first-year premiums, new premiums/deposits, written premiums, premium equivalents and new insurance written to be a measure of the company's operating performance because they represent a measure of new sales of insurance policies or contracts during a specified period, rather than a measure of the company's revenues or profitability during that period. This operating measure enables the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources.
Management regularly monitors and reports assets under management for our managed money business. Assets under management for our managed money business represent third-party assets under management that are not consolidated in our financial statements. The company considers assets under management for our managed money business to be a measure of the company's operating performance because it represents a measure of the size of our business at a specific date, rather than a measure of the company's revenues or profitability during that period.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as "expects," "intends," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "will," or words of similar meaning and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook for the company's future business and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.

This financial supplement includes other non-GAAP measures management believes enhances the understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers. These additional non-GAAP measures are on pages 61 through 65 of this financial supplement.

Selected Operating Performance Measures
This financial supplement contains selected operating performance measures including "sales," "assets under management," "insurance in-force" or "risk in-force" which are commonly used in the insurance and investment industries as measures of operating performance.
Management regularly monitors and reports the sales metrics as a measure of volume of new and renewal business generated in a period. Sales refers to (1) annualized first-year premiums for term life insurance, long-term care insurance and Medicare supplement insurance; (2) new and additional premiums/deposits for universal life insurance, linked-benefits, spread-based and variable products; (3) gross flows and net flows, which represent gross flows less redemptions, for our managed money business; (4) written premiums and deposits, gross of ceded reinsurance and cancellations, and premium equivalents, where we earn a fee for administrative services only business, for payment protection insurance; (5) new insurance written for mortgage insurance, which in each case reflects the amount of business the company generated during each period presented; and (6) written premiums net of cancellations for our Mexican insurance operations. Sales do not include renewal premiums on policies or contracts written during prior periods.
The company considers annualized first-year premiums, new premiums/deposits, gross and net flows, written premiums, premium equivalents and new insurance written to be a measure of the company's operating performance because they represent a measure of new sales of insurance policies or contracts during a specified period, rather than a measure of the company's revenues or profitability during that period.
Management regularly monitors and reports assets under management for our managed money business, insurance in-force and risk in-force. Assets under management for our managed money business represent third-party assets under management that are not consolidated in our financial statements. Insurance in-force for our life insurance, international mortgage insurance and U.S. mortgage insurance businesses is a measure of the aggregate face value of outstanding insurance policies as of the respective reporting date. Risk in-force for our international mortgage insurance and U.S. mortgage insurance businesses is a measure that recognizes that the loss on any particular mortgage loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the underlying property. The company considers assets under management for our managed money business, insurance in-force and risk in-force to be a measure of the company's operating performance because they represent a measure of the size of our business at a specific date, rather than a measure of the company's revenues or profitability during that period.
These operating measures enable the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources.

Supplemental Analysis for Change in Accounting:
During the fourth quarter of 2006, approximately $73 million of premiums related to certain reinsurance assumed business were reclassified from reinsurance accounting to the deposit method of accounting. This change in accounting also resulted in reclassifications in the investment income, benefits and other changes in policyholder reserves and interest expense captions on the income statement, but had no impact on income or net operating income in the fourth quarter of 2006. The fourth quarter 2006 reclassification to the deposit method of accounting presented on page 42 was treated as a cumulative catch-up for the previous three quarters of 2006.
To better facilitate the analysis of PPI's sales, revenue and expense trends, the above represents all 2006 quarterly income statements and sales data on a basis consistent with these reinsurance assumed arrangements being accounted for under the deposit method of accounting. This change in accounting had no impact on income from continuing operations or net operating income for all periods presented.

Non-GAAP Definition for Operating ROE
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "operating return on equity" or "operating ROE." The company defines operating ROE as net operating income divided by average ending stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in average ending stockholders' equity. Management believes that analysis of operating ROE enhances understanding of the efficiency with which the company deploys its capital. However, operating ROE as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net income divided by average ending stockholders' equity.

Non-GAAP Definition for Expense Ratio
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "expense ratio" as a measure of productivity. The company defines expense ratio as acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, divided by total revenues, excluding the effects of the company's managed money and payment protection insurance business. The managed money and payment protection insurance business is excluded from this ratio as its expense base is comprised of varying levels of non-deferrable acquisition costs. Management believes that the expense ratio analysis enhances understanding of the productivity of the company. However, the expense ratio as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, divided by total revenues.

Non-GAAP Definition for Core Premiums
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "core premiums" as a measure of premium growth. The company defines core premiums as earned premiums less premiums on run-off and Travel Insurance blocks in our payment protection insurance business, premiums from our retirement incomespread-based business and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. The retirement incomespread-based premiums are excluded in this measure primarily because these are single premiums and are not an indication of future premiums. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates are excluded in this measure to present periods on a comparable exchange rate. Management believes that analysis of core premiums enhances understanding of premium growth of the company. However, core premiums as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP earned premiums.

Non-GAAP Definition for Core Yield
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "core yield" as a measure of investment yield. The company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for those items that are not recurring in nature. Management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company. However, core yield as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP investment yield.

Industry Ratings
Our principal life insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, Standard and Poors (S&P), Moody's and Fitch as follows:
 
Our principal mortgage insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P, Moody's and Fitch as follows:
 
The A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's and Fitch ratings are not designed to be, and do not serve as, measures of protection or valuation offered to investors. These financial strength ratings should not be relied on with respect to making an investment in our securities.
A.M. Best states that its "A+" (Superior) rating is assigned to those companies that have, in its opinion, a superior ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. The "A+" (Superior) rating is the second-highest of fifteen ratings assigned by A.M. Best, which range from "A++" to "S."
S&P states that an insurer rated "AA" (Very Strong) has very strong financial security characteristics that outweigh any vulnerabilities, and is highly likely to have the ability to meet financial commitments. The "AA" range is the second-highest of the four ratings ranges that meet these criteria, and also is the second-highest of nine financial strength rating ranges assigned by S&P, which range from "AAA" to "R." A plus (+) or minus (-) shows relative standing in a rating category. Accordingly, the "AA" and "AA-" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of S&P's 20 ratings categories. The short-term "A-1" rating is the highest rating and shows the capacity to meet financial commitments is strong. Within this category, the designation of a plus sign (+) indicates capacity to meet its financial commitments is extremely strong.
 
Table of Contents
Industry Ratings (continued)
 
Moody's states that insurance companies rated "Aa" (Excellent) offer excellent financial security. Moody's states that companies in this group constitute what are generally known as high-grade companies. The "Aa" range is the second-highest of nine financial strength rating ranges assigned by Moody's, which range from "Aaa" to "C." Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group, with 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest. Accordingly, the "Aa2" and "Aa3" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of Moody's 21 ratings categories. Short-term rating "P1" is the highest rating and shows superior ability for repayment of short-term debt obligations.
Fitch states that "AA" (Very Strong) rated insurance companies are viewed as possessing very strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. Risk factors are modest, and the impact of any adverse business and economic factors is expected to be very small. The "AA" rating category is the second-highest of eight financial strength rating categories, which range from "AAA" to "D." The symbol (+) or (-) may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within a rating category. These suffixes are not added to ratings in the "AAA" category or to ratings below the "CCC" category. Accordingly, the "AA" and "AA-" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of Fitch's 24 ratings categories.
DBRS states that long-term debt rated AA is of superior credit quality, and protection of interest and principal is considered high. In many cases they differ from long-term debt rated AAA only to a small degree. Given the extremely restrictive definition DBRS has for the AAA category, entities rated AA are also considered to be strong credits, typically exemplifying above-average strength in key areas of consideration and unlikely to be significantly affected by reasonably foreseeable events.
A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS review their ratings periodically and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current ratings in the future. Other agencies may also rate our company or our insurance subsidiaries on a solicited or an unsolicited basis.
