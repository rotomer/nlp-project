Exhibit 99.1
Genworth Financial Reports Third Quarter Net Operating Income
Of $0.51 Per Diluted ShareLoss From Continuing Operations of $0.60
Per Diluted Share
Richmond, VA (November 6, 2008)  Genworth Financial, Inc. (NYSE: GNW) today reported a loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2008 of $258 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared with income of $339 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007. Net operating income for the third quarter of 2008 was $220 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to net operating income of $368 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007.
 
Third quarter results reflected net investment losses of $478 million, net of tax and amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC), including $321 million of credit and/or cash flow related impairments, $55 million of impairments related to a change of intent to hold securities to recovery and $86 million of net realized losses from asset sales associated primarily with portfolio repositioning activities. Of total impairments, $153 million, net of tax, related to sub-prime and Alt-A residential mortgage and asset-backed securities, and $145 million, net of tax, in corporate bonds concentrated among several large financial services issuers.
 
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, requires that tax benefits be recorded during the year in proportion to pre-tax income. As a result, tax benefits on operating income that would otherwise have been recognized earlier in the year are recognized in the third quarter, and the operating effective tax rate was nearly eight percent in the quarter and 26 percent year to date. On a full year basis, Genworth's effective tax rate on operating income is expected to be between 23 percent and 25 percent.
"This was a disappointing quarter for the company, which was compounded by the ongoing turmoil in the credit, equity and housing markets," said Michael D. Fraizer, chairman and chief executive officer. "In this unprecedented period, we are focused on maintaining appropriate liquidity, and taking additional steps to strengthen our capital levels and maximize our flexibility. Among immediate actions taken are the suspension of our common stock dividend, the formal suspension of our share repurchase program, which has been inactive since the first quarter, and the contribution of $500 million of cash from the holding company to our life operating companies, leaving those companies with a combined 360 percent RBC at the end of the third quarter. We are also looking at other avenues  including the potential for asset sales, debt refinancing or a possible capital raise. These steps may be needed to navigate continued market uncertainty and turmoil in the credit markets, while effectively positioning Genworth for the future."
Strategic Highlights:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Genworth is also suspending operating earnings outlook for 2008.
Segment Results
Net operating income (loss) presented in the tables below excludes net investment gains (losses), net of taxes and other adjustments. In the discussion of International results, all references to percentage changes exclude the impact of foreign exchange. The impact of foreign exchange on net operating income in the third quarter of 2008 was a favorable $5 million.
A reconciliation of net operating income (loss) of segments and Corporate and Other activities to net income (loss) is included at the end of this press release.
 
Retirement and Protection
 
 
 
Retirement and Protection earnings declined $45 million to $178 million, primarily from lower investment income, unfavorable equity markets and a $12 million goodwill impairment in the institutional product line. The decline in net investment income included $36 million lower limited partnership earnings and $15 million related to lower bond calls, mortgage loan prepayments and higher cash balances in a lower short term interest rate environment. The decline in the equity markets resulted in $15 million of additional DAC amortization, higher death benefits and lower fees. These were partially offset by $52 million of income from granting an early redemption request from a distressed institutional customer for funding agreements backing notes (FABNs), at a price discounted to contract value.
Wealth management earnings were $12 million, up nine percent despite equity market declines. AUM declined to $18.7 billion as equity market declines surpassed the $183 million of positive net flows.
Retirement income fee-based results in the quarter were a $1 million net loss, reflecting weak equity market performance that resulted in $8 million of higher DAC amortization, $5 million in higher guaranteed death and withdrawal benefits, in addition to $3 million of lower service related fees. Results in the prior year included a favorable $22 million tax benefit related to the dividends received deduction.
 
 
Retirement income spread-based earnings declined to $16 million. Earnings in the current quarter reflected $25 million in lower net investment income from limited partnerships, bond calls, pre-payments and higher cash balances. In addition, there was approximately $5 million of unfavorable mortality as compared to the prior year. These declines were partially offset by lower taxes. Spread-based sales more than doubled to $727 million from higher sales of both immediate annuities and deferred annuities.
Institutional earnings increased to $49 million driven by $52 million of income from the early FABN redemptions noted previously, partially offset by the impairment of all the remaining $12 million of goodwill associated with the product line and the impact of an 18 percent decline in AUM. The goodwill impairment reflects the impact of distressed market conditions on new business viability and the profitability of older blocks. Institutional sales were $458 million. AUM declined $2.0 billion from the September 30, 2007 level of $11.3 billion, primarily from scheduled maturities.
Life insurance earnings decreased to $63 million, as a result of $11 million of lower limited partnership income and ongoing, higher life reserve funding costs. Universal life sales decreased 19 percent, reflecting smaller policy sizes and lower excess deposits. Term life sales decreased 25 percent, reflecting intense pricing competition and the company's continued shift to focus on the middle market which has a smaller average policy size.
Long term care earnings remained flat as profit emergence associated with new block business growth and performance was offset by lower limited partnership investment income. Total long term care sales increased seven percent to $64 million as growth in career channel and Medicare supplement sales offset lower sales through independent distribution.
 
International
 
 
Total International earnings increased 15 percent to $166 million. Canadian and Australian mortgage insurance businesses contributed double-digit earnings growth, as did the company's lifestyle protection business.
 
 
In Canada, earnings grew 16 percent to $80 million from higher premiums, offset partially by higher losses as in force vintages season normally. The loss ratio increased to 25 percent, driven by the seasoning of the larger 2006 and 2007 book years in a slowing economic environment with the loss ratio remaining well below pricing expectations. In Australia, earnings grew 31 percent to $48 million from solid revenue growth and lower taxes. The loss ratio was 48 percent, down slightly from a year ago and higher sequentially as a result of higher mortgage rates and the seasoning of the 2006 and 2007 books in a slowing economy. The net loss of other international mortgage insurance business was $2 million, primarily from higher delinquencies in Spain, where active loss mitigation continues.
Slowing mortgage originations, coupled with selective risk management actions, resulted in a decline in new insurance written in most international markets. In Canada and Australia, flow new insurance written decreased 27 percent and 28 percent, respectively. The decrease in global mortgage securitizations also resulted in very limited bulk sales in both Canada and Australia.
Lifestyle protection earnings increased 23 percent to $40 million, primarily as a result of lower expenses, a lower tax rate and a favorable reserve adjustment for a reinsurance block of business, partially offset by increased claims. Total lifestyle protection sales declined to $636 million from lower sales in the U.K. and Ireland, reflecting declining levels of consumer lending. Sales in established regions, outside of the U.K. and Ireland, grew three percent.
U.S. Mortgage Insurance
 
 
U.S. Mortgage Insurance had a $121 million net operating loss as 16 percent earned premium growth and higher lender captive reinsurance coverage were more than offset by higher incurred losses and higher expenses. Earnings in the quarter benefited from $169 million pretax of lender captive reinsurance coverage. Expenses in the quarter included a write-down of $20 million representing all DAC associated with the 2006 and 2007 book years, which demonstrated declining performance, and a $22 million impairment of all goodwill associated with the segment.
The gross increase in U.S. mortgage insurance loss reserves was $339 million. Flow net reserves increased $132 million, primarily from increased delinquency counts and reserve strengthening in the 2006 and 2007 book years concentrated primarily in what are referred to as the sand states of Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada, which was partially offset by $169 million of lender captive reinsurance coverage. On a year to date basis, more than 65 percent of the reserve build was related to mortgages in the sand states, which represented 18 percent of flow risk in force. In addition, flow delinquency trends increased in Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey and Minnesota. Bulk reserves increased $38 million in the quarter, primarily from portfolio and GSE Alt-A transactions, where delinquencies have exceeded deductible layers.
Paid claims were $132 million, before taxes, an increase of $83 million versus the third quarter of 2007 and $40 million, sequentially. The average paid claim was $48,600, up from $35,800 a year ago, reflecting higher loan balances in recent book years and a shift in claims to higher loan balance states.
Loss mitigation activities, including workouts and presales, resulted in $41 million of reduced loss exposure for the third quarter, up 95 percent from 2007. The company approved approximately 4,000 workouts, modifications, and presales during the quarter. In addition, investigations and policy rescissions associated with misrepresentation, ineligibility, and policy exclusions resulted in a $76 million reduction in loss exposure.
 
Flow new insurance written decreased 53 percent to $6.2 billion as overall mortgage originations declined significantly in the quarter and from underwriting and guideline restrictions initiated throughout 2008 including in the quarter, as well as from a higher percentage of the mortgage insurance market going to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Underwriting and guideline changes for risk management effectively excluded sales of alternative products such as Alt-A, A minus, and 100 percent loan to value (LTV) loans, which combined represented only one percent of new insurance written during the quarter. Additional steps have been taken to limit production in markets where home prices are expected to decline, bringing the total number of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) from 140 in the second quarter of 2008 to 178 at present, where new business is limited to products with a 90 percent or below LTV along with other underwriting conditions. Finally, flow persistency remained strong, rising to 88 percent from 82 percent a year ago.
Genworth recently announced that it will no longer participate in excess of loss captive reinsurance transactions as of January 1, 2009 and going forward on new production it will only consider participation in quota share reinsurance arrangements.
Corporate and Other
 
Corporate and Other had a net operating loss of $3 million, compared to a $34 million loss in the prior year, primarily from lower taxes.
Investments
Third quarter net realized investment losses of $478 million, net of tax and amortization of DAC, included $321 million of credit and/or cash flow related impairments and $55 million of impairments related to a change of intent to hold securities to recovery, all net of tax. Of total impairments, $153 million, net of tax, related to sub-prime and Alt-A residential mortgage and asset-backed securities, (with the majority currently rated below single-A), and $145 million, net of tax, in corporate bonds concentrated among several large financial services issuers.
 
The company also realized $86 million of after-tax investment losses from asset sales, associated principally with portfolio repositioning activities.
Limited partnerships generated a $20 million loss compared to a $17 million gain a year ago reflecting declines in real estate partnerships. Bond calls and mortgage loan prepayments were $2 million, net of tax and DAC, compared with $9 million a year ago.
Retirement income fee-based net income included a $22 million loss, net of DAC and tax, from hedge ineffectiveness related to fund underperformance and volatility in the equity markets. Hedging is used to manage the risk associated with living benefit guarantees for the income distribution series products.
Stockholders' Equity
Stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2008 was $10.5 billion, or $24.24 per share, compared with $13.3 billion, or $30.32 per share, as of September 30, 2007. Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), as of September 30, 2008 was $12.3 billion, or $28.44 per share, compared with $12.6 billion, or $28.73 per share, as of September 30, 2007.
The fixed maturity securities portfolio had gross unrealized investment losses of $5,480 million, compared to $3,546 million at the end of the prior quarter, and gross unrealized investment gains of $373 million, versus $549 million in the prior quarter. As of September 30, 2007, our fixed maturity securities portfolio had gross unrealized investment losses of $1,475 million and gross unrealized investment gains of $806 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "net operating income (loss)." The chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources on the basis of net operating income (loss). The company defines net operating income (loss) as income (loss) from continuing operations excluding after-tax net investment gains (losses) and other adjustments and infrequent or unusual non-operating items. This metric excludes these items because the company does not consider them to be related to the operating performance of its segments and Corporate and Other activities. A significant component of the net investment gains (losses) is the result of impairments, including changes in intent to hold securities to recovery and credit-related gains and losses, the timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles. In addition, the size and timing of other investment gains (losses) are often subject to Genworth's discretion and are influenced by market opportunities, as well as asset-liability matching considerations. Infrequent or unusual non-operating items are also excluded from net operating income (loss) if, in the company's opinion, they are not indicative of overall operating trends. While some of these items may be significant components
 
of net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, the company believes that net operating income (loss), and measures that are derived from or incorporate net operating income (loss), are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income (loss) attributable to the ongoing operations of the business. However, net operating income (loss) is not viewed as a substitute for GAAP net income (loss). In addition, the company's definition of net operating income (loss) may differ from the definitions used by other companies. There were no infrequent or unusual non-operating items excluded from net operating income (loss) during the periods presented in this press release. The tables at the end of this press release reflect net operating income (loss) as determined in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, , and a reconciliation of net operating income (loss) of the company's segments and Corporate and Other activities to net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007.

Definition of Selected Operating Performance Measures
Management regularly monitors and reports a production volume metric referred to as "sales," which is a measure commonly used in the insurance industry as a measure of volume of new and renewal business generated in a period. "Sales" refers to (1) annualized first-year premiums for term life insurance, long term care insurance and Medicare supplement insurance; (2) new and additional premiums/deposits for universal life insurance, linked-benefits, spread-based and variable products; (3) gross and net flows for the wealth management business which represent gross flows less redemptions; (4) written premiums and deposits, gross of ceded reinsurance and cancellations, and premium equivalents, where we earn a fee for administrative services only business, for lifestyle protection insurance; (5) new insurance written for mortgage insurance, which in each case reflects the amount of business the company generated during each period presented; and (6) written premiums, net of cancellations, for the Mexican insurance operations. Sales do not include renewal premiums on policies or contracts written during prior periods. The company considers annualized first-year premiums, new premiums/deposits, gross and net flows, written premiums, premium equivalents and new insurance written to be measures of the company's operating performance because they represent measures of new sales of insurance policies or contracts during a specified period, rather than measures of the company's revenues or profitability during that period.
 
Management regularly monitors and reports assets under management for the wealth management business, insurance in-force and risk in-force. Assets under management for the wealth management business represent third-party assets under management that are not consolidated in the financial statements. Insurance in-force for the life insurance, international mortgage insurance and U.S. mortgage insurance businesses is a measure of the aggregate face value of outstanding insurance policies as of the respective reporting date. Risk in-force for the international and U.S. mortgage insurance businesses is a measure that recognizes that the loss on any particular mortgage loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the underlying property. The company considers assets under management for its wealth management business, insurance in-force and risk in-force to be measures of the company's operating performance because they represent measures of the size of the business at a specific date, rather than measures of the company's revenues or profitability during that period.
These operating measures enable the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures
This financial supplement includes the non-GAAP
(1)
financial measure entitled "net operating income (loss)." Our chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources on the basis of net operating income (loss). We define net operating income (loss) as income (loss) from continuing operations excluding after-tax net investment gains (losses) and other adjustments and infrequent or unusual non-operating items. We exclude net investment gains (losses) and infrequent or unusual non-operating items because we do not consider them to be related to the operating performance of our segments and Corporate and Other activities. A significant component of our net investment gains (losses) is the result of impairments, including changes in intent to hold securities to recovery, and credit-related gains and losses, the timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles. In addition, the size and timing of other investment gains (losses) are often subject to our discretion and are influenced by market opportunities, as well as asset-liability matching considerations. Infrequent or unusual non-operating items are also excluded from net operating income (loss) if, in our opinion, they are not indicative of overall operating trends. While some of these items may be significant components of net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, we believe that net operating income (loss), and measures that are derived from or incorporate net operating income (loss), are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income (loss) attributable to the ongoing operations of the business. However, net operating income (loss) is not a substitute for net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company's definition of net operating income (loss) may differ from the definitions used by other companies. The table on page 8 of this report reflects net operating income (loss) as determined in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, , and a reconciliation of net operating income (loss) of our segments and Corporate and Other activities to net income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007. This financial supplement includes other non-GAAP measures management believes enhances the understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers. These additional non-GAAP measures are on pages 66 through 70 of this financial supplement.

Selected Operating Performance Measures
This financial supplement contains selected operating performance measures including "sales", "assets under management" and "insurance in-force" or "risk in-force" which are commonly used in the insurance and investment industries as measures of operating performance.
Management regularly monitors and reports the sales metrics as a measure of volume of new and renewal business generated in a period. Sales refers to (1) annualized first-year premiums for term life, long-term care and Medicare supplement insurance; (2) new and additional premiums/deposits for universal life insurance, linked-benefits, spread-based and variable products; (3) gross and net flows, which represent gross flows less redemptions, for our wealth management
(2)
business; (4) written premiums and deposits, gross of ceded reinsurance and cancellations, and premium equivalents, where we earn a fee for administrative services only business, for lifestyle protection insurance business
(3)
; (5) new insurance written for mortgage insurance, which in each case reflects the amount of business the company generated during each period presented; and (6) written premiums, net of cancellations, for our Mexican insurance operations. Sales do not include renewal premiums on policies or contracts written during prior periods.
The company considers annualized first-year premiums, new premiums/deposits, gross flows and net flows, written premiums, premium equivalents and new insurance written to be measures of the company's operating performance because they represent a measure of new sales of insurance policies or contracts during a specified period, rather than measures of the company's revenues or profitability during that period.
Management regularly monitors and reports assets under management for our wealth management business, insurance in-force and risk in-force. Assets under management for our wealth management business represent third-party assets under management that are not consolidated in our financial statements. Insurance in-force for our life insurance, international and U.S. mortgage insurance businesses is a measure of the aggregate face value of outstanding insurance policies as of the respective reporting date. Risk in-force for our international and U.S. mortgage insurance businesses is a measure that recognizes that the loss on any particular mortgage loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the underlying property. The company considers assets under management for our wealth management business, insurance in-force and risk in-force to be measures of the company's operating performance because they represent measures of the size of our business at a specific date, rather than measures of the company's revenues or profitability during that period.
These operating measures enable the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources.

Non-GAAP Definition for Operating ROE
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "operating return on equity" or "operating ROE." The company defines operating ROE as net operating income divided by average ending stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) in average ending stockholders' equity. Management believes that analysis of operating ROE enhances understanding of the efficiency with which the company deploys its capital. However, operating ROE as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP net income (loss) divided by average ending stockholders' equity.

Non-GAAP Definition for Expense Ratio
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "expense ratio" as a measure of productivity. The company defines expense ratio as acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, divided by total revenues, excluding the effects of the company's wealth management and lifestyle protection businesses. The wealth management and lifestyle protection businesses are excluded from this ratio as their expense bases are comprised of varying levels of non-deferrable acquisition costs. Management believes that the expense ratio analysis enhances understanding of the productivity of the company. However, the expense ratio as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP acquisition and operating expenses, net of deferrals, divided by total revenues.

Non-GAAP Definition for Core Premiums
The company references the non-GAAP financial measure entitled "core premiums" as a measure of premium growth. The company defines core premiums as earned premiums less premiums from our retirement incomespread-based business and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. The retirement incomespread-based premiums are excluded in this measure primarily because these are single premiums and are not an indication of future premiums. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates are excluded in this measure to present periods on a comparable exchange rate. Management believes that analysis of core premiums enhances understanding of premium growth of the company. However, core premiums as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP earned premiums.

However, core yield as defined by the company should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP investment yield.

Industry Ratings
Our principal life insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, Standard and Poor's (S&P), Moody's and Fitch as follows:
 
Our mortgage insurance subsidiaries are rated by S&P and Moody's as follows:
 
 
The A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's and Fitch ratings are not designed to be, and do not serve as, measures of protection or valuation offered to investors. These financial strength ratings should not be relied on with respect to making an investment in our securities.
A.M. Best states that its "A+" (Superior) rating is assigned to those companies that have, in its opinion, a superior ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. The "A" and "A-" (Excellent) ratings are assigned to companies that have, in its opinion, an excellent ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations. The "A+" (Superior), "A" and "A-" (Excellent) ratings are the second-, third- and fourth-highest of fifteen ratings assigned by A.M. Best, which range from "A++" to "F."
S&P states that an insurer rated "AA" (Very Strong) has very strong financial security characteristics that outweigh any vulnerabilities, and is highly likely to have the ability to meet financial commitments. The "AA" range is the second-highest of the four ratings ranges that meet these criteria, and also is the second-highest of nine financial strength rating ranges assigned by S&P, which range from "AAA" to "R." A plus (+) or minus (-) shows relative standing in a rating category. Accordingly, the "AA" and "AA-" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of S&P's 21 ratings categories. The short-term "A-1" rating is the highest rating and shows the capacity to meet financial commitments is strong. Within this category, the designation of a plus sign (+) indicates capacity to meet its financial commitments is extremely strong. An obligor rated "mxAAA" has a very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments relative to that of other Mexican obligors. The "mxAAA" rating is the highest enterprise credit rating assigned on S&P's CaVal national scale.

Industry Ratings (continued)
Moody's states that insurance companies rated "Aa" (Excellent) offer excellent financial security. Moody's states that companies in this group constitute what are generally known as high-grade companies. The "Aa" range is the second-highest of nine financial strength rating ranges assigned by Moody's, which range from "Aaa" to "C." Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group, with 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest. Accordingly, the "Aa2" and "Aa3" ratings are the third- and fourth-highest of Moody's 21 ratings categories. Short-term rating "P-1" is the highest rating and shows superior ability for repayment of short-term debt obligations. Issuers or issues rated "Aaa.mx" demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness relative to other issuers in Mexico.
Fitch states that "A" (Strong) rated insurance companies are viewed as possessing strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. The "A" rating category is the third-highest of eight financial strength rating categories, which range from "AAA" to "C." The symbol (+) or (-) may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within a rating category. These suffixes are not added to ratings in the "AAA" category or to ratings below the "CCC" category. Accordingly, the "A+" rating is the fifth-highest of Fitch's 21 ratings categories.
DBRS states that long-term debt rated "AA" is of superior credit quality, and protection of interest and principal is considered high. In many cases they differ from long-term debt rated "AAA" only to a small degree. Given the extremely restrictive definition DBRS has for the "AAA" category, entities rated "AA" are also considered to be strong credits, typically exemplifying above-average strength in key areas of consideration and unlikely to be significantly affected by reasonably foreseeable events.
A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS review their ratings periodically and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current ratings in the future. Other agencies may also rate our company or our insurance subsidiaries on a solicited or an unsolicited basis.
