Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 7, 2009, Genworth MI Canada Inc. ("Genworth Canada"), the largest private residential mortgage insurer in Canada and an indirect subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. (the "Corporation"), completed the initial public offering (the "Offering") of its common shares (the "Common Shares"). Of the 44,740,000 Common Shares of Genworth Canada that were sold in the Offering, 5,100,000 Common Shares were sold by Genworth Canada and 39,640,000 Common Shares were sold by Brookfield Life Assurance Company Limited (the "Selling Shareholder"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. Following completion of the Offering, the Corporation beneficially owns 61.8% of the Common Shares. In addition, the Selling Shareholder has granted to the underwriters of the Offering an option (the "Over-Allotment Option"), exercisable for a period of 30 days after the closing of the Offering, to purchase up to an additional 6,711,000 Common Shares from the Selling Shareholder. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the Corporation will beneficially own 56.1% of the Common Shares.
At an exchange rate of 0.88 United States dollars to 1 Canadian dollar (which differs from the exchange rate used in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements), the Offering generated net proceeds to the Corporation of approximately US$634 million (net of expenses directly related to the transaction, including underwriting commissions, taxes and other items) which excludes US$22 million remaining in Genworth Canada. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the Corporation will receive additional net proceeds of approximately US$97 million.
Concurrently with the completion of the Offering, the Corporation, Genworth Canada, Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Company Canada ("Genworth Mortgage Insurance Canada") and the Selling Shareholder entered into a master agreement (the "Master Agreement"), which provides the overall framework for the Offering and the Corporation's reduced ownership interest in Genworth Mortgage Insurance Canada's business (the "Business"). The Master Agreement contemplates that certain aspects relating to the Offering and the reduction in the Corporation's interest in the Business and various interim and ongoing relationships between the Corporation and Genworth Canada will be governed by the Master Agreement and certain other agreements between the Corporation and Genworth Canada (collectively, the "IPO Agreements").
Master Agreement
The Master Agreement sets out the key arrangements between the Corporation and Genworth Canada with respect to the Offering and the Corporation's reduced ownership interest in the Business. The principal provisions of the Master Agreement are discussed below.
Indemnification and Release
Each of Genworth Canada and the Corporation agreed to indemnify the other and its respective directors, officers and employees with respect to any and all liabilities or claims arising out of, resulting from or otherwise related to: (1) failure by such party to perform or otherwise properly discharge any liabilities, whether prior to or after the closing of the Offering; (2) the business conducted by such party; (3) any breach of any IPO Agreement by such party; and (4) information contained in the Offering prospectus and any other materials distributed in connection with the Offering or the transactions contemplated in the IPO Agreements, and any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, other than with respect to statements or omissions relating exclusively to the respective party and its businesses.
Subject to the indemnities described above, Genworth Canada and the Corporation also released each other and their respective directors, officers and employees from any and all liabilities existing or arising from any acts, events or conditions occurring or existing on or before the time immediately prior to the closing of the Offering.
 
Non-competition and Non-solicitation
The Master Agreement contains non-competition covenants that will prohibit, subject to certain limited exceptions, competition between Genworth Canada and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Corporation and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, in certain businesses and geographic areas during the period beginning on the date of such agreement and ending on the date that is two years after the date on which the Corporation ceases to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least one-third of the outstanding Common Shares (the "Restricted Period").
In addition, during the Restricted Period, (i) Genworth Canada and its subsidiaries may not solicit to hire, employ, retain or contract for service any employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries above a specified employment level or encourage any such individual to terminate his or her employment, and (ii) the Corporation and its subsidiaries (for so long as they are subsidiaries of the Corporation) may not solicit to hire, employ, retain or contract for service any executive officer of Genworth Canada or any of its subsidiaries or encourage any such individual to terminate his or her employment as an executive officer. These non-solicitation agreements are subject to certain customary exceptions, including for solicitations of a general nature such as advertising.
Shareholder Agreement
The Corporation, the Selling Shareholder and Genworth Canada also entered into a Shareholder Agreement concurrently with the closing of the Offering.
Special Approval Rights of the Corporation
For so long as the Corporation beneficially owns not less than one-third of the outstanding Common Shares, Genworth Canada is required to seek the prior written consent of the Corporation (the "Approval Right") to take certain actions, whether directly or indirectly through a subsidiary, including: (a) entering into any merger or similar business combination; (b) acquiring or disposing of assets, subject to certain exceptions; (c) adopting a liquidation, reorganization, recapitalization or similar plan relating to Genworth Canada or any of its subsidiaries; (d) reducing the dividend policy of Genworth Canada or its subsidiaries, except as required by law; and (e) issuing debt securities or incurring indebtedness or guarantees unless such issuance or incurrence is in compliance with certain financial covenants.
For so long as the Corporation beneficially owns not less than 50% of the outstanding Common Shares, Genworth Canada is required to seek the prior written consent of the Corporation to take certain actions, whether directly or indirectly through a subsidiary, including: (a) approving any annual business plan of Genworth Canada and its subsidiaries, including material amendments; (b) appointing or removing the Chief Executive Officer of Genworth Canada and (c) issuing equity securities or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for equity securities of Genworth Canada (other than pursuant to executive compensation plans approved by Genworth Canada's Board of Directors).
If the Corporation beneficially owns less than 50% of the outstanding Common Shares, then, for so long as the Corporation beneficially owns not less than one-third of the Common Shares, Genworth Canada is required to consult with the Corporation with respect to the foregoing matters; however, the Corporation no longer has the right to approve or deny approval of such matters.
For so long as the Corporation beneficially owns not less than 15% of the Common Shares, Genworth Canada may not implement or adopt any shareholder rights plan without the approval of the Corporation, unless the plan includes an exception that would permit a purchase of all or part of the Common Shares beneficially owned by the Corporation without causing the rights thereunder to separate from the Common Shares or become exercisable or otherwise triggering the plan.
 
Information Sharing
The Corporation expects that it will be required to consolidate Genworth Canada's financial results in its own for so long as it beneficially owns a majority of the Common Shares, and thereafter will be required to account for its investment in Genworth Canada using the equity method while it owns a significant number of Common Shares. Accordingly, the Shareholder Agreement includes covenants by Genworth Canada, for so long as the Corporation beneficially owns more than 50% of the Common Shares or is required to consolidate the financial results of Genworth Canada, relating to the consolidation of Genworth Canada's financial results and other financial and accounting matters.
In addition, for so long as the Corporation beneficially owns at least 20% of the Common Shares, Genworth Canada agreed to provide to the Corporation certain financial and other information, including financial information required for the Corporation's quarterly and annual financial statements, MD&A and other public filings, and to take certain actions relating to the preparation and disclosure of Genworth Canada's financial results.
Pre-emptive Right
The Corporation has the right (the "Pre-emptive Right"), subject to applicable law, exercisable for so long as the Corporation beneficially owns not less than one-third of the outstanding Common Shares, to participate in future offerings and other issuances of Common Shares or securities convertible into Common Shares (subject to certain exceptions) in order to maintain its relative beneficial ownership interest of Common Shares.
Committee Representation
The Shareholder Agreement provides that, for so long as the Corporation beneficially owns at least one-third of the Common Shares, the Corporation will be entitled to designate one member of each committee of Genworth Canada's Board of Directors.
Director Elections and Nominations
In connection with the Offering, the Corporation was issued a special share (the "Special Share") which grants the Corporation the right to nominate and elect a certain number of directors to Genworth Canada's Board of Directors, as determined by the number of Common Shares that the Corporation and its affiliates beneficially own at the time of such nomination and election. The Shareholder Agreement also provides that if the Special Share is redeemed upon demand by the Corporation, Genworth Canada will nominate for election as directors of Genworth Canada at any meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected, a number of persons designated by the Corporation equal to the number of directors that the Corporation would have been entitled to elect at such meeting had the Special Share remained outstanding.

Contribution
(a) If the indemnification provided for in this Article VI is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless on an After-Tax Basis, an indemnified party under Section 6.02(d) or Section 6.04(d) hereof in respect of any Liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the actions which resulted in Liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(b) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.05 were determined by a pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (a) above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Liabilities referred to in paragraph (a), above, shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating any claim or defending any Action. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
SECTION 6.06 .
Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts, On an After-Tax Basis
(a) Any Liability subject to indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Article VI will be net of Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of the Liability and will be determined on an After-Tax Basis. Accordingly, the amount which any party (an "") is required to pay to any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "") will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds theretofore actually recovered by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of the related Liability. If an Indemnified Party receives a payment (an "") required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Liability and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds, then the Indemnified Party will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the Insurance Proceeds had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made.
Indemnifying Party
Indemnified Party
Indemnity Payment
(b) An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto. The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek to collect or recover any third-party Insurance Proceeds (other than Insurance Proceeds under an arrangement where future premiums are adjusted to reflect prior claims in excess of prior premiums) to which the Indemnified Party is entitled in connection with any Liability for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to this Article VI; provided that the Indemnified Party's inability to collect or recover any such Insurance Proceeds shall not limit the Indemnifying Party's obligations hereunder.
(c) The term "" as used in this Article VI means that, in determining the amount of the payment necessary to indemnify any party against, or reimburse any party for, Liabilities, the amount of such Liabilities will be determined net of any reduction in Tax derived by the indemnified party as the result of sustaining or paying such Liabilities, and the amount of such indemnification payment will be increased (i.e., "grossed up") by the amount necessary to satisfy any income or other Tax liabilities incurred by the indemnified party as a result of its receipt of, or right to receive, such indemnification payment (as so increased), so that the indemnified party is put in the same net after-Tax economic position as if it had not incurred such Liabilities, in each case without taking into account any impact on the tax basis that an indemnified party has in its assets.

SECTION 6.07 .
Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party Claims
(a) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a Person (including any Governmental Authority) who is not a party or one of its Affiliates of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action (collectively, a "") with respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 6.02, 6.03 or 6.04, or any other Section of this Agreement or any other IPO Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof within 10 days after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim. Any such notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail.
Third Party Claim
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of any Indemnified Party or other Person to give notice as provided in this Section 6.07(a) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article VI or under the indemnification provisions of any other IPO Agreement, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice.
(b) An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend (and to seek to settle or compromise), at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel, any Third Party Claim. Within 60 days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnified Party in accordance with Section 6.07(a) (or sooner, if the nature of such Third Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third Party Claim, which election shall specify any reservations or exceptions. During such time, the Indemnified Party shall not take any action that could prejudice the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend the Third Party Claim. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnified Party except as set forth in the next sentence. If the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then, in any such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, but the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to reimbursement by the Indemnified Party for payment of any such fees and expenses to the extent that it establishes that such reservations and exceptions were proper.
(c) If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnified Party of its election as provided in Section 6.07(b), such Indemnified Party may defend such Third Party Claim at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.
(d) Unless the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, no Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any pending or threatened Third Party Claim in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party without the consent of the Indemnified Party if (i) the effect thereof is to permit any injunction, declaratory judgment, other order or other nonmonetary relief to be entered, directly or indirectly against such Indemnified Party and (ii) such settlement does not include an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Third Party Claim.
 
SECTION 6.08 .
Additional Matters
(a) Indemnification or contribution payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Article VI or under any other IPO Agreement shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party as such Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the Indemnified Party, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification or contribution payment, including documentation with respect to calculations made on an After-Tax Basis and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of such Liabilities. The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article VI or under any other IPO Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party; (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnified Party of Liabilities for which it might be entitled to indemnification or contribution hereunder; and (iii) any termination of this Agreement or any other IPO Agreement.
(b) Any claim on account of a Liability which does not result from a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnified Party to the applicable Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30 days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to make payment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this Agreement and the other IPO Agreements without prejudice to its continuing rights to pursue indemnification or contribution hereunder or thereunder.
(c) If payment is made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified Party may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third Party Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.
(d) In an Action in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party shall so request, the parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant if they conclude that substitution is desirable and practical. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow the Indemnifying Party to manage the Action as set forth in this section, and the Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the named defendant against all costs of defending the Action (including court costs, sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys' fees, experts fees and all other external expenses), the costs of any judgment or settlement, and the cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement.
SECTION 6.09 . The rights provided in this Article VI shall be cumulative and, subject to the provisions of Article VII, shall not preclude assertion by any Indemnified Party of any other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against any Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Genworth Financial nor Genworth Mortgage Insurance Canada shall be liable to the other for any special, indirect, incidental, punitive, consequential, exemplary, statutorily-enhanced or
Remedies Cumulative; Limitations of Liability
 
similar damages in excess of compensatory damages (provided that any such liability with respect to a Third Party Claim shall be considered direct damages) of the other in connection with this Agreement or the other IPO Agreements.

Prior to the Trigger Date, Genworth Financial will use its commercially reasonable efforts to include Genworth Mortgage Insurance Canada in the settlement of any Third Party Claim which jointly involves Genworth Financial and Genworth Mortgage Insurance Canada; , , that Genworth Mortgage Insurance Canada shall be responsible for its share of any such settlement obligation and any incremental cost (as reasonably determined by Genworth Financial) to Genworth Financial of including Genworth Mortgage Insurance Canada in such settlement; , , that Genworth Mortgage Insurance Canada shall be permitted in good faith to opt out of any settlement if Genworth Mortgage Insurance Canada agrees to be responsible for defending its share of such Third Party Claim. The parties agree to cooperate in the defense and settlement of any such Third Party Claim which primarily relates to matters, actions, events or occurrences taking place prior to the Trigger Date. In addition, both Genworth Mortgage Insurance Canada and Genworth Financial will use their commercially reasonable efforts to make the necessary filings to permit each party to defend its own interests in any such Third Party Claim as of the Trigger Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter.

The pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and for the year ended December 31, 2008 are based on the assumption that the Offering was completed on January 1, 2008.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented do not purport to present what the Corporation's results of operations or financial position actually would have been had the Offering been completed on the dates noted above, or to project the Corporation's results of operations for any future periods. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that the Corporation believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates. The pro forma results should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a) Adjustments reflect the impact from the Offering of 44,740,000 common shares of Genworth Canada, an indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, which was completed on July 7, 2009. Of the 44,740,000 common shares of Genworth Canada that were sold in the Offering, 5,100,000 common shares were sold by Genworth Canada, and 39,640,000 common shares were sold by Brookfield Life Assurance Company Limited (the "Selling Shareholder"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. Following completion of the Offering, the Corporation beneficially owns 61.8% of the common shares of Genworth Canada.
In addition, the Selling Shareholder has granted to the underwriters of the Offering an option (the "Over-Allotment Option"), for a period of 30 days after the closing of the Offering, to purchase up to an additional 6,711,000 common shares from the Selling Shareholder. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the Corporation will beneficially own 56.1% of the common shares of Genworth Canada. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option.
(b) Adjustment reflects the net proceeds received in Canadian dollars by the Corporation in conjunction with the sale of 44,740,000 shares of Genworth Canada's common stock at the March 31, 2009 exchange rate of 0.7946 United States dollar to 1 Canadian dollar. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the Corporation will receive additional net proceeds of $89 million for a total adjustment of $685 million. Proceeds are net of expenses directly related to the Offering, including underwriting commissions, taxes and other items, and assumes these expenses were paid in cash on March 31, 2009.
(c) Adjustment reflects a change in deferred taxes for the 38.2% noncontrolling interests in Genworth Canada in conjunction with the Offering. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, noncontrolling interests will be 43.9% and the adjustment would be $40 million.
(d) Adjustment reflects the difference between the net proceeds received, adjustments to deferred taxes and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the 38.2% noncontrolling interests in Genworth Canada following the Offering. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, noncontrolling interests will be 43.9% and the adjustment would be $(99) million.
(e) Adjustment reflects the 38.2% noncontrolling interests in Genworth Canada's net unrealized investment gains (losses) in conjunction with the Offering. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, noncontrolling interests will be 43.9% and the adjustment would remain at $(3) million.
(f) Adjustment reflects the 38.2% noncontrolling interests in Genworth Canada's foreign currency translation in conjunction with the Offering. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, noncontrolling interests will be 43.9% and the adjustment would be $32 million.
(g) Adjustment reflects the 38.2% noncontrolling interests in Genworth Canada in conjunction with the Offering. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, noncontrolling interests will be 43.9% and the adjustment would be $795 million.
(h) Adjustment reflects a reduction in the provision for income taxes as a result of lower U.S. taxes on foreign income for the three months ended March 31, 2009 in conjunction with the Offering. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, noncontrolling interests will be 43.9% and the adjustment would remain at $(3) million.
(i) Adjustment reflects the 38.2% noncontrolling interests in Genworth Canada's net income for the three months ended March 31, 2009 in conjunction with the Offering. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, noncontrolling interests will be 43.9% and the adjustment would be $(25) million.
 
(j) Adjustment reflects a reduction in the provision for income taxes as a result of lower U.S. taxes on foreign income for the year ended December 31, 2008 in conjunction with the Offering. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, noncontrolling interests will be 43.9% and the adjustment would be $(12) million.
(k) Adjustment reflects the 38.2% noncontrolling interests in Genworth Canada's net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 in conjunction with the Offering. If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, noncontrolling interests will be 43.9% and the adjustment would be $(151) million.
