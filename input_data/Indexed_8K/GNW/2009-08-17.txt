(2) Accounting Pronouncements
Recently adopted
Subsequent Events
On June 30, 2009, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 165, . This statement establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. It requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. The adoption of SFAS No. 165 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Subsequent Events
Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments
On April 1, 2009, we adopted FASB Staff Position ("FSP") FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2,. This FSP amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and modifies the presentation and disclosure requirements for other-than-temporary impairment disclosures for debt and equity securities. The FSP amends the requirement for management to positively assert the ability and intent to hold a debt security to recovery to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment exists and replaces this provision with the assertion that we do not intend to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security prior to recovery. Additionally, the FSP modifies the presentation of other-than-temporary impairments for certain debt securities to only present the impairment loss in net income that represents the credit loss associated with the other-than-temporary impairment with the remaining impairment loss being presented in other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI"). As of April 1, 2009, we recorded a net cumulative effect adjustment of $865,332 to retained earnings with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments On Available-For-Sale Securities
As of each balance sheet date, we evaluate securities in an unrealized loss position for other-than-temporary impairments. For debt securities, we consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. Estimating the cash flows expected to be collected is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with certain internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral. Where possible, this data is benchmarked against third-party sources.
Prior to adoption of FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 on April 1, 2009, we generally recognized an other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities in an unrealized loss position when we did not expect full recovery of value or did not have the intent and ability to hold such securities until they had fully recovered their amortized cost. The recognition of other-than-temporary impairments prior to April 1, 2009 represented the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value with this difference being recorded in net income as an adjustment to the amortized cost of the security.
Beginning on April 1, 2009, we recognize other-than-temporary impairments on debt securities in an unrealized loss position when one of the following circumstances exists:
 
 
 
Total other-than-temporary impairments are calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and fair value. For other-than-temporarily impaired securities where we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery, total other-than-temporary impairments are adjusted by the portion of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in OCI ("non-credit"). Net other-than-temporary impairments recorded in net income represent the credit loss on the other-than-temporarily impaired securities with the offset recorded as an adjustment to the amortized cost to determine the new amortized cost basis of the securities. For other-than-temporary impairments recognized during the period, we present the total other-than-temporary impairments, the portion of other-than-temporary impairments included in OCI and the net other-than-temporary impairments as supplemental disclosure presented on the face of our consolidated statements of income.
For securities that were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired and a non-credit loss was recorded in OCI, the amount recorded as an unrealized gain (loss) represents the difference between the current fair value and the new amortized cost for each period presented. The unrealized gain (loss) on an other-than-temporarily impaired security is recorded in OCI until the security is sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recorded for the entire unrealized loss.
To estimate the amount of other-than-temporary impairment attributed to credit losses on debt securities where we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery, we determine our best estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from a security by discounting these cash flows by the current effective yield on the security prior to recording any other-than-temporary impairment. If the present value of the discounted cash flows is lower than the amortized cost of the security, the difference between the present value and amortized cost represents the credit loss associated with the security with the remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost recorded as a non-credit other-than-temporary impairment in OCI.
The evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine the appropriate amount and timing for recognizing an impairment charge. The assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management's best estimate of the

cash flows expected to be collected at the individual security level. We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that securities that may be other-than-temporarily impaired are identified in a timely manner and that any impairment charge is recognized in the proper period.
Net Investment Income
Sources of net investment income for the periods presented were as follows:
 
Net Investment Gains (Losses)
The following table sets forth net investment gains (losses) for the periods indicated:
 
The aggregate fair value of securities sold at a loss during the three months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 was $3 million and $21 million, respectively, which was approximately 97% and 99%, respectively, of book value. The aggregate fair value of securities sold at a loss during the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 was $3 million and $39 million, respectively, which was approximately 97% and 99%, respectively, of book value.

Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses
Net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities classified as available-for-sale are reduced by deferred income taxes that would have resulted had such gains and losses been realized. Net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities reflected as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of the dates indicated were as follows:
 
The change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the periods indicated was as follows:
 
Fixed Maturity Securities
As of June 30, 2009, the amortized cost or cost, gross unrealized gains (losses) and fair value of the fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale were as follows:

As of December 31, 2008, the amortized cost or cost, gross unrealized gains (losses) and fair value of the fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale were as follows:
 
 
The following table presents the gross unrealized losses and fair values of investment securities, aggregated by investment type and length of time that individual investment securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, as of June 30, 2009:
 
The investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2009 consisted of 78 securities and accounted for unrealized losses of $24 million. Of these unrealized losses of $24 million, 83% were investment grade (rated AAA through BBB). The unrealized losses on these securities have decreased since 2008 mainly due to increased bond prices and lower cash rates. No unrealized losses on other-than-temporarily impaired securities were included in these unrealized losses as of June 30, 2009.
 
Table of Contents
 
Of the investment securities in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more as of June 30, 2009, three securities were 20% or more below cost, of which one security was also below investment grade (rated BB+ and below) and accounted for unrealized losses of $2 million. This security was issued by a corporation in the finance and insurance sector. There were no other-than-temporarily impaired securities with a non-credit loss recorded in OCI.
While certain securities included in the chart above were considered other-than-temporarily impaired, we expected to recover the new amortized cost based on our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. As of June 30, 2009, we expect to recover our amortized cost on the securities included in the chart above and do not intend to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovering our amortized cost.
We expect our investments in corporate securities will continue to perform in accordance with our conclusions about the amount and timing of estimated cash flows. Although we do not anticipate such events, it is at least reasonably possible that issuers of our investments in corporate securities will perform worse than current expectations. Such events may lead us to recognize potential future write-downs within our portfolio of corporate securities.

The scheduled maturity distribution of fixed maturity securities as of June 30, 2009 is set forth below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers of securities may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
 
As of June 30, 2009, $129 million of investments were subject to certain call provisions. Typically, call provisions provide the issuer the ability to redeem a security, prior to its stated maturity, at or above par.
Investment Concentrations
As of June 30, 2009, securities issued by finance and insurance industry groups and foreign state government represented approximately 43% and 7%, respectively, of the corporate fixed maturity securities portfolio held by the Company.
As of June 30, 2009, the Company held $266 million in corporate fixed maturity securities issued by the New South Wales Treasury Corporation, which comprised of 21% of total stockholder's equity. Additionally, the Company held $206 million in corporate fixed maturity securities issued by Queensland Treasury Corp and $147 million in corporate fixed maturity securities issued by Treasury Corporation of Victoria, which comprised of 16% and 12%, respectively, of total stockholder's equity. No other single issuer exceeded 10% of total stockholder's equity.
(4) Fair Value Measurements
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
We hold fixed maturity securities which are carried at fair value. The vast majority of our fixed maturity securities use Level 2 inputs for the determination of fair value. These fair values are obtained primarily from industry-standard pricing methodologies based on market observable information. We also utilize internally developed pricing models to produce estimates of fair value primarily utilizing Level 2 inputs along with certain Level 3 inputs. The internally developed models include matrix pricing where we discount expected cash flows utilizing market interest rates obtained from market sources based on the credit quality and duration of the instrument to determine fair value. For securities that may not be reliably priced using internally developed pricing models, we estimate fair value using indicative market prices. These prices are indicative of an exit price, but the assumptions used to establish the fair value may not be observable, or corroborated by market observable information, and represent Level 3 inputs.

The following tables set forth our assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated:

The following tables present additional information about assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and for which we have utilized significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs to determine fair value as of or for the dates indicated:
 
Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on Level 3 assets and liabilities are primarily reported in either net investment gains (losses) within the condensed consolidated statements of income or OCI within stockholders' equity based on the appropriate accounting treatment for the instrument.
Purchases, sales, issuances and settlements, net, represent the activity that occurred during the period that results in a change of the asset or liability but does not represent changes in fair value for the instruments held at the beginning of the period. Such activity consists of purchases and sales of fixed maturity securities.
The amount presented for unrealized gains (losses) for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents accretion on certain fixed maturity securities which were recorded in net investment gains (losses).
(5) Statutory Accounting
Genworth Mortgage prepares financial statements for its regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ("APRA") in accordance with the accounting practices prescribed by the regulator, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP. The main differences were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
 
The Company's APRA net income after tax, capital base, minimum capital requirement and solvency ratio as of and for the year ended December 31 were as follows:
 
The APRA solvency ratio is the combined amounts of Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Genworth Financial Mortgage Indemnity Limited.
Under the prudential regulation framework in Australia, mortgage insurers are required to establish a catastrophic risk charge defined as a 1 in 250 year event. The Company is required to maintain adequate capital to fund this charge, in addition to normal insurance liabilities, by ensuring that its capital base exceeds its minimum capital requirement at all times.
As of June 30, 2009, the APRA solvency ratio was 1.29.
The Company's ability to pay dividends to Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Holdings Pty Ltd is restricted to the extent the payment of dividends exceeds current year income. Any dividend above this level requires prior approval from APRA. In addition, any dividend payment must result in the Company continuing to meet the APRA minimum capital requirement.
