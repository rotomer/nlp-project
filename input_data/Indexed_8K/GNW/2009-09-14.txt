Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2 below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As previously reported, one of our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries was involved in an arbitration proceeding with a lender regarding five bulk transactions (reflecting approximately $531 million of original risk in-force) that, until their rescission by our insurance subsidiary in December 2008, had insured certain of such lender's payment option adjustable rate loans ("POA").
On September 8, 2009, the parties settled the arbitration. The settlement resolves prior claims, or pending and anticipated future unpaid claims for coverage benefits under the policies for the POA loans, and the lender's bad faith counterclaims. The parties mutually release each other and their affiliates to end all disputes or potential disputes that were raised or could have been raised in the arbitration. After giving effect to the premiums retained, settlement payments and other consideration exchanged by the parties, we have made an additional provision for our obligations under the settlement in the amount of approximately $65 million, net of tax.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
