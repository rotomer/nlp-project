Notice of Transaction
 
(iii) . In the event the requirements of Section 2(c) of this Article IV are not complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either cause the closing of the transaction to be postponed until such time as the requirements of Section 2(c) of this Article IV have been complied with, or cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice referred to in Section 2(c)(ii) of this Article IV.
Effect of Noncompliance

4. . The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as set forth in this Section 4 (the "Conversion Rights"). The shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into shares of Class B Common Stock, as set forth in this Section 4.
Conversion
 
(a) . Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock. Each share of Series A or Series A-1 Preferred shall be convertible into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class B Common Stock, which results from dividing the per share Series A Conversion Value (as hereinafter defined) by the Series A Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of conversion. Each share of Series B or Series B-1 Preferred shall be convertible into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class B Common Stock, which results from dividing the per share Series B Conversion Value (as hereinafter defined) by the Series B Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of conversion. Each share of Series C or Series C-1 Preferred shall be convertible into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, which results from dividing the per share Series C Conversion Value (as hereinafter defined) by the Series C Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of conversion. Each share of Series D or Series D-1 Preferred shall be convertible into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class B Common Stock, which results from dividing the per share Series D Conversion Value (as hereinafter defined) by the Series D Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of conversion. The per share price as of the date of the filing of this Certificate at which shares of Class B Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of the Series A or Series A-1 Preferred (the "Conversion Price" for each of the Series A and Series A-1 Preferred) shall be $0.0625, and the per share conversion value attributable to the Series A or Series A-1 Preferred shall be $0.0625 (the "Conversion Value" for each of the Series A and Series A-1 Preferred). The per share price as of the date of the filing of this Certificate at which shares of Class B Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of the Series B or Series B-1 Preferred (the "Conversion Price" for each of the Series B and Series B-1 Preferred) shall be $0.49525, and the per share conversion value attributable to the Series B or Series B-1 Preferred shall be $0.49525 (the "Conversion Value" for each of the Series B and Series B-1 Preferred). The per share price as of the date of the filing of this Certificate at which shares of Class B Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of the Series C or Series C-1 Preferred (the "Conversion Price" for each of the Series C and Series C-1 Preferred) shall be $2.3425 and the per share conversion value attributable to the Series C or Series C-1 Preferred shall be $2.3425 (the "Conversion Value" for each of the Series C and Series C-1 Preferred). The per share price as of the date of the filing of this Certificate at which shares of Class B Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of the Series D or Series D-1 Preferred (the "Conversion Price" for the Series D and Series D-1 Preferred) shall be $2.91 and the per share conversion value attributable to the Series D or Series D-1 Preferred shall be $2.91 (the "Conversion Value" for the Series D and Series D-1 Preferred). The Conversion Price for each of the Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1, Series C, Series C-1, Series D and Series D-1 Preferred shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock into which a share of a series of Preferred Stock is convertible is hereinafter referred to as the "Conversion Rate" for such share.
Right to Convert
 
(b) . Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Class B Common Stock at its then effective Conversion Rate immediately prior to the closing of the sale of Common Stock of the Corporation in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offering and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation to the public (an "IPO") at a price per share (prior to underwriter commissions and offering expenses) of not less than $2.3425 (appropriately adjusted for Recapitalizations) and at an aggregate offering price to the public of not less than $15,000,000. In the event of the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock upon a public offering as described above, the person(s) entitled to receive the Class B Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the IPO. Each share of Preferred Stock also shall be automatically converted into shares of Class B Common Stock, at its then effective Conversion Rate upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock.
Automatic Conversion
 
(c) . Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Class B Common Stock and receive certificates therefor, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 4(b) of this Article IV, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, and provided further that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Class B Common Stock, issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class B Common Stock, to which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, as set forth in Section 4(i) of this Article IV. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, or in the case of automatic conversion as provided in Section 4(b) of this Article IV, such conversion shall be deemed to occur as set forth in Section 4(b) of this Article IV, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Class B Common Stock on such date.
Mechanics of Conversion

No Adjustment for Conversion Price
 
(iii) . In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of filing of this Certificate shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities then entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein designed to protect against dilution) of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:
Deemed Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
 
(A) no further adjustment in any Conversion Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of the Options or Convertible Securities or shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;
 
(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation, or decrease or increase in the number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities (provided, however, that no such adjustment of any Conversion Price shall affect Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock previously issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, if any);
 
(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:
 
(1) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the Conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration actually
 
received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange; and
 
(2) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v) of this Article IV) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;
 
(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall have the effect of increasing any Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (a) the Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (b) the Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.
 
(iv) .
Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
 
(A) In the event the Corporation, at any time after the date of the filing of this Certificate, shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) of this Article IV) without consideration or for consideration per share less than the Conversion Price of the Series A, Series B, Series C or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the Conversion Price of such Series A, Series B, Series C or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to the Conversion Price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) determined by dividing (X) an amount equal to the sum of (1) the product derived by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale times the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (2) the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation upon such issue or sale, by (Y) an amount equal to the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (2) the number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to have been issued in such issue and sale. For the purposes of the calculations set forth in this Section 4(d)(iv), the number of shares of "Common Stock Outstanding" at any time shall be equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding at such time plus the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock issuable upon the exercise and/or conversion of all Options and Convertible Securities then outstanding.
 
(B) From and after such time as any share of Series A-1 Preferred is issued and outstanding, the Conversion Price for the Series A-1 Preferred shall be the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and shall not thereafter be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)(A) of this Article IV. From and after such time as any share of Series B-1 Preferred is issued and outstanding, the Conversion Price for the Series B-1 Preferred shall be the Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and shall not thereafter be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)(A) of this Article IV. From and after such time as any share of Series C-1 Preferred is issued and outstanding, the Conversion Price for the Series C-1 Preferred shall be the Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and shall not thereafter be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)(A) of this Article IV. From and after such time as any share of Series D-1 Preferred is issued and outstanding, the Conversion Price for the Series D-1 Preferred shall be the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and shall not thereafter be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)(A) of this Article IV.
 
(v) . The consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) of this Article IV, relating to Options and Convertible Securities shall be determined by dividing:
Determination of Consideration for Options and Convertible Securities
 
(A) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to protect against dilution, but excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by
 
(B) the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to protect against the dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.
 
If the consideration is not cash or such instrument does not specify the value of the additional consideration such consideration shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment.
 
(e) . In the event the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, reclassification or otherwise) at any time after the filing of this Certificate into a greater number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.
Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidation of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
 
(f) . If the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock or other securities or property, whether by reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Section 4(e) of this Article IV), the Conversion Price for each series then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock which the holders thereof would otherwise have been entitled to receive upon such conversion, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock or other securities or property equivalent to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, that would have been issuable to the holders of Preferred Stock if their shares of Preferred Stock had been converted immediately before such change; and, in any such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock, to
Adjustments for Reorganization, Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution
 
the end that the provisions set forth herein (including the provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the applicable Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.
 
(g) . In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 4(e) of this Article IV, then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(g), the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.
Other Distributions
 
(h) . The Corporation will not through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of Section 4 of this Article IV and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment. This provision shall not restrict the Corporation's right to amend its Certificate with the requisite stockholder consent.
No Impairment
 
(i) . No fractional shares of Class B Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of a share of Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, as determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Class B Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4 of this Article IV, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) all such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price for such series at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Class B Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of such holder's shares of Preferred Stock.
No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments
 
(j) . In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.
Notices of Record Date
 
(k) . The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class B Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock such number of its shares of Class
Reservation of Common Stock Issuable Upon Conversion
 
B Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Class B Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class B Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.
 
(l) . Any notice required by the provisions of Section 4 of this Article IV to be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given three (3) days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the Corporation.
Notices
 
5. . Until such time as all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock have been converted to Class B Common Stock pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article IV, Section 4(b) of this Certificate and in addition to any other rights provided by law, the Corporation shall not, without first obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class:
Protective Covenants
 
(a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Corporation's Certificate or Bylaws if such action would materially or adversely alter or change the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or the restrictions provided for the benefit of the Preferred Stock, or increase or decrease the number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized hereby;
 
(b) authorize or issue or obligate itself to issue, shares of any class or series of stock having any preference or priority as to voting, dividends or upon liquidation which are superior to any such preference or priority of the Preferred Stock;
 
(c) authorize or issue shares of stock of any class or series of any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations convertible into or exchangeable for, or having option rights to purchase, any shares of stock of this Corporation having any preference or priority as to voting, dividends or upon liquidation which are superior to any such preference or priority of the Preferred Stock;
 
(d) reclassify any class or series of any Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock into shares having any preference or priority as to voting, dividends or upon liquidation which are superior to any such preference or priority any series of Preferred Stock;
 
(e) effect a transaction described in Section 2(c) of this Article IV; or
 
(f) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1, Series C, Series C-1, Series D or Series D-1 Preferred Stock.
 
6. . In the event any shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted pursuant to Section 4 of this Article IV, the shares so converted shall be cancelled and shall not be issuable by the Corporation. The Certificate shall be appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in the Corporation's authorized capital stock.
Status of Converted Stock
 
7. .
Special Mandatory Conversion
 
(a) If, at any time following the Original Issue Date of the Series C Preferred and until such time as all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock have been converted to Class B Common Stock pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article IV, Section 4(b) of this Certificate, (i) each and every holder of Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D Preferred Stock has a Right of First Offer with respect to an equity financing by the Corporation (the "Equity Financing"), (ii) the Corporation has complied with its obligations with respect to the Right of First Offer relating to the Equity Financing, and (iii) any holder of shares of Series A, Series B, Series C or Series D Preferred Stock or any holder of securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock does not by exercise of such holder's Right of First Offer acquire the amount of securities offered in such Equity Financing to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the Right of First Offer, then, effective immediately prior to the consummation of such Equity Financing, (A) if the Equity Financing was at a price per share less than the original issue price for the Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted for Recapitalizations), then all of such holder's shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically and without further action on the part of such holder be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, (B) if the Equity Financing was at a price per share less than the original issue price for the Series B Preferred Stock (as adjusted for Recapitalizations), then all of such holder's shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall automatically and without further action on the part of such holder be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, (C) if the Equity Financing was at a price per share less than the original issue price for the Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for Recapitalizations), then all such holder's shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall automatically and without further action on the part of such holder be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock, and (D) if the Equity Financing was at a price per share less than the original issue price for the Series D Preferred Stock (and, in the case securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock were issued prior to the first issuance of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock, a price per share less than the original conversion or exercise price of the first such convertible or exercisable securities issued) (as adjusted for Recapitalizations), then all such holder's shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall automatically and without further action on the part of such holder be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock (and with respect to securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock, all of such holder's securities convertible or exercisable for Series D Preferred Stock shall become convertible or exercisable into shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to their terms); provided, however, that no such conversion shall occur in connection with a particular Equity Financing if, pursuant to the written request of the Corporation, the Right of First Offer with respect to such Equity Financing is waived with respect to every holder of Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D Preferred Stock and securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock. Upon conversion pursuant to this Section 7, the shares of Series A, Series B, Series C or Series D Preferred Stock so converted shall be canceled and not subject to reissuance. The "Agreement" means that certain Second Amended and Restated Co-Sale, Right of First Refusal and Right of First Offer Agreement among the Corporation, the holders of the Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D Preferred Stock, the holder of securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock and certain founders of the Corporation, as such agreement may from time to time be amended. A "Right of First Offer" means the right to participate in a sale and issuance of equity securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities of the Corporation) of the Corporation on a pro rata basis (according to Preferred Stock stockholdings and/or holdings of shares issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase Series D Preferred); provided that, if a stockholder has a pro rata right to participate in an Equity Financing that calculates the pro rata right based on shares of Preferred Stock and/or shares issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase Series D Preferred as well as shares of additional securities, options and/or rights held by the stockholder (such additional securities, options and/or rights, the "Additional Securities") such stockholder shall, be deemed to have a Right of First Offer because the stockholder has a right to participate based on shares of Preferred Stock and/or shares issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase Series D Preferred held (notwithstanding that such stockholder has a right to participate based on the Additional Securities held), and, for purposes of this Section 7(a), the Right of First Offer shall mean that level of participation that is determined based on the shares of Preferred Stock and/or shares issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase Series D Preferred that such stockholder holds.
 
(b) The holder of any shares of Series A, Series B, Series C or Series D Preferred Stock or securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock converted pursuant to this Section 7 shall deliver to the Corporation during regular business hours at the office of any transfer agent of the Corporation for such series of Preferred Stock, or at such other place as may be designated by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates representing the shares or securities so converted, duly endorsed or assigned in blank or to the Corporation.
