Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  February 1, 2005  Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2004.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Google had an exceptional quarter. Revenues and profits increased significantly, our execution was solid across the company and most importantly, our relationship with our users, partners and advertisers became even stronger," said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive officer. "All of this happened while we continued to innovate, expand around the world and make strategic, long-term investments."
 
Q4 Financial Highlights
 
Revenues in the quarter totaled a record $1.032 billion, representing a 28% increase over the third quarter of 2004 and a 101% year-over-year increase. This revenues growth reflects strong traffic and monetization growth in the quarter as well as advertisers' growing recognition of the Internet as an effective advertising medium.
Revenues -
 
Google-owned sites generated $530 million or 51% of total revenues. This represents an increase of 118% over the fourth quarter of 2003.
Google-Sites Revenues
-
 
Revenues generated on Google's partner sites, through AdSense programs, contributed $490 million, or 48% of total revenues, a 92% increase over the Network revenues generated in the same quarter last year.
The Google Network
-
 
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $378 million or 77% of Google Network revenues. This compares to total payments to partners of $216 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, or 85% of Google Network revenues.
TAC  Traffic Acquisition Costs
 
Income from operations in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, totaled $303 million or 29.4% of revenues, and included a non-cash charge of $60 million for stock-based compensation. This compares to operating income of $86 million or 16.9% of revenues in the same period of 2003, when the stock-based compensation charge was $85 million. This improvement in operating margins was primarily due to decreases in stock-based compensation expense and traffic acquisition cost as a percentage of revenues.
Income from Operations 
 
- Google recorded a provision for income taxes of $106 million in the fourth quarter, an effective tax rate of 34% as compared to a $62 million provision for income taxes and a 70 % effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2003. The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter was reduced by $66 million related to certain items, $42 million due to ISO disqualifying dispositions and $24 million related to certain stock-based compensation charges recognized prior to the IPO. The company expects its effective tax rate before these items to generally trend lower over the long term to a rate below 35%. However, the company may experience volatility in its quarterly effective tax rates as a result of certain stock option activity.
Income Taxes
 
- Net income on a GAAP basis increased to $204 million or 19.8% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2004 as compared to $27 million or 5.3% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2003. Earnings on a diluted per share basis were $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2004 as compared to $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Net Income
Fiscal Year 2004 Financial Highlights
 
- Google reported revenues for calendar year 2004 of $3.189 billion, a 118% increase over the $1.466 billion reported for 2003. Google saw growth throughout the year both in our domestic business and internationally, both on Google owned sites and on the Google Network.
Revenues
 
Specifically, revenues from Google owned sites increased 101% on a year over year basis, from $792 million to $1.6 billion. The company attributes the rapid growth to increased visits to its sites and to its accumulated knowledge of how to more effectively and efficiently monetize that traffic. Revenues from the Google Network grew 147% in the year, from $629 million in 2003 to $1.6 billion in 2004. This growth reflects growth in the number of partners in the network in both the AdSense for Search and the AdSense for Content programs, as well as improved monetization of those programs.
 
 On a GAAP basis (including the settlement charge) our operating income in 2004 rose 87% on a year-over-year basis to $640 million, representing a full year operating margin of 20.1%. Excluding the effect of a third-quarter, 2004 non-cash, non-recurring charge associated with a legal settlement, our operating income for the full year 2004 increased 146% to $841 million, up from $342 million the prior year. Again, excluding the aforementioned charge, our operating margin for the full year rose to 26.4% from 23.4% the previous year. Operating income as reported in both 2004 and 2003 was reduced by significant non-cash stock-based compensation charges of $279 million and $229 million respectively.
Income
from Operations
 
 Net income for the year 2004 rose to $399 million from $106 million in 2003, an increase of 278%. Adjusting for the impact of the third quarter 2004 settlement charge and for certain tax benefits, net income totaled $406 million in 2004. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share increased to $1.46 this year from $0.41 in 2003.
Net Income
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 147% to $977 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 from $395 million in 2003. Free cash flow is an alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities and is calculated as operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $319 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $177 million in the twelve months ended 2003. Free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 totaled $658 million as compared to $219 million for the same period in 2003, an increase of 200%.
Cash Flow
 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before the non-cash stock-based compensation charge, the non-cash and non-recurring settlement charge and in-process R&D. It is another alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $1.280 billion in 2004, or 40% of revenues, from $638 million, or 44% of revenues, in 2003. For the fourth quarter of 2004, adjusted EBITDA increased to $425 million from $321 million in the third quarter. The reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP measure of liquidity, net cash provided by operating activities, is set forth at the back of this release.
Adjusted EBITDA 
 As of December 31, 2004, Google had a cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $2.132 billion.
Cash
 
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 3,021 full time employees as of December 31, 2004, up from 2,668 as of September 30, 2004.

Forward looking statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to the Google's market opportunity and future business prospects. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.

About non-GAAP financial measures.
 
To supplement Google's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses non-GAAP measures of certain financial performance and liquidity. These non-GAAP measures are comprised of income from operations, net income and net income per share before material non-recurring and other items, as well as free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA. Google's management believes that income from operations before material non-recurring and other items and net income before material non-recurring and other items provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the company's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to those core results and are of a substantially non-recurring nature. Google's management believes that free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information regarding liquidity. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Google's ongoing operations and liquidity and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Google's historical operating results and liquidity.
 
Google computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.
