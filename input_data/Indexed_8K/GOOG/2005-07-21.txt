Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  July 21, 2005  Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.
 
"We had an excellent quarter. We continued to innovate, we continued to execute and we stayed focused on our users," said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive officer. "Google had another solid performance."
 
Google reported record revenues of $1.384 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, up 98% year over year. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs or TAC, the portion of revenues shared with partners.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial Highlights
 
Revenues in the second quarter totaled a record $1.384 billion, representing a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2005 and a 98% year-over-year increase. This revenue increase reflects strong traffic and monetization growth in the quarter as well as advertisers' growing recognition of the Internet as an effective advertising medium.
Revenues 
 
Google-owned sites generated $737 million or 53% of total revenues. This represents an increase of 115% over the second quarter of 2004.
Google-Sites Revenues
-
 
Revenues generated on Google's partner sites, through AdSense programs, contributed $630 million, or 46% of total revenues, an 82% increase over the Network revenues generated in the same quarter last year.
The Google Network
-
 
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $494 million. This compares to total payments to partners of $277 million in the second quarter of 2004.
TAC  Traffic Acquisition Costs
 
Income from operations in the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, was $476 million or 34.4% of revenues, and included a non-cash charge of $47 million for stock-based compensation. This compares to income from operations of $171 million or 24.4% of revenues in the second quarter of 2004, when the stock-based compensation charge was $75 million. This improvement in operating margins was primarily because of decreases in TAC, Sales and Marketing expense and stock-based compensation expense as a percentage of revenues, offset by increases in R&D, other cost of revenues and G&A expense.
Income from Operations 
 
 Google recorded a provision for income taxes of $153 million in the second quarter of 2005, an effective tax rate of 31% as compared to a $90 million provision for income taxes and a 53% effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2004. We continue to expect that the effective tax rate for 2005 will be less than 30%. However if future revenues recognized by Google's Irish subsidiary are not as proportionately significant as expected, Google's effective tax rate will be higher than expected.
Income Taxes
 Net income on a GAAP basis increased to $343 million or 24.8% of revenues in the second quarter of 2005 as compared to $79 million or 11.3% of revenues in the second quarter of 2004. Earnings on a per share diluted basis were $1.19 in the second quarter of 2005 as compared to $0.30 in the second quarter of 2004.
Net Income
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 283% to $625 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $163 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004. Free cash flow is an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities and is calculated as operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were approximately $158 million in the three months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to $96 million in the three months ended June 30, 2004. Free cash flow for the three months ended June 30, 2005 totaled $467 million as compared to $67 million for the same period in 2004, an increase of approximately 600%.
Cash Flow
 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, the non-cash stock-based compensation charge and in-process R&D. It is another alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $590 million in the second quarter of 2005 (or 43% of revenues) from $278 million (or 40% of revenues) in the second quarter of 2004.
Adjusted EBITDA 
 
The reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is set forth at the back of this release.
 
 As of June 30, 2005, Google had a cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $2.9 billion.
Cash
 
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 4,183 full time employees as of June 30, 2005, up from 3,482 as of March 31, 2005.

About non-GAAP financial measures.
 
To supplement Google's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Liquidity Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures" set forth at the back of this release.
 
Google's management believes that free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information regarding liquidity. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Google's liquidity and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Google's historical liquidity.
 
Google computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.
