"We are very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter as we achieved excellent performance across our businesses," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google.

Q4 Financial Summary
 
Google reported revenues of $1.919 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 86% compared to the fourth quarter of 2004 and an increase of 22% compared to the third quarter of 2005. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. In the fourth quarter, TAC totaled $629 million, or 33% percent of advertising revenues.

Q4 Financial Highlights
 
Google reported revenues of $1.919 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, representing an 86% increase over fourth quarter 2004 revenues of $1.032 billion, and a 22% increase over third quarter 2005 revenues of $1.578 billion. Growth over the third quarter was driven by expected seasonal strength in both traffic and monetization. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC.
Revenues 
 
- Google-owned sites generated revenues of $1.098 billion, or 57% of total revenues. This represents a 24% increase over the third quarter revenues of $885 million.
Google Sites Revenues
 
- Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $799 million, or 42% of total revenues. This is an 18% increase over network revenues of $675 million generated in the third quarter.
Google Network Revenues
 
- - Revenues from outside of the United States contributed 38% of total revenues, compared to 39% in the third quarter of 2005 and 35% in the fourth quarter of 2004. International revenues reflected the unfavorable impact caused by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and stronger seasonal trends in the U.S. relative to the international business. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the third quarter through the fourth quarter, our revenues would have been $12 million, or 0.6%, higher. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from 2004 through 2005, our revenues would have been $40 million, or 2.1%, higher.
International Revenues
 
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $629 million in the fourth quarter. This compares to TAC of $530 million in the third quarter. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues decreased to 33.2% in the fourth quarter from 34.0% in the third quarter, reflecting primarily the continued shift in our revenue mix from Google network revenue to Google-owned site revenue.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
 
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $570 million, or 29.7% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $529 million, or 33.5% of revenues, in the third
Operating Income -
quarter. GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter includes a contribution of $90 million to the Google Foundation. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $718 million, or 37.4% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $596 million, or 37.8% of revenues, in the third quarter. The favorable shift in the mix of revenues to a higher proportion of revenues from Google-owned sites was offset by significant investments in all areas of the business.
 
 In the fourth quarter, the charge related to stock-based compensation was $58 million as compared to $46 million in the third quarter. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily related to Google stock units issued in 2005.
Stock-Based Compensation
 
Stock-based compensation in 2006 will be significantly greater than it was in 2005 as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be approximately 1% to 1.5% per year.
 
 GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $372 million as compared to $381 million in the third quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $469 million, compared to $437 million in the third quarter. GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.22 on 304 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $1.32 for the third quarter, on 290 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.54, compared to $1.51 in the third quarter.
Net Income
 
 Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter increased to 41.8% this quarter, and to 31.6% for the year, above our previously announced expectation of approximately 30% for the year. Because the proportion of total expenses allocated to our international operations was greater than we anticipated, more of our profits were taxed at a higher domestic tax rate; this resulted in a greater effective tax rate compared to our expectations. We expect our effective tax rate for 2006 to be approximately 30%.
Income Taxes
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter totaled $658 million as compared to $647 million for the third quarter. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the fourth quarter we generated $413 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $245 million as compared to $293 million in the third quarter, and primarily reflect purchases of production servers and networking equipment and acquisitions of additional office space.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
 
We will continue to invest significantly in capital expenditures in 2006. We expect the majority of the investment to be focused on IT infrastructure including servers, networking equipment, and data centers, as well as real estate and campus facilities.
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is another non-GAAP measure of liquidity and is defined as income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, SBC, IPR&D, and the contribution to the Google Foundation. Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $814 million in the fourth quarter from $672 million in the third quarter, or 43% of revenues for both periods.
Adjusted EBITDA
 
Reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, are included at the end of this release.

 For the year ended December 31, 2005, Google reported total revenues of $6.139 billion, an increase of 92.5% over revenues of $3.189 billion in 2004. Revenue growth was attributable to both Google sites and Google network sites.
Revenue
 
 Revenue from Google sites increased 112.5% in 2005 to $3.377 billion as traffic to Google sites continued to grow and monetization improved.
Google Sites Revenues
 
 Revenue from the Google network increased 72.9% in 2005 to $2.688 billion due primarily to increased contribution from existing partners as well as the addition of many new partners to the AdSense for Search and AdSense for Content programs.

Forward looking statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to our plans to invest in our business, our expected stock-based compensation, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, our anticipated effective tax rate for 2006, and planned capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, risks related to our international operations, our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, the mix of our US revenue as compared to our non-US revenue, the inherent uncertain and complex nature of tax forecasting, the fact that we may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities, and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Factors That Could Affect Future Results" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

About non-GAAP financial measures
 
To supplement Google's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the
tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliations of non-GAAP liquidity measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" included at the end of this release.
 
Google's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Google's performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Google's historical performance and liquidity and our competitors' operating results. Google believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.
 
Google has computed its non-GAAP liquidity measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Google expects to use consistent methods for computation of other non-GAAP financial measures introduced this quarter, including non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP EPS. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.
