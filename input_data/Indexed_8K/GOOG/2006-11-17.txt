Merger Agreement
In connection with the acquisition, we issued an aggregate of 3,217,560 shares, and restricted stock units, options and a warrant exercisable for or convertible into an aggregate of 442,210 shares, of our Class A common stock. The number of shares of Class A common stock issued and issuable by Google was calculated by dividing $1.65 billion less certain amounts (approximately $15 million) funded to YouTube by Google between signing and closing by the average closing price for the 30 trading days ending on November 9, 2006. Twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the equity issued and issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be subject to escrow for one year to secure indemnification claims. A copy of the Merger Agreement is filed as exhibit 2.01 to this Form 8-K.
Michael Moritz, a member of our board of directors, is a general partner of Sequoia Capital, whose affiliates were stockholders of YouTube. The shares of YouTube stock held by these affiliates were treated in the acquisition in the same manner as shares of stock held by the other stockholders of YouTube.

The issuance of the shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Regulation D thereunder, as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering.
Item 2.01 of this Form 8-K contains a more detailed description of the issuance of shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and is incorporated into this Item 3.02 by reference.

Each party hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Action so brought and waives any bond, surety, or other security that might be required of any other party hereto with respect thereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process on it by notice as provided in Section 10.3 shall be deemed effective service of process.
10.6 .
Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration
(a) Any claim or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination thereof, shall (except as specifically set forth in this Agreement) be finally settled by binding arbitration in the County of Santa Clara, California in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial proceeding instituted to resolve a dispute.
(b) Such arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator chosen by mutual agreement of Parent and the Stockholders Agent. Alternatively, at the request of either party before the commencement of arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted by three independent arbitrators, none of whom shall have any competitive interests with the Parent or Stockholders Agent. Parent and Stockholders Agent shall each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator.
(c) In any arbitration under this Section 10.6, each party shall be limited to calling a total of three witnesses both for purposes of deposition and the arbitration hearing. Subject to the foregoing limitation on the number of witnesses, the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, including attorneys' fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification.
(d) The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or
 
order awarded by the arbitrator(s). Within 30 days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall make the payment to such other party, including any distributions out of the Escrow Fund, as applicable.
(e) The parties to the arbitration may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach of this arbitration provision and without abridgement of the powers of the arbitrator(s).
(f) The parties agree that each party shall pay its own costs and expenses (including counsel fees) of any such arbitration, and each party waives its right to seek an order compelling the other party to pay its portion of its costs and expenses (including counsel fees) for any arbitration.
10.7 . As of the Effective Time, each Stockholder Party, for itself and on behalf of its heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the ""), does hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waive, release and forever discharge the Company and each current (as of the Effective Time) and former director and officer of the Company from any and all Claims that such Relevant Persons may have against the Company, a director or officer to the extent such Claims arise out of or relate to such Relevant Person's ownership of Company Stock or other Equity Interests in the Company or their status as a securityholder of the Company except for any breach of the Agreement or any Transaction Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, this is not intended to, and shall not constitute, a release of any Claims arising out of a Relevant Person's status as a director or officer of the Company). With respect to such Claims, each Seller Party hereby expressly waives any and all rights conferred upon him or her by any statute or rule of law which provides that a release does not extend to claims which the claimant does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the released party, including, without limitation, the following provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."
