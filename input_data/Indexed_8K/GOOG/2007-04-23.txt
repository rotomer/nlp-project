Additional Agreements of the Company
7. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of you and each person, if any, who controls each of you within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each of your affiliates within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Hedging Prospectus (each as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the relevant Bidder furnished to the Company in writing by such Bidder expressly for use therein.
Indemnification and Contribution
(b) Each of you agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each of you, but only with reference to
 
information relating to the relevant Bidder furnished to the Company in writing by such Bidder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Hedging Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified party, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein in connection with any short sale of Shares effected using the Hedging Prospectus, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the relevant Bidder on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the relevant Bidder on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by such Bidder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The obligations of the Bidders to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective aggregate notional amounts of Transferable Stock Options purchased by each Bidder under the Transferable Stock Option Program, and not joint.
(e) The Company and each of you agrees that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Bidder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which such Bidder sold Shares to the public using the Hedging Prospectus exceeds the amount of any damages that such Bidder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or the Program Agreements will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement or any Program Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the relevant Bidder, any person controlling such Bidder or any of its affiliates or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Warrants purchased under the Transferable Stock Option Program.
 
8. . The Company may terminate this Agreement in whole or as to any Bidder and any Bidder may terminate this Agreement as to such Bidder, in each case, at any time by giving written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto not less than three Exchange Business Days prior to the effective date of such notice. Any such termination shall be without prejudice to any rights, obligations or liabilities of the parties hereto accrued or incurred prior to such termination. If this Agreement is terminated, the last paragraph of Section 5 and Sections 3(d), 4(e), 4(j), 7, 10, and 12 shall survive as to the Company and each terminated Bidder.

The Issuer and the Warrantholders acknowledge that registration under the Securities Act is not required for the delivery of Shares or other securities included in the Warrant Termination Delivery Property upon the satisfaction of a Payment Obligation if such Shares or other securities are used solely to close out open borrowings created in the course of the Warrantholders' Hedging Activities related to their exposure under their Warrants. If, in the reasonable judgment of the relevant Warrantholder, the Shares or other securities to be delivered upon the satisfaction of a Payment Obligation cannot be so used, such Warrantholder shall so notify the Issuer not later than the second Exchange Business Day immediately succeeding the relevant Cancellation Amount Notice Date, and the delivery of such Shares or other securities shall be made pursuant to Section 5.08.
(c) Any securities included in the Warrant Termination Delivery Property and delivered to satisfy a Payment Obligation shall be validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable and shall be free of any pre-emptive or similar rights.

If the Issuer elects the Warrant Termination Alternative in accordance with Section 5.07 hereof and the Warrantholder provides notice of its determination in accordance with this Section 5.08 that the Warrant Termination Delivery Property to be delivered in such Warrant Termination Alternative would include Restricted Shares, then the Issuer shall, not later than the third Exchange Business Day immediately succeeding the Cancellation Amount Notice Date, notify such Warrantholder whether a Private Placement Settlement or Registration Settlement would apply to the delivery of such Warrant Termination Delivery Property. As used in this Section 5.08, the term "Restricted Shares" shall not include any Shares or other securities included in the Warrant Termination Delivery Property if, in the reasonable judgment of the relevant Warrantholder, it may use such Shares or other securities, without having to comply with any Restrictions, to close out open borrowings created in the course of such Warrantholder's Hedging Activities related to its exposure under the relevant Warrants.
Restricted Shares
(a) If the Issuer elects to satisfy its Payment Obligation pursuant to this Section 5.08(a) (a ""), then delivery of Restricted Shares by the Issuer shall be effected in customary private placement procedures with respect to such Restricted Shares reasonably acceptable to such Warrantholder; provided that the Issuer may not elect a Private Placement Settlement if, on the date of its election, it has taken, or caused to be taken, any action that would make unavailable either the exemption pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for the sale by the Issuer to the Warrantholder of the Restricted Shares or the exemption pursuant to Section 4(1) or Section 4(3) of the Securities Act for resales of the Restricted Shares by the Warrantholder. The Private Placement Settlement of such Restricted Shares shall include customary representations, covenants, blue sky and other governmental filings and/or registrations, indemnities to such Warrantholder due diligence rights (for such Warrantholder or any designated buyer of the Restricted Shares by such Warrantholder), opinions and certificates, and such other documentation as is customary for private placement agreements, all reasonably acceptable to such Warrantholder. In the case of a Private Placement Settlement, such Warrantholder shall determine the appropriate discount to the Warrant Termination Unit Price applicable to such Restricted Shares in a commercially

reasonable manner and appropriately adjust the amount of such Restricted Shares to be delivered to such Warrantholder or hereunder and shall deliver notice to the Issuer of its determination of such discount and amount as soon as practicable but in no event later than the sixth Exchange Business Day following the Cancellation Amount Notice Date.

If such Warrantholder is satisfied with such procedures and documentation, it shall sell the Restricted Shares pursuant to such registration statement during a period (the "") commencing on the Registration Deadline and ending on the earliest of (x) the Exchange Business Day on which the Warrantholder completes the sale of all Restricted Shares or, in the case of settlement of Warrant Termination Delivery Units, a sufficient number of Restricted Shares so that the realized net proceeds of such sales exceed the Payment Obligation, (y) the date upon which all Restricted Shares have been sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 (or similar provisions then in force) or Rule 145(d)(1) or (2) (or any similar provision then in force) under the Securities Act and (iii) the date upon which all Restricted Shares may be sold or transferred by a non-affiliate pursuant to Rule 144(k) (or any similar provision then in force) or Rule 145(d)(3) (or any similar provision then in force) under the Securities Act. If the Payment Obligation exceeds the realized net proceeds from such resale, the Warrantholder shall so notify the Issuer and the Issuer shall transfer to the Warrantholder by the open of the regular trading session on the Exchange on the Exchange Business Day immediately following the date the Warrantholder delivers such notice, the amount of such excess (the "") in cash or in a number of Restricted Shares ("") in an amount that, based on the Relevant Price on the last Valid Day on which the Warrantholder sold Restricted Shares that were already

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuer agrees that any Restricted Shares delivered to the Warrantholder as purchaser of such Restricted Shares may be transferred by and among such Warrantholder's Affiliates and the Issuer shall effect such transfer without any further action by the Warrantholder, and that after the date upon which such Restricted Shares may be sold or transferred by the Warrantholder pursuant to Rule 144(k) (or any similar provision then in force), the Issuer shall promptly remove, or cause the transfer agent for such Restricted Shares to remove, any legends referring to any such restrictions or requirements from such Restricted Shares upon delivery by the Warrantholder or its Affiliates, as the case may be, to the Issuer or such transfer agent of seller's and broker's representation letters customarily delivered by the Warrantholder in connection with resales of restricted securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, without any further requirement for the delivery of any certificate, consent, agreement, opinion of counsel, notice or any other document, any transfer tax stamps or payment of any other amount or any other action by the Warrantholder or its Affiliates, as the case may be.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.08, if the Issuer shall fail to fulfill the requirements described in Section 5.08(a) or Section 5.08(b) by the Private Placement Deadline or the Registration Deadline, as applicable, at the Issuer's election, the Issuer and the applicable Warrantholder will work together in good faith to calculate any unwind or other costs caused by such failure and to extend such dates to the extent reasonably necessary to allow the Issuer to fulfill those requirements or otherwise unwind or settle the applicable Warrants. If the Issuer does not so elect, then failure to effect such Private Placement Settlement or such Registration Settlement shall constitute an event for which the relevant Warrantholder shall determine a Cancellation Amount. Any such Cancellation Amount shall be payable in cash by the Issuer to the relevant Warrantholder or Bidder, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 6.06 and Section 6.07.

If the Lending Party does not lend Shares in the amount of the Hedging Shares or a satisfactory Lending Party is not identified within this period, the Warrantholder may give notice to the Issuer that it elects to terminate the relevant Warrants, specifying the date of such termination, which may be the same day that the notice of termination is effective, in which event such

Section 9.19The Issuer and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name any Warrants are listed in the Electronic Grid as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes whatsoever and neither the Issuer nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary or be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in any Warrants on the part of any other person.

Such Warrantholder shall be discharged of its obligations to the Issuer to the extent of any such performance.
. Designation.
Section 9.21Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, a Warrant shall not be exercised, and a Warrantholder shall not be required to accept a delivery of Shares pursuant to Section 5.07 hereof, to the extent (but only to the extent) that, after the delivery of the Net Shares, the Full Physical Shares or any Shares included in the Warrant Termination Delivery Property, as the case may be, the relevant Warrantholder (or its ultimate parent entity) would directly or indirectly beneficially own (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) in excess of 8.0% of the outstanding Shares. Any purported delivery hereunder shall be void and have no effect to the extent (but only to the extent) that, after such delivery, such Warrantholder (or its ultimate parent entity) would directly or indirectly so beneficially own in excess of 8.0% of the outstanding Shares. If any delivery owed to such Warrantholder hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this provision, the Issuer's obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and the Issuer shall make such delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one Exchange Business Day after, such Warrantholder gives notice to the Issuer that, after such delivery, such Warrantholder (and its ultimate parent entity) would not directly or indirectly so beneficially own in excess of 8.0% of the outstanding Shares.

Section 9.23Notwithstanding any communication that each party (and/or its Affiliates) may have had with any other party, each Warrantholder and the Issuer agree and acknowledge that (A) any Hedge Position established by a Warrantholder or any of its Affiliates is a proprietary trading position and activity of such Warrantholder or such Affiliate and (B) each Warrantholder or such Affiliate is not holding the Hedge Positions or engaging in the Hedging Activities on behalf or for the account of or as agent or fiduciary for the Issuer, and the Issuer will not have any direct economic or other interest in, or beneficial ownership of, the Hedge Positions or Hedging Activities.

Any such communication should not be the basis on which the recipient has entered into this Warrant Agreement or purchased Warrants, and should be independently confirmed by the recipient and its advisors prior to entering into this Warrant Agreement or purchasing Warrants; and
 
(c) each Warrantholder and/or its Affiliates may have banking or other commercial relationships with the Issuer and may engage in proprietary trading in the Shares or options, futures, derivatives or other instruments relating to the Shares (including such trading as such Warrantholder and/or its Affiliates deem appropriate in their sole discretion to hedge their market risk on any Warrants and other transactions relating to the Shares), and that trading may affect the price of the Shares and consequently the amounts payable or deliverable under a Warrant.
