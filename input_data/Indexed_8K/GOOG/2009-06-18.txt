In June 2009, Google Inc. invested approximately $2.6 million in the Series B preferred stock financing of 23andMe, Inc., a privately-held personal genetics company dedicated to helping individuals understand their own genetic information through DNA analysis technologies and web-based interactive tools. Google previously invested approximately $3.9 million in the Series A preferred stock financing of 23andMe in May 2007. In November 2007, Google purchased additional shares of Series A preferred stock of 23andMe held by an investor in 23andMe's Series A preferred stock financing for approximately $500,000. Google made this investment in the Series B preferred stock financing of 23andMe pursuant to Google's existing right to purchase its pro rata share of new securities issued by 23andMe. Google continues to hold a minority interest in 23andMe as a result of the Series B investment. 23andMe's Series B financing involved a number of additional investors including New Enterprise Associates. Anne Wojcicki, who is a co-founder of 23andMe and who is also a stockholder and member of the board of directors, is married to Sergey Brin, Google's President, Technology and one of its founders. Sergey also holds approximately 38% of Google's Class B common stock. Prior to Google's investment in 23andMe's Series B preferred stock financing, Sergey also invested approximately $10 million in 23andMe's convertible debt financing, which was converted into Series B preferred stock as part of this financing transaction. In June 2009, Google also entered into a lease agreement with 23andMe. Google's Audit Committee reviewed and approved the investment and lease transactions as part of Google's procedures for entering into transactions with related parties. The valuation of the Series B investment was determined by negotiations between New Enterprise Associates and 23andMe in which Google played no role. The terms and conditions of the lease with 23andMe were reviewed by an independent real estate appraiser. As part of its decision-making process, the Audit Committee was advised by independent counsel.
