indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.

No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Section 8(a)
Section 8(b)
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Final Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
Section 8
 
state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above in this paragraph (d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this , no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. If another party or other parties become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus that effects any such changes.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special United States counsel to Google Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-), of $[amount] aggregate principal amount of [interest rate]% Notes due [year] (the "Securities") to be issued under an indenture dated as of [date] (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). Such registration statement, as amended as of its most recent effective date ([date]), insofar as it relates to the Securities (as determined for purposes of Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated [date] included in the Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the preliminary prospectus supplement dated [date], as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement;" and the related prospectus supplement dated [date], as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Final Prospectus Supplement." The Base Prospectus and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Pricing Prospectus," and the Base Prospectus and the Final Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Final Prospectus." This opinion letter is furnished pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement dated [date], in the form in which it was incorporated into the Terms Agreement dated [date] (together, the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters").
            
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have reviewed the following documents:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other documents, and we have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement).
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that:
1. The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2. The Company has corporate power to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein), and the Company has corporate power to issue the Securities, to enter into the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and to perform its obligations thereunder.
3. The execution and delivery of the Indenture have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the Company, and qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of the Company.
4. The execution and delivery of the Securities have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Securities have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
5. The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
6. The issuance and sale of the Securities to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations in the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities will not, (a) require any filing, consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any governmental authority of the United States or the State of New York that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance, except such as have been obtained or effected under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act (but we express no opinion relating to any state securities or Blue Sky laws and we have assumed for purposes of the foregoing opinion that the Company is
 
not required to make any filing pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act because a free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) was prepared or used by the Underwriters), (b) result in a breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any of the agreements of the Company that were filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and filed pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K, or a violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or contravene (based solely on inquiry of [name], [title] of the Company) any judgment, decree or order applicable to the Company of any court or other governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Company or (c) result in a violation of any United States federal or New York State law or published rule or regulation that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance (but we express no opinion relating to the United States federal securities laws or any state securities or Blue Sky laws).
7. The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, will not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
8. The statements under the headings "Description of [Securities]" and "Description of Debt Securities" in the Pricing Prospectus considered together with the document attached as Annex I hereto and the Final Prospectus, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Securities and the Indenture, provide a fair summary of such provisions.
9. The statements under the heading ["Certain United States Federal Tax Considerations"] in the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain federal tax laws of the United States, constitute a fair summary of the principal U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Securities.
Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the valid existence and good standing of the Company, they are based solely on a certificate of good standing received from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and on a telephonic confirmation from such Secretary of State. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, (a) we have assumed that the Company and each other party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (except that no such assumption is made as to the Company regarding matters of the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such agreement or obligation) and (b) such opinions are subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
We are furnishing this opinion letter to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities. This opinion letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose, except that numbered paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this opinion letter may be relied upon by the Trustee, in its capacity as such. We assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

Such registration statement, as amended as of its most recent effective date ([date]), insofar as it relates to the Securities (as determined for purposes of Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein and Exhibit 25, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated [date] included in the Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the preliminary prospectus supplement dated [date], as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement;" and the related prospectus supplement dated [date], as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Final Prospectus Supplement." The Base Prospectus and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Pricing Prospectus," and the Base Prospectus and the Final Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Final Prospectus." This letter is furnished pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement dated [date], in the form in which it was incorporated into the Terms Agreement dated [date] (together, the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters").
            
Because the primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or statistical information, and because many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference in each of them and the document attached as Annex I hereto are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference in each of them or the document attached as Annex I hereto (except to the extent expressly set forth in numbered paragraphs 8 and 9 of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith), and we make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements (except as aforesaid). We also are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for ascertaining whether or when any of the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference in each of them or the document attached as Annex I hereto was conveyed to any person for purposes of Rule 159 under the Securities Act.
However, in the course of our acting as special United States counsel to the Company in connection with its preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and the document attached as Annex I hereto, we participated in conferences and telephone conversations
 
with representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, your representatives and representatives of your counsel, during which conferences and conversations the contents of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, portions of certain of the documents incorporated by reference in each of them and the document attached as Annex I hereto, and related matters were discussed, and we reviewed certain corporate records and documents furnished to us by the Company.
Based on our participation in such conferences and conversations and our review of such records and documents as described above, our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder, we advise you that:
(a) The Registration Statement (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting data included therein, as to which we express no view), at the time it became effective, and the Final Prospectus (except as aforesaid), as of the date thereof, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, we do not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus that are not filed or described as required.
(b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the respective dates of their filing with the Commission, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
(c) No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which we express no view), at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
(d) No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Pricing Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, considered together with the document attached as Annex I hereto (except in each case the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which we express no view), at the time of execution of the Underwriting Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(e) No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Final Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except in each case the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the date thereof or hereof, contained or contains
 
an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We confirm to you that (a) based solely upon email confirmation of receipt of the filing and Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act, the Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act, and (b) based solely upon a telephonic confirmation from a representative of the Commission, no stop order with respect thereto has been issued by the Commission, and to the best of our knowledge, no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
In addition, we confirm to you that, based solely on inquiry of [name], [title] of the Company, we know of no legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company is a party that are currently pending before any adjudicative tribunal or that have been threatened by a written communication manifesting an intention to initiate such proceedings received by the management of the Company or by us that are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement or the documents incorporated by reference therein that are not disclosed in the Pricing Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein and the document attached as Annex I hereto and the Final Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein.
We are furnishing this letter to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities. This letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose. We assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the views expressed herein.

If a payment date is not a Business Day as defined in the Indenture at a Place of Payment, payment may be made at that place on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

The Indenture contains provisions that provide that the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of amending any provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of such series to be affected with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series affected by such amendment voting separately; that, without the consent of each Holder of the Securities of each series affected thereby, an amendment may not: (i) extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, such Holder's Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the interest thereon or any premium payable upon redemption thereof, or change the Currency in which the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on such Security is denominated or payable, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date), or materially adversely affect the economic terms of the Holder's right to convert or exchange any Security as may be provided in the Indenture; (ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or certain Defaults hereunder and their consequences provided for in the Indenture; (iii) modify any of the provisions of the Indenture governing amendments or waivers with the consent of Holders except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; or (iv) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee.

It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of a series of Securities at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except a Default in the payment of interest or any premium on or the principal of the Securities of such series or a Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series. Upon any such waiver, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights under the Indenture, respectively; that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
provided
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in the manner, at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
The Notes will be issued in fully registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and are transferable and exchangeable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, which shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture.
The Notes are redeemable prior to maturity at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of
the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate plus 5 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of the Notes.
For the purposes of determining the redemption price, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Notes to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the related Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date. As used in the immediately preceding sentence and in the definition of "Treasury Rate" above, the term "business day" means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York City are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and their respective successors, unless any of them ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), in which case the Company shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, which shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and, subject to the provisions hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any incorporator as such, or against any past, present or future stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
Terms used herein that are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.
The laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof) shall govern this Note.

This Note is one of a series designated as the 3.625% Notes due 2021 of the Company, limited in aggregate principal amount to $1,000,000,000; , , that the Company, without notice to or consent of the Holders, may issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions (except for issue date, public offering price and, if applicable, the date from which interest accrues and the first Interest Payment Date). Any additional Securities shall be issued under a separate CUSIP number unless: (i) the additional Securities and the outstanding notes of the original series are treated as part of the same "issue" of debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) the additional Securities are issued pursuant to a "qualified reopening" of the outstanding notes of the original series for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or (iii) the additional Securities are, and the outstanding notes of the original series were, issued without original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal, premium, if any, and, to the extent lawful, on overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by this Note. If a payment date is not a Business Day as defined in the Indenture at a Place of Payment, payment may be made at that place on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.
In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the 3.625% Notes due 2021 shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof and the interest accrued hereon, if any, may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions that provide that the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of amending any provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of such series to be affected with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series affected by such amendment voting separately; that, without the consent of each Holder of the Securities of each series affected thereby, an amendment may not: (i) extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, such Holder's Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the interest thereon or any premium payable upon redemption thereof, or change the Currency in which the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on such Security is denominated or payable, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date), or materially adversely affect the economic terms of the Holder's right to convert or exchange any Security as may be provided in the Indenture; (ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or certain Defaults hereunder and their consequences provided for in the Indenture; (iii) modify any of the provisions of the Indenture governing amendments or waivers with the consent of Holders except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; or (iv) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee.
provided
It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of a series of Securities at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except a Default in the payment of interest or any premium on or the principal of the Securities of such series or a Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series. Upon any such waiver, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights under the Indenture, respectively; that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
provided
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in the manner, at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
The Notes will be issued in fully registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and are transferable and exchangeable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, which shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture.
The Notes are redeemable prior to maturity at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of
the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate plus 10 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of the Notes.
For the purposes of determining the redemption price, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Notes to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the related Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date. As used in the immediately preceding sentence and in the definition of "Treasury Rate" above, the term "business day" means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York City are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and their respective successors, unless any of them ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), in which case the Company shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, which shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and, subject to the provisions hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any incorporator as such, or against any past, present or future stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
Terms used herein that are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.
The laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof) shall govern this Note.
