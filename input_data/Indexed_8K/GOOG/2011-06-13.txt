Amendment No. 1
Original Filing
 
At Google's 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 2, 2011, Google's stockholders voted on, among other matters, a proposal on the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to named executive officers. As previously reported by Google, the frequency of once every three years received the highest number of votes cast, as well as a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Based on these results, and consistent with Google's recommendation, Google's Board of Directors has determined that Google will conduct future stockholder advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to its named executive officers once every three years. The next required stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to named executive officers will be conducted at Google's 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
