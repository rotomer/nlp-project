Google's 2012 Stock Plan and 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan for Employees and Consultants of Motorola Mobility
On June 21, 2012, at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Google Inc. ("Google"), Google's stockholders approved the Google Inc. 2012 Stock Plan and the Google Inc. 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan for Employees and Consultants of Motorola Mobility. A description of these plans is set forth in Google's definitive proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 9, 2012 and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of these plans, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.01 and 10.02 to this Form 8-K.
 
The following proposals were submitted to Google's stockholders at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 21, 2012:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For more information about the foregoing proposals, see Google's definitive proxy statement dated May 9, 2012.
Holders of the shares of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of the shares of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of the shares of Class A common stock and holders of the shares of Class B common stock voted together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of stockholders at this annual meeting. In addition, holders of the shares of Class B common stock voted as a separate class on the proposal to approve the adoption of Google's Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (comprising three proposals).
The number of votes cast for and against and the number of abstentions and broker non-votes with respect to each matter voted upon are set forth below:
 
The 10 nominees were elected to Google's Board of Directors and will serve as directors until Google's next annual meeting or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.
 
The results of the voting were 861,377,964 votes for, 1,507,794 votes against, and 651,575 abstentions. There were no broker non-votes on this matter. The appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Google's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012 was ratified.
 
 
 
 
The results of the voting on Proposal Numbers 3A, 3B, and 3C, with (1) holders of the shares of Class A common stock and holders of the shares of Class B common stock voting together as a single class, and (2) holders of the shares of Class B common stock voting as a separate class, are set forth below:
 
Each of the proposals comprising Proposal Number 3 had been cross-conditioned upon the approval by Google's stockholders of all of the proposals comprising Proposal Number 3. The approval of each of the proposals comprising Proposal Number 3 constituted the requisite approval of the adoption of the Google's Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as required by Delaware law. The adoption of Google's Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was approved.
 
The results of the voting were 673,835,311 votes for, 160,535,207 votes against, 692,672 abstentions, and 28,474,143 broker non-votes. Google's 2012 Stock Plan was approved.
 
The results of the voting were 676,204,541 votes for, 158,174,848 votes against, 683,876 abstentions, and 28,474,068 broker non-votes. Google's 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan for Employees and Consultants of Motorola Mobility was approved.
 
The results of the voting were 6,995,169 votes for, 807,879,913 votes against, 20,187,757 abstentions, and 28,474,494 broker non-votes. The stockholder proposal regarding an advisory vote on political contributions was defeated.
 
The results of the voting were 2,980,698 votes for, 830,806,516 votes against, 1,275,669 abstentions, and 28,474,459 broker non-votes. The stockholder proposal regarding mandatory arbitration of certain shareholder claims was defeated.
 
The results of the voting were 147,240,478 votes for, 686,884,401 votes against, 938,344 abstentions, and 28,474,110 broker non-votes. The stockholder proposal regarding equal shareholder voting was defeated.
On June 22, 2012, Google filed the Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. As previously reported, Google's recapitalization is the subject of pending litigation. Once this litigation has been resolved, Google expects its Board of Directors to consider the declaration of a dividend of one share of Class C capital stock for each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of a record date to be determined at that time by the Board of Directors. Google cannot predict when the pending litigation will be resolved, but does not expect it to occur before the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
On June 26, 2012, Google issued a press release announcing that it had posted a short presentation (the "Presentation") focusing on the general framework of Google's financial disclosure to incorporate the results of former Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. Copies of the press release and the Presentation are filed as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, to this Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 10.01
1.
Purpose of the Plan
This Plan is intended to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing the employees and consultants of the Company and members of the Board of Directors with incentives and rewards to encourage them to continue in the service of the Company and with a proprietary interest in pursuing the long-term growth, profitability and financial success of the Company.
2.
Definitions
As used in the Plan or in any instrument governing the terms of any Incentive Award, the following definitions apply to the terms indicated below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.
Stock Subject to the Plan and Limitations on Cash Incentive Awards
(a)
Stock Subject to the Plan
The maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards granted under the Plan shall not exceed 30,000,000 shares of Capital Stock in the aggregate. The maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards granted under the Plan that are intended to be ISOs shall not exceed 30,000,000 shares of Capital Stock in the aggregate. The shares referred to in the preceding sentences of this paragraph shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10 and the following provisions of this Section 3. Shares of Capital Stock issued under the Plan may be either authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares, or both, at the sole discretion of the Committee.
 
For purposes of the preceding paragraph, shares of Capital Stock covered by Incentive Awards shall only be counted as used to the extent they are actually issued and delivered to a Participant (or such Participant's permitted transferees as described in the Plan) pursuant to the Plan. For purposes of clarification, in accordance with the preceding sentence if an Incentive Award is settled for cash or if shares of Capital Stock are withheld to pay the exercise price of an Option or to satisfy any tax withholding requirement in connection with an Incentive Award, only the shares issued (if any), net of the shares withheld, will be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the number of shares of Capital Stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. In addition, shares of Capital Stock related to Incentive Awards that expire, are forfeited or cancelled or terminate for any reason without the issuance of shares shall not be treated as issued pursuant to the Plan. In addition, if shares of Capital Stock owned by a Participant (or such Participant's permitted transferees as described in the Plan) are tendered (either actually or through attestation) to the Company in payment of any obligation in connection with an Incentive Award, the number of shares tendered shall be added to the number of shares of Capital Stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. Shares of Capital Stock covered by Incentive Awards granted pursuant to the Plan in connection with the conversion, replacement, or adjustment of outstanding equity-based awards to reflect a merger or acquisition (within the meaning of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c) and Interpretive Material 5635-1) shall not count as used under the Plan for purposes of this Section 3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, shares of Capital Stock attributable to Incentive Awards transferred under any Incentive Award Transfer Program shall not again be available for delivery under the Plan.
(b)
Individual Award Limits
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10, the maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation that are granted to any Covered Employee in any calendar year shall not exceed 1,000,000 shares. The amount payable to any Covered Employee with respect to any calendar year for all Cash Incentive Awards shall not exceed $100 million. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the phrase "amount payable with respect to any calendar year" means the amount of cash, or value of other property, required to be paid based on the achievement of applicable Performance Measures during a Performance Period that ends in a calendar year, disregarding any deferral pursuant to the terms of a Deferred Compensation Plan unless the terms of the deferral are intended to comply with the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
4.
Administration of the Plan
The Plan shall be administered by a Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of two or more persons, each of whom qualifies as a "non-employee director" (within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act), an "outside director" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.162-27(e)(3) and as "independent" within the meaning of any applicable stock exchange listing rules or similar regulatory authority. The Committee shall, consistent with the terms of the Plan, from time to time designate those employees and consultants of the Company and members of the Board of Directors who shall be granted Incentive Awards under the Plan and the amount, type and other terms and conditions of such Incentive Awards. All of the powers and responsibilities of the Committee under the Plan may be delegated by the Committee to any subcommittee thereof. In addition, the Committee may from time to time authorize a subcommittee consisting of one or more members of the Board of Directors (including members who are employees of the Company) or employees of the Company to grant Incentive Awards, subject to such restrictions and limitation as the Committee may specify and to the requirements of Delaware General Corporation Law Section 157.
The Committee shall have full discretionary authority to administer the Plan, including discretionary authority to interpret and construe any and all provisions of the Plan and the terms of any Incentive Award (and any agreement evidencing the grant of any Incentive Award) granted thereunder and to adopt and amend from time to time such rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as the Committee may deem necessary or appropriate. The Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations related to sub-plans established for the purpose of satisfying applicable foreign laws and/or qualifying for preferred tax treatment under applicable foreign tax laws. For purposes of clarity, the Committee may exercise all discretion granted to it under the Plan in a non-uniform manner among Participants.
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the Committee shall determine whether an authorized leave of absence, or absence in military or government service, shall constitute termination of employment, provided that a Participant who is an employee will not be deemed to cease employment in the case of any leave of absence approved by the Company. Unless the Committee provides otherwise in the agreement evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award, vesting of Incentive Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence and will resume on the date the Participant returns to work on a regular schedule as determined by the Company, it being understood that no vesting credit will be awarded for the time vesting has been suspended during such leave of absence. For purposes of ISOs, no such leave may exceed ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then three months following the 91
st
day of such leave any ISO held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an ISO and will be treated for tax purposes as a non-qualified Option. The provisions of this paragraph shall be administered and interpreted in a manner that does not give rise to any tax under Section 409A of the Code.
The employment of a Participant with the Company shall be deemed to have terminated for all purposes of the Plan if such Participant is employed by or provides services to a Person that is a Subsidiary of the Company and such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The Committee may, without limitation and in its discretion, in connection with any such determination, provide for the accelerated vesting of any Incentive Award upon or after such cessation, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall specify. The employment of a Participant with the Company shall not be deemed to have terminated for any purpose of the Plan if such Participant is employed by a Person that is part of the Company, and such Participant's employment is subsequently transferred to any other Person that is part of the Company, unless and to the extent the Committee specifies otherwise in writing in the instrument evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award or otherwise. A Participant who ceases to be an employee of the Company but continues, or simultaneously commences, services as a consultant or director of the Company shall not be deemed to have had a termination of employment for purposes of the Plan, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Decisions of the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties. All discretion granted to the Committee pursuant to this paragraph must be exercised in a manner that would not cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
On or after the date of grant of an Incentive Award under the Plan, the Committee may (i) accelerate the date on which any such Incentive Award becomes vested, exercisable or transferable, as the case may be, (ii) extend the term of any such Incentive Award, including, without limitation, extending the period following a termination of a Participant's employment during which any such Incentive Award may remain outstanding, (iii) waive any conditions to the vesting, exercisability or transferability, as the case may be, of any such Incentive Award, or (iv) provide for the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any such Incentive Award; , that the Committee shall not have any such authority to the extent that the grant of such authority would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
provided
The Board of Directors or the Committee may, at any time, in its sole and complete discretion, implement an Incentive Award Transfer Program.
The Company shall pay any amount payable with respect to an Incentive Award in accordance with the terms of such Incentive Award, provided that the Committee may, in its discretion, defer the payment of amounts payable with respect to an Incentive Award subject to and in accordance with the terms of a Deferred Compensation Plan.
 
5.
Eligibility
The Persons who shall be eligible to be selected by the Committee from time to time to receive Incentive Awards pursuant to the Plan shall be those Persons (a) who are employees and consultants of, or who render services directly or indirectly to, the Company or (b) who are members of the Board of Directors. Each Incentive Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing in form and substance approved by the Committee.
6.
Options
The Committee may from time to time grant Options, subject to the following terms and conditions:
(a)

The exercise price per share of Capital Stock covered by any Option shall be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Capital Stock on the date on which such Option is granted.
(b)
Term and Exercise of Options
(i) Each Option shall become vested and exercisable on such date or dates, during such period and for such number of shares of Capital Stock as shall be determined by the Committee on or after the date such Option is granted and set forth in the agreement evidencing the grant of such Option; , that no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date such Option is granted; and, , , that each Option shall be subject to earlier termination, expiration or cancellation as provided in the Plan or in the agreement evidencing the grant of such Option.
provided
however
provided
further
(ii) Each Option may be exercised in whole or in part; , that no partial exercise of an Option shall be for an aggregate exercise price of less than $1,000. The partial exercise of an Option shall not cause the expiration, termination or cancellation of the remaining portion thereof.
provided
however
(iii) An Option shall be exercised by such methods and procedures as the Committee determines from time to time, including without limitation through net physical settlement or other method of cashless exercise.
(iv) Options may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of a Participant, only by the Participant; , that the Committee may permit in its discretion Options to be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of, on a general or specific basis, subject to such conditions and limitations as the Committee may determine, including through the implementation of an Incentive Award Transfer Program.
provided
however
(c)
Effect of Termination of Employment or Other Relationship
The agreement evidencing the grant of each Option shall specify the consequences with respect to such Option of the termination of the employment or other service between the Company and the Participant holding the Option.
(d)
Additional Terms for ISOs
Each Option that is intended to qualify as an ISO shall be designated as such in the agreement evidencing its grant, and each agreement evidencing the grant of an Option that does not include any such designation shall be deemed to be a non-qualified Option. ISOs may only be granted to Persons who are employees of the Company. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant of the ISOs) of the number of shares of Capital Stock with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by any Participant during any calendar year under all plans of the Company shall not exceed $100,000, or such other maximum amount as is then applicable under Section 422 of the Code. Any Option or a portion thereof that is designated as an ISO that for any reason fails to meet the requirements of an ISO shall be treated hereunder as a non-qualified Option. No ISO may be granted to a Person who, at the time of the proposed grant, owns (or is deemed to own under the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of common stock of the Company unless (i) the exercise price of such ISO is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Capital Stock at the time such ISO is granted and (ii) such ISO is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date it is granted.
 
(e) .
Repricing
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Google may reprice any Option without the approval of the stockholders of Google. For this purpose, "reprice" means (i) any of the following or any other action that has the same effect: (A) lowering the exercise price of an Option after it is granted, (B) any other action that is treated as a repricing under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""), or (C) cancelling an Option at a time when its exercise price exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Capital Stock, in exchange for another Option, restricted stock or other equity, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a merger, acquisition, spin-off or other similar corporate transaction; and (ii) any other action that is considered to be a repricing under formal or informal guidance issued by The NASDAQ Stock Market.

7.
Other Stock-Based Awards
The Committee may grant equity-based or equity-related awards not otherwise described herein in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, each such Other Stock-Based Award may (a) involve the transfer of actual shares of Capital Stock to Participants, either at the time of grant or thereafter, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of shares of Capital Stock, (b) be subject to performance-based and/or service-based conditions, (c) be in the form of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, deferred share units or share-denominated performance units, (d) be designed to comply with applicable laws of jurisdictions other than the United States and (e) be designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation; , that each Other Stock-Based Award shall be denominated in, or shall have a value determined by reference to, a number of shares of Capital Stock that is specified at the time of the grant of such award.
provided
8.
Cash Incentive Awards
The Committee may grant Cash Incentive Awards with respect to any Performance Period, subject to terms and conditions determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, provided that such terms and conditions are consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Cash Incentive Awards may be settled in cash or in other property, including shares of Capital Stock, provided that the term "Cash Incentive Award" shall exclude any Stock Incentive Award. Cash Incentive Awards shall be designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation.
9.
Performance-Based Compensation
(a)
Calculation
The amount payable with respect to an Incentive Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation shall be determined in any manner permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code.
(b)
Discretionary Reduction
Unless otherwise specified in the agreement evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee may, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate the amount payable to any Participant with respect to the Incentive Award, based on such factors as the Committee may deem relevant, but the Committee may not increase any such amount above the amount established in accordance with the relevant Performance Schedule. For purposes of clarity, the Committee may exercise the discretion provided by the foregoing sentence in a non-uniform manner among Participants.
 
(c)
Performance Measures
The performance goals upon which the payment or vesting of any Incentive Award (other than Options and stock appreciation rights) that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation depends shall relate to one or more of the following Performance Measures: market price of Capital Stock, earnings per share of Capital Stock, income, net income or profit (before or after taxes), economic profit, operating income, operating margin, profit margin, gross margins, return on equity or stockholder equity, total shareholder return, market capitalization, enterprise value, cash flow (including but not limited to operating cash flow and free cash flow), cash position, return on assets or net assets, return on capital, return on invested capital, return on sales, stockholder returns, economic value added, cash value added, earnings or net earnings (before or after interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), earnings from continuing operations, operating earnings, controllable profits, sales or revenues, sales growth, new orders, capital or investment, ratio of debt to debt plus equity, ratio of operating earnings to capital spending, new product innovation, product release schedules or ship targets, market share, cost reduction goals, inventory or supply chain management initiatives, budget comparisons, implementation or completion of specified projects or processes, customer satisfaction MBOs (management by objectives), productivity, expense, margins, operating efficiency, working capital, the formation of joint ventures, research or development collaborations, or the completion of other transactions, any other measure of financial performance that can be determined pursuant to GAAP, or any combination of any of the foregoing.
A Performance Measure (i) may relate to the performance of the Participant, Google, a Subsidiary of Google, the Company, any business group, business unit or other subdivision of the Company, or any combination of the foregoing, as the Committee deems appropriate and (ii) may be expressed as an amount, as an increase or decrease over a specified period, as a relative comparison to the performance of a group of comparator companies or a published or special index, or any other external measure of the selected performance criteria, as the Committee deems appropriate. The measurement of any Performance Measure may exclude the impact of unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary items or expenses; items relating to financing activities; charges for restructurings or productivity initiatives; other non-operating items; discontinued operations; items related to the disposal of a business or segment of a business; the cumulative effect of changes in accounting treatment; items related to a change in accounting principle; items related to changes in applicable laws or business conditions; any impact of impairment of tangible or intangible assets; any impact of the issuance or repurchase of equity securities and or other changes in the number of outstanding shares of any class of Google equity securities; any gain, loss, income or expense attributable to acquisitions or dispositions of stock or assets; items attributable to the business operations of any entity acquired by Google during a Performance Period; stock-based compensation expense; in-process research and development expense; future contributions to the Google Foundation; gain or loss from all or certain claims and/or litigation and insurance recoveries; items that are outside the scope of Google's core, on-going business activities; and any other items, each determined in accordance with GAAP and as identified in Google's audited financial statements, including the notes thereto.

Performance Schedules
Within ninety (90) days after the beginning of a Performance Period, and in any case before twenty-five percent (25%) of the Performance Period has elapsed, the Committee shall establish (a) Performance Targets for such Performance Period, (b) Target Awards for each Participant, and (c) Performance Schedules for such Performance Period.
(e)
Termination of Employment
With respect to an Incentive Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the consequences of the termination of employment of the Participant holding such Incentive Award shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and set forth in the applicable agreement evidencing the grant of the Incentive Award, it being intended that no agreement providing for a payment to a Participant upon termination of employment shall be given effect to the extent that it would cause an Incentive Award that was intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation to fail to so qualify.
 
(f)
Committee Discretion
Nothing in this Section 9 is intended to limit the Committee's discretion to adopt conditions with respect to any Incentive Award that is not intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation. In addition, the Committee may, subject to the terms of the Plan, amend previously granted Incentive Awards in a way that disqualifies them as Performance-Based Compensation.
10.
Adjustment Upon Certain Changes
Subject to any action by the stockholders of Google required by law, applicable tax rules or the rules of any exchange on which shares of common stock of Google (for the avoidance of doubt, references to common stock of Google in this Plan shall include Capital Stock) are listed for trading:
(a)
Shares Available for Grants
In the event of any change in the number or type of shares of common stock of Google outstanding by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares or similar corporate change, or any change in the type and number of shares of common stock of Google outstanding by reason of any other event or transaction, the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in the type and maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee may grant Incentive Awards, the type and maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee may grant Incentive Awards that are intended to be ISOs, and the type and maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee may grant Incentive Awards that are intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation to any Covered Employee in any calendar year.
(b)
Increase or Decrease in Issued Shares Without Consideration
In the event of any increase or decrease in the number or type of issued shares of common stock of Google resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of shares of common stock of Google or the payment of a stock dividend (but only on the shares of common stock of Google), or any other increase or decrease in the number of such shares effected without receipt or payment of consideration by the Company, the Committee shall appropriately adjust the type or number of shares subject to each outstanding Incentive Award and the exercise price per share, if any, of shares subject to each such Incentive Award.
(c)
Certain Mergers
In the event of any merger, consolidation or similar transaction as a result of which the holders of shares of Capital Stock receive consideration consisting exclusively of securities of the surviving corporation in such transaction, the Committee shall appropriately adjust each Incentive Award outstanding on the date of such merger or consolidation so that it pertains and applies to the securities which a holder of the number of shares of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive Award would have received in such merger or consolidation.
(d)
Certain Other Transactions
In the event of (i) a dissolution or liquidation of Google, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets (on a consolidated basis) or (iii) a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving Google in which the holders of shares of Capital Stock receive securities and/or other property, including cash, other than shares of the surviving corporation in such transaction, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, have the power to:
(A) cancel, effective immediately prior to the occurrence of such event, each Incentive Award (whether or not then exercisable or vested), and, in full consideration of such cancellation, pay to the Participant to whom such Incentive Award was granted an amount in cash, for each share of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive Award, equal to the value, as determined by the Committee, of such share of Capital Stock, provided that with respect to the shares of Capital Stock subject to any outstanding Option such value shall be equal to the excess of (1) the value, as determined by the Committee, of the property (including cash) received by the holder of a share of Capital Stock as a result of such event over (2) the exercise price of a share of Capital Stock subject to such Option; or
 
(B) provide for the exchange of each Incentive Award (whether or not then exercisable or vested) for an Incentive Award with respect to (1) some or all of the property which a holder of the number of shares of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive Award would have received in such transaction or (2) securities of the acquirer or surviving corporation, and, incident thereto, make an equitable adjustment as determined by the Committee in the exercise price per share, if any, of stock subject to the Incentive Award, or the number of shares or amount of property subject to the Incentive Award or provide for a payment (in cash or other property) to the Participant to whom such Incentive Award was granted in partial consideration for the exchange of the Incentive Award.
(e)
Other Changes
In the event of any change in the capitalization of Google or corporate change other than those specifically referred to in paragraphs 10(b), (c) or (d), including without limitation, any extraordinary cash dividend, spin-off, split-off, sale of a Subsidiary or business unit, or similar transaction, the Committee may make such adjustments in the issuer, number and class of shares subject to Stock Incentive Awards outstanding on the date on which such change occurs, such as, for example, a rollover of Stock Incentive Awards, and in such other terms of such Incentive Award, including without limitation in any Performance Schedule, Performance Target or Target Award, as the Committee may consider appropriate, provided that if any such Incentive Award is intended to be Performance-Based Compensation such adjustment is consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
(f)
Cash Incentive Awards
In the event of any transaction or event described in this Section 10, including without limitation any corporate change referred to in paragraph (e) hereof, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such adjustments in any Performance Schedule, Performance Target or Target Award, and in such other terms of any Cash Incentive Award, as the Committee may consider appropriate in respect of such transaction or event, provided that such adjustments must be consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
(g)
No Other Rights
Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no Participant shall have any rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any dividend, any increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class or any dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation of Google or any other corporation. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no issuance by Google of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of shares or amount of other property subject to, or the terms related to, any Incentive Award.
(h)
Savings Clause
No provision of this Section 10 shall be given effect to the extent that such provision would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
11.
Rights Under the Plan
No Person shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Capital Stock covered by or relating to any Incentive Award until the date of the issuance of such shares on the books and records of Google. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 10 hereof, no adjustment of any Incentive Award shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs prior to the date of such issuance. Nothing in this Section 11 is intended, or should be construed, to limit the authority of the Committee to cause the Company to make payments based on the dividends that would be payable with respect to any share of Capital Stock if it were issued or outstanding, or from granting rights related to such dividends.
 
The Company shall not have any obligation to establish any separate fund or trust or other segregation of assets to provide for payments under the Plan. To the extent any person acquires any rights to receive payments hereunder from the Company, such rights shall be no greater than those of an unsecured creditor.
12.
No Special Employment Rights; No Right to Incentive Award
(a) Nothing contained in the Plan or any agreement evidence the grant of any Incentive Award shall confer upon any Participant any right with respect to the continuation of his employment by or service to the Company or interfere in any way with the right of the Company at any time to terminate such employment or service or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant from the rate in existence at the time of the grant of an Incentive Award.
(b) No person shall have any claim or right to receive an Incentive Award hereunder. The Committee's granting of an Incentive Award to a Participant at any time shall neither require the Committee to grant an Incentive Award to such Participant or any other Participant or other person at any time nor preclude the Committee from making subsequent grants to such Participant or any other Participant or other person.
13.
Securities Matters
(a) Google shall be under no obligation to effect the registration pursuant to the Securities Act of any shares of Capital Stock to be issued hereunder or to effect similar compliance under any state or local laws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Google shall not be obligated to cause to be issued any shares of Capital Stock pursuant to the Plan unless and until Google is advised by its counsel that the issuance of such shares is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority and the requirements of any securities exchange on which shares of Capital Stock are traded. The Committee may require, as a condition to the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to the terms hereof, that the recipient of such shares make such covenants, agreements and representations, and that any certificates representing such shares bear such legends, as the Committee deems necessary or desirable.
(b) The exercise of any Option granted hereunder shall only be effective at such time as counsel to Google shall have determined that the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to such exercise is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority and the requirements of any securities exchange on which shares of Capital Stock are traded. Google may, in its sole discretion, defer the effectiveness of an exercise of an Option hereunder or the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to any Incentive Award pending or to ensure compliance under federal, state or local securities laws. Google shall inform the Participant in writing of its decision to defer the effectiveness of the exercise of an Option or the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to any Incentive Award. During the period that the effectiveness of the exercise of an Option has been deferred, the Participant may, by written notice, withdraw such exercise and obtain the refund of any amount paid with respect thereto.
14.
Withholding Taxes
(a)
Cash Remittance
Whenever shares of Capital Stock are to be issued upon the exercise of an Option or the grant or vesting of an Incentive Award, and whenever any amount shall become payable in respect of any Incentive Award, Google shall have the right to require the Participant to remit to Google in cash an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local withholding tax requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, grant, vesting or payment prior to issuance of such shares or the effectiveness of the lapse of such restrictions or making of such payment. In addition, upon the exercise or settlement of any Incentive Award in cash, or the making of any other payment with respect to any Incentive Award (other than in shares of Capital Stock), Google shall have the right to withhold from any payment required to be made pursuant thereto an amount sufficient to satisfy the federal, state and local withholding tax requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, settlement or payment.
 
(b)
Stock Remittance
At the election of the Participant, subject to the approval of the Committee, when shares of Capital Stock are to be issued upon the exercise, grant or vesting of an Incentive Award, the Participant may tender to Google a number of shares of Capital Stock that have been owned by the Participant for at least six months (or such other period as the Committee may determine) having a Fair Market Value at the tender date determined by the Committee to be sufficient to satisfy the minimum federal, state and local withholding tax requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, grant or vesting but not greater than the minimum withholding obligations, as determined by Google in its sole discretion. Such election shall satisfy the Participant's obligations under Section 14(a) hereof, if any.
(c)
Stock Withholding
When shares of Capital Stock are to be issued upon the exercise, grant or vesting of an Incentive Award, Google shall have the authority to withhold a number of such shares having a Fair Market Value at the date of the applicable taxable event determined by the Committee to be sufficient to satisfy the minimum federal, state and local withholding tax requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, grant or vesting but not greater than the minimum withholding obligations, as determined by Google in its sole discretion.
15.
Amendment or Termination of the Plan
The Board of Directors may at any time suspend or discontinue the Plan or revise or amend it in any respect whatsoever; , , that to the extent that any applicable law, tax requirement, or rule of a stock exchange requires stockholder approval in order for any such revision or amendment to be effective, such revision or amendment shall not be effective without such approval. The preceding sentence shall not restrict the Committee's ability to exercise its discretionary authority hereunder pursuant to Section 4 hereof, which discretion may be exercised without amendment to the Plan. No provision of this Section 15 shall be given effect to the extent that such provision would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no action hereunder may, without the consent of a Participant, reduce the Participant's rights under any previously granted and outstanding Incentive Award. Nothing in the Plan shall limit the right of the Company to pay compensation of any kind outside the terms of the Plan.
provided
however
16.
No Obligation to Exercise
The grant to a Participant of an Incentive Award shall impose no obligation upon such Participant to exercise such Incentive Award.
17.
Transfers Upon Death
Upon the death of a Participant, outstanding Incentive Awards granted to such Participant may be exercised by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided that such beneficiary has been designated prior to the Participant's death. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant and shall be effective only if given in a form and manner acceptable to the Committee. In the absence of any such effective designation, such Incentive Awards may be exercised only by the executors or administrators of the Participant's estate or by any person or persons who shall have acquired such right to exercise by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. No transfer by will or the laws of descent and distribution of any Incentive Award, or the right to exercise any Incentive Award, shall be effective to bind Google unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (a) written notice thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and (b) an agreement by the transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions of the Incentive Award that are or would have been applicable to the Participant and to be bound by the acknowledgements made by the Participant in connection with the grant of the Incentive Award.
18.
Expenses and Receipts
The expenses of the Plan shall be paid by the Company. Any proceeds received by Google in connection with any Incentive Award will be used for general corporate purposes.

20.
Effective Date and Term of Plan
The Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on April 11, 2012, subject to the approval of the Plan by the stockholders of Google. No grants of Incentive Awards may be made under the Plan after April 11, 2022.
 

Exhibit 10.02
1.
Purpose of the Plan

Stock Subject to the Plan and Limitations on Cash Incentive Awards
(a)
Stock Subject to the Plan
The maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards granted under the Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000 shares of Capital Stock in the aggregate. The maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards granted under the Plan that are intended to be ISOs shall not exceed 2,000,000 shares of Capital Stock in the aggregate. The shares referred to in the preceding sentences of this paragraph shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10 and the following provisions of this Section 3. Shares of Capital Stock issued under the Plan may be either authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares, or both, at the sole discretion of the Committee.
 
For purposes of the preceding paragraph, shares of Capital Stock covered by Incentive Awards shall only be counted as used to the extent they are actually issued and delivered to a Participant (or such Participant's permitted transferees as described in the Plan) pursuant to the Plan. For purposes of clarification, in accordance with the preceding sentence if an Incentive Award is settled for cash or if shares of Capital Stock are withheld to pay the exercise price of an Option or to satisfy any tax withholding requirement in connection with an Incentive Award, only the shares issued (if any), net of the shares withheld, will be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the number of shares of Capital Stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. In addition, shares of Capital Stock related to Incentive Awards that expire, are forfeited or cancelled or terminate for any reason without the issuance of shares shall not be treated as issued pursuant to the Plan. In addition, if shares of Capital Stock owned by a Participant (or such Participant's permitted transferees as described in the Plan) are tendered (either actually or through attestation) to the Company in payment of any obligation in connection with an Incentive Award, the number of shares tendered shall be added to the number of shares of Capital Stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. Shares of Capital Stock covered by Incentive Awards granted pursuant to the Plan in connection with the conversion, replacement, or adjustment of outstanding equity-based awards to reflect a merger or acquisition (within the meaning of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c) and Interpretive Material 5635-1) shall not count as used under the Plan for purposes of this Section 3.
(b)
Individual Award Limits
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10, the maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation that are granted to any Covered Employee in any calendar year shall not exceed 1,000,000 shares. The amount payable to any Covered Employee with respect to any calendar year for all Cash Incentive Awards shall not exceed $100 million. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the phrase "amount payable with respect to any calendar year" means the amount of cash, or value of other property, required to be paid based on the achievement of applicable Performance Measures during a Performance Period that ends in a calendar year, disregarding any deferral pursuant to the terms of a Deferred Compensation Plan unless the terms of the deferral are intended to comply with the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
4.
Administration of the Plan
The Plan shall be administered by a Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of two or more persons, each of whom qualifies as a "non-employee director" (within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act), an "outside director" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.162-27(e)(3) and as "independent" within the meaning of any applicable stock exchange listing rules or similar regulatory authority. The Committee shall, consistent with the terms of the Plan, from time to time designate those employees and consultants of MMI who shall be granted Incentive Awards under the Plan and the amount, type and other terms and conditions of such Incentive Awards. All of the powers and responsibilities of the Committee under the Plan may be delegated by the Committee to any subcommittee thereof. In addition, the Committee may from time to time authorize a subcommittee consisting of one or more members of the Board of Directors (including members who are employees of the Company) or employees of the Company to grant Incentive Awards, subject to such restrictions and limitation as the Committee may specify and to the requirements of Delaware General Corporation Law Section 157.
The Committee shall have full discretionary authority to administer the Plan, including discretionary authority to interpret and construe any and all provisions of the Plan and the terms of any Incentive Award (and any agreement evidencing the grant of any Incentive Award) granted thereunder and to adopt and amend from time to time such rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as the Committee may deem necessary or appropriate. The Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations related to sub-plans established for the purpose of satisfying applicable foreign laws and/or qualifying for preferred tax treatment under applicable foreign tax laws. For purposes of clarity, the Committee may exercise all discretion granted to it under the Plan in a non-uniform manner among Participants.
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the Committee shall determine whether an authorized leave of absence, or absence in military or government service, shall constitute termination of employment, provided that a Participant who is an employee will not be deemed to cease employment in the case of any leave of absence approved by the Company. Unless the Committee provides otherwise in the agreement evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award, vesting of Incentive Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence and will resume on the date the Participant returns to work on a regular schedule as determined by the Company, it being understood that no vesting credit will be awarded for the time vesting has been suspended during such leave of absence. For purposes of ISOs, no such leave may exceed ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then three months following the 91
st
day of such leave any ISO held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an ISO and will be treated for tax purposes as a non-qualified Option. The provisions of this paragraph shall be administered and interpreted in a manner that does not give rise to any tax under Section 409A of the Code.
The employment of a Participant with the Company shall be deemed to have terminated for all purposes of the Plan if such Participant is employed by or provides services to a Person that is a Subsidiary of the Company and such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The Committee may, without limitation and in its discretion, in connection with any such determination, provide for the accelerated vesting of any Incentive Award upon or after such cessation, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall specify. The employment of a Participant with the Company shall not be deemed to have terminated for any purpose of the Plan if such Participant is employed by MMI or any other Person that is part of the Company, and such Participant's employment is subsequently transferred to any other Person that is part of the Company, unless and to the extent the Committee specifies otherwise in writing in the instrument evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award or otherwise. A Participant who ceases to be an employee of the Company but continues, or simultaneously commences, services as a consultant or director of the Company shall not be deemed to have had a termination of employment for purposes of the Plan, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Decisions of the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties. All discretion granted to the Committee pursuant to this paragraph must be exercised in a manner that would not cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
On or after the date of grant of an Incentive Award under the Plan, the Committee may (i) accelerate the date on which any such Incentive Award becomes vested, exercisable or transferable, as the case may be, (ii) extend the term of any such Incentive Award, including, without limitation, extending the period following a termination of a Participant's employment during which any such Incentive Award may remain outstanding, (iii) waive any conditions to the vesting, exercisability or transferability, as the case may be, of any such Incentive Award, or (iv) provide for the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any such Incentive Award; , that the Committee shall not have any such authority to the extent that the grant of such authority would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
provided
The Company shall pay any amount payable with respect to an Incentive Award in accordance with the terms of such Incentive Award, provided that the Committee may, in its discretion, defer the payment of amounts payable with respect to an Incentive Award subject to and in accordance with the terms of a Deferred Compensation Plan.
5.
Eligibility
The Persons who shall be eligible to be selected by the Committee from time to time to receive Incentive Awards pursuant to the Plan shall be those Persons who are employees and consultants of, or who render services directly or indirectly to, MMI. Each Incentive Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing in form and substance approved by the Committee.
 
6.
Options
The Committee may from time to time grant Options, subject to the following terms and conditions:
(a)

The exercise price per share of Capital Stock covered by any Option shall be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Capital Stock on the date on which such Option is granted.
(b)
Term and Exercise of Options
(i) Each Option shall become vested and exercisable on such date or dates, during such period and for such number of shares of Capital Stock as shall be determined by the Committee on or after the date such Option is granted and set forth in the agreement evidencing the grant of such Option; , that no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date such Option is granted; and, , , that each Option shall be subject to earlier termination, expiration or cancellation as provided in the Plan or in the agreement evidencing the grant of such Option.
provided
however
provided
further
(ii) Each Option may be exercised in whole or in part; , that no partial exercise of an Option shall be for an aggregate exercise price of less than $1,000. The partial exercise of an Option shall not cause the expiration, termination or cancellation of the remaining portion thereof.
provided
however
(iii) An Option shall be exercised by such methods and procedures as the Committee determines from time to time, including without limitation through net physical settlement or other method of cashless exercise.
(iv) Options may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of a Participant, only by the Participant; , that the Committee may permit in its discretion Options to be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of, on a general or specific basis, subject to such conditions and limitations as the Committee may determine.
provided
however
(c)
Effect of Termination of Employment or Other Relationship
The agreement evidencing the grant of each Option shall specify the consequences with respect to such Option of the termination of the employment or other service between the Company and the Participant holding the Option.
(d)
Additional Terms for ISOs
Each Option that is intended to qualify as an ISO shall be designated as such in the agreement evidencing its grant, and each agreement evidencing the grant of an Option that does not include any such designation shall be deemed to be a non-qualified Option. ISOs may only be granted to Persons who are employees of the Company. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant of the ISOs) of the number of shares of Capital Stock with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by any Participant during any calendar year under all plans of the Company shall not exceed $100,000, or such other maximum amount as is then applicable under Section 422 of the Code. Any Option or a portion thereof that is designated as an ISO that for any reason fails to meet the requirements of an ISO shall be treated hereunder as a non-qualified Option. No ISO may be granted to a Person who, at the time of the proposed grant, owns (or is deemed to own under the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of common stock of the Company unless (i) the exercise price of such ISO is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Capital Stock at the time such ISO is granted and (ii) such ISO is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date it is granted.
 
(e) .
Repricing
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Google may reprice any Option without the approval of the stockholders of Google. For this purpose, "reprice" means (i) any of the following or any other action that has the same effect: (A) lowering the exercise price of an Option after it is granted, (B) any other action that is treated as a repricing under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""), or (C) cancelling an Option at a time when its exercise price exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Capital Stock, in exchange for another Option, restricted stock or other equity, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a merger, acquisition, spin-off or other similar corporate transaction; and (ii) any other action that is considered to be a repricing under formal or informal guidance issued by The NASDAQ Stock Market.

Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, each such Other Stock-Based Award may (a) involve the transfer of actual shares of Capital Stock to Participants, either at the time of grant or thereafter, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of shares of Capital Stock, (b) be subject to performance-based and/or service-based conditions, (c) be in the form of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, deferred share units or share-denominated performance units, (d) be designed to comply with applicable laws of jurisdictions other than the United States and (e) be designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation; , that each Other Stock-Based Award shall be denominated in, or shall have a value determined by reference to, a number of shares of Capital Stock that is specified at the time of the grant of such award.
provided
8.
Cash Incentive Awards
The Committee may grant Cash Incentive Awards with respect to any Performance Period, subject to terms and conditions determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, provided that such terms and conditions are consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Cash Incentive Awards may be settled in cash or in other property, including shares of Capital Stock, provided that the term "Cash Incentive Award" shall exclude any Stock Incentive Award. Cash Incentive Awards shall be designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation.
9.
Performance-Based Compensation
(a)
Calculation
The amount payable with respect to an Incentive Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation shall be determined in any manner permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code.
(b)
Discretionary Reduction
Unless otherwise specified in the agreement evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee may, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate the amount payable to any Participant with respect to the Incentive Award, based on such factors as the Committee may deem relevant, but the Committee may not increase any such amount above the amount established in accordance with the relevant Performance Schedule. For purposes of clarity, the Committee may exercise the discretion provided by the foregoing sentence in a non-uniform manner among Participants.
 
(c)
Performance Measures
The performance goals upon which the payment or vesting of any Incentive Award (other than Options and stock appreciation rights) that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation depends shall relate to one or more of the following Performance Measures: market price of Capital Stock, earnings per share of Capital Stock, income, net income or profit (before or after taxes), economic profit, operating income, operating margin, profit margin, gross margins, return on equity or stockholder equity, total shareholder return, market capitalization, enterprise value, cash flow (including but not limited to operating cash flow and free cash flow), cash position, return on assets or net assets, return on capital, return on invested capital, return on sales, stockholder returns, economic value added, cash value added, earnings or net earnings (before or after interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), earnings from continuing operations, operating earnings, controllable profits, sales or revenues, sales growth, new orders, capital or investment, ratio of debt to debt plus equity, ratio of operating earnings to capital spending, new product innovation, product release schedules or ship targets, market share, cost reduction goals, inventory or supply chain management initiatives, budget comparisons, implementation or completion of specified projects or processes, customer satisfaction MBOs (management by objectives), productivity, expense, margins, operating efficiency, working capital, the formation of joint ventures, research or development collaborations, or the completion of other transactions, any other measure of financial performance that can be determined pursuant to GAAP, or any combination of any of the foregoing.
A Performance Measure (i) may relate to the performance of the Participant, MMI, Google, a Subsidiary of Google, the Company, any business group, business unit or other subdivision of the Company, or any combination of the foregoing, as the Committee deems appropriate and (ii) may be expressed as an amount, as an increase or decrease over a specified period, as a relative comparison to the performance of a group of comparator companies or a published or special index, or any other external measure of the selected performance criteria, as the Committee deems appropriate.

(f)
Committee Discretion
Nothing in this Section 9 is intended to limit the Committee's discretion to adopt conditions with respect to any Incentive Award that is not intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation. In addition, the Committee may, subject to the terms of the Plan, amend previously granted Incentive Awards in a way that disqualifies them as Performance-Based Compensation.
 
10.
Adjustment Upon Certain Changes
Subject to any action by the stockholders of Google required by law, applicable tax rules or the rules of any exchange on which shares of common stock of Google (for the avoidance of doubt, references herein to common stock of Google shall include Capital Stock) are listed for trading:
(a)
Shares Available for Grants
In the event of any change in the number or type of shares of common stock of Google outstanding by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares or similar corporate change, or any change in the type and number of shares of common stock of Google outstanding by reason of any other event or transaction, the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in the type and maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee may grant Incentive Awards, the type and maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee may grant Incentive Awards that are intended to be ISOs, and the type and maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee may grant Incentive Awards that are intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation to any Covered Employee in any calendar year.
(b)
Increase or Decrease in Issued Shares Without Consideration
In the event of any increase or decrease in the number or type of issued shares of common stock of Google resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of shares of common stock of Google or the payment of a stock dividend (but only on the shares of common stock of Google), or any other increase or decrease in the number of such shares effected without receipt or payment of consideration by the Company, the Committee shall appropriately adjust the type or number of shares subject to each outstanding Incentive Award and the exercise price per share, if any, of shares subject to each such Incentive Award.
(c)
Certain Mergers
In the event of any merger, consolidation or similar transaction as a result of which the holders of shares of Capital Stock receive consideration consisting exclusively of securities of the surviving corporation in such transaction, the Committee shall appropriately adjust each Incentive Award outstanding on the date of such merger or consolidation so that it pertains and applies to the securities which a holder of the number of shares of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive Award would have received in such merger or consolidation.
(d)
Certain Other Transactions
In the event of (i) a dissolution or liquidation of Google, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets (on a consolidated basis) or (iii) a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving Google in which the holders of shares of Capital Stock receive securities and/or other property, including cash, other than shares of the surviving corporation in such transaction, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, have the power to:
(A) cancel, effective immediately prior to the occurrence of such event, each Incentive Award (whether or not then exercisable or vested), and, in full consideration of such cancellation, pay to the Participant to whom such Incentive Award was granted an amount in cash, for each share of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive Award, equal to the value, as determined by the Committee, of such share of Capital Stock, provided that with respect to the shares of Capital Stock subject to any outstanding Option such value shall be equal to the excess of (1) the value, as determined by the Committee, of the property (including cash) received by the holder of a share of Capital Stock as a result of such event over (2) the exercise price of a share of Capital Stock subject to such Option; or
(B) provide for the exchange of each Incentive Award (whether or not then exercisable or vested) for an Incentive Award with respect to (1) some or all of the property which a holder of the number of shares of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive Award would have received in such transaction or (2) securities of the acquirer or surviving corporation, and, incident thereto, make an equitable adjustment as determined by the Committee in the exercise price per share, if any, of stock subject to the Incentive Award, or the number of shares or amount of property subject to the Incentive Award or provide for a payment (in cash or other property) to the Participant to whom such Incentive Award was granted in partial consideration for the exchange of the Incentive Award.
 
(e)
Other Changes
In the event of any change in the capitalization of Google or corporate change other than those specifically referred to in paragraphs 10(b), (c) or (d), including without limitation, any extraordinary cash dividend, spin-off, split-off, sale of a Subsidiary or business unit, or similar transaction, the Committee may make such adjustments in the issuer, number and class of shares subject to Stock Incentive Awards outstanding on the date on which such change occurs, such as, for example, a rollover of Stock Incentive Awards, and in such other terms of such Incentive Award, including without limitation in any Performance Schedule, Performance Target or Target Award, as the Committee may consider appropriate, provided that if any such Incentive Award is intended to be Performance-Based Compensation such adjustment is consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
(f)
Cash Incentive Awards
In the event of any transaction or event described in this Section 10, including without limitation any corporate change referred to in paragraph (e) hereof, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such adjustments in any Performance Schedule, Performance Target or Target Award, and in such other terms of any Cash Incentive Award, as the Committee may consider appropriate in respect of such transaction or event, provided that such adjustments must be consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
(g)
No Other Rights
Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no Participant shall have any rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any dividend, any increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class or any dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation of Google, MMI or any other corporation. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no issuance by Google of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of shares or amount of other property subject to, or the terms related to, any Incentive Award.
(h)
Savings Clause
No provision of this Section 10 shall be given effect to the extent that such provision would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
11.
Rights Under the Plan
No Person shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Capital Stock covered by or relating to any Incentive Award until the date of the issuance of such shares on the books and records of Google. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 10 hereof, no adjustment of any Incentive Award shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs prior to the date of such issuance. Nothing in this Section 11 is intended, or should be construed, to limit the authority of the Committee to cause the Company to make payments based on the dividends that would be payable with respect to any share of Capital Stock if it were issued or outstanding, or from granting rights related to such dividends.
The Company shall not have any obligation to establish any separate fund or trust or other segregation of assets to provide for payments under the Plan. To the extent any person acquires any rights to receive payments hereunder from the Company, such rights shall be no greater than those of an unsecured creditor.
