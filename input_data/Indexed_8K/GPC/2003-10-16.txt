EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Jerry W. Nix, Executive Vice President - Finance (770) 612-2048 GENUINE PARTS COMPANY REPORTS SALES AND EARNINGS FOR THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2003 Atlanta, Georgia, October 16, 2003 -- Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) reported sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003. Larry Prince, Chairman of the Board of Directors, announced today that sales totaling $2.2 billion were up 2% compared to the third quarter of 2002. Net income was $88 million, compared to $94 million for the third quarter of 2002. On a per share diluted basis, net income equaled $.51, compared to $.54 for the third quarter of 2002. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, sales totaled $6.4 billion, up 2% as compared to the same period in 2002. Net income for the nine months, before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles related to cash consideration from vendors and goodwill as discussed below, was $266.9 million compared to $277.1 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of 4%. On a per share diluted basis, net income for the period before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle equaled $1.53. After accounting changes recorded in the first quarter of 2003 and 2002 as discussed below, net income was $247 million this year compared to a net loss of $118 million in the same period of the previous year. Earnings were $1.42 compared to a loss of $.67 for the nine months in 2002. Mr. Prince stated: "As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board's EITF No. 02-16 related to the accounting treatment for cash consideration received from vendors. Under this new method, vendor allowances are generally considered a reduction in the cost of goods sold. As a result of EITF No. 02-16, a non-cash charge of $20 million was recorded as of January 1, 2003, representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. In addition, in the first quarter of 2002, we completed our impairment testing for goodwill in conjunction with the new provisions introduced in FASB Statement No. 142, resulting in a non-cash charge of $395 million."

Page 2 Mr. Prince further commented: "The Automotive Group improved revenues by 3% for the quarter and by 2% for the nine months. S. P. Richards, our office products company, was up 5% for the quarter and 4% for the nine months, showing steady improvement. Motion Industries, our industrial group, was down 3% for the quarter and down slightly for the nine months reflecting the contracting manufacturing economy and declining capacity utilization. EIS, our electrical group, was down 6% for the quarter and 8% for the nine months." Mr. Prince concluded, "We are pleased with the initiatives in each segment and we are committed to the execution of these plans. Our priorities will be continued gradual sales improvement with close attention to operating costs and margin improvement. We are also fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and financial condition to support our activities as we move forward." Mr. Prince added, "In the fourth quarter, we also plan to finalize the acquisition of the NAPA Hawaii business, a long-standing NAPA distributor headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii and with annual sales of approximately $35 million. The acquisition of NAPA Hawaii offers us excellent growth opportunities in their markets and we look forward to the contributions they will make to our Company."
