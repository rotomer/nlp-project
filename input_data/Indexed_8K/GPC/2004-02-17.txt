Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Atlanta, Georgia, February 17, 2004  Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) completed its 76th year of operations and reports sales and earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Sales in 2003 were $8.4 billion, up 2.3% compared to the previous year. Net income for the year, before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles related to cash consideration from vendors and goodwill as discussed below, was $354 million, compared to $368 million, for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of 4%. Diluted earnings per share, excluding the cumulative effect adjustments, were $2.03 versus $2.10 per share in 2002, a decrease of 3%. After accounting changes recorded in the first quarter of 2003 and 2002 as discussed below, net income was $334 million, or $1.91 diluted income per share, compared to a net loss of $27.6 million, or $.16 diluted loss per share in 2002.
Larry Prince, Chairman of the Board of Directors, stated, "Total sales for 2003 reached a new record level for us, exceeding our previous high set in the year 2000. We are disappointed that earnings before the cumulative effect adjustments were not on the plus side, given our sales improvement. While we were able to do a commendable job of expense control, our gross profit margins before the reclassification of vendor consideration were below those of the previous year and negatively impacted our earnings picture."
Mr. Prince added, "As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board's EITF No. 02-16 related to the accounting treatment for cash consideration received from vendors. Under this new method, vendor allowances are generally considered a reduction in the cost of goods sold. As a result of EITF No. 02-16, a non-cash charge of $20 million was recorded as of January 1, 2003, representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. In addition, in the first quarter of 2002, we completed our impairment testing for goodwill in conjunction with the new provisions introduced in FASB Statement No. 142, resulting in a non-cash charge of $395 million."
Fourth Quarter 2003
Sales increased 5% to $2.09 billion in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $1.99 billion for the same period in 2002. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $.50 compared to the prior year of $.52 per share, a decrease of 4%.

Mr. Prince commented, "For the quarter, revenues in our Automotive Group were up 6%, a strong finish to the year and we were pleased to see the positive impact of our sales initiatives. Motion Industries, our Industrial Group, increased sales by 2% for the fourth quarter, and S. P. Richards, our Office Products Group, had an increase of 4% for the quarter. Sales for EIS, our Electrical Group, were up slightly for the fourth quarter, their first comparative increase in quite some time."
Mr. Prince concluded, "We are optimistic that the stronger sales trend in the final quarter will carry over into 2004. GPC is in a position of market leadership in all our businesses, but we enter the new year with a determination and explicit plans to reach a higher level of growth."
