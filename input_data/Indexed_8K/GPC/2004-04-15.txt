EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Jerry W. Nix, Executive Vice President - Finance (770) 612-2048 GENUINE PARTS COMPANY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS Atlanta, Georgia, April 15, 2004 -- Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) reported sales and earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004. Larry Prince, Chairman of the Board of Directors, announced today that sales totaling $2.2 billion were up 9% compared to the first quarter of 2003. Net income for the quarter was $100.2 million, an increase of 13% over $88.4 million recorded in the previous year before the cumulative effect of an accounting change adopted January 1, 2003. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were 57 cents, up 12% compared to 51 cents for the first quarter last year before the accounting change. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's EITF 02-16 affecting the accounting treatment of cash consideration received from vendors, a non-cash charge of $20 million was recorded as of January 1, 2003, representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. After the cumulative effect adjustment in 2003, net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 was up 45% and diluted earnings per share were up 46% compared to the first quarter of 2003. Mr. Prince commented: "Our 9% sales gain is very encouraging and we like the fact that each of our four business segments had a successful first quarter. The Automotive Group reported strong results with a 10% increase in revenues for the quarter. Motion Industries, our Industrial Group, continued their trend of improvement with a 7% increase and EIS, our Electrical/Electronics Group, was strong with a 10% improvement. S. P. Richards, our Office Products Group, produced another steady performance with sales up 6% for the quarter." Mr. Prince concluded: "We believe the stronger pace of sales is being driven by our internal efforts and initiatives across all our businesses and we also sense that market conditions are making a turn for the better. Our operating margins and net earnings benefit from the additional revenue and our balance sheet also reflects this improvement." (Cont.)
