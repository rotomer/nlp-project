Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 15, 2004, the Board of Directors of Genuine Parts Company considered carefully the action by the Companys shareholders in approving by a majority vote at the Companys 2004 annual meeting a shareholder proposal challenging its shareholder rights plan, as well as considering other pertinent matters, and voted to terminate, effective November 30, 2004, certain rights associated with a previously authorized and declared dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each share of the Companys Common Stock outstanding on or issued after November 25, 1999, with each Right representing the right to purchase one ten-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock"). The Rights were subject to the terms and conditions of a Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated as of November 15, 1999 (the "Rights Agreement"), by and between the Company and SunTrust Bank, Atlanta, as Rights Agent. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement, the Boards action to terminate the Rights caused the Rights Agreement to simultaneously expire.

See the discussion under Item 1.02 regarding the termination of Rights associated with outstanding shares of the Companys common stock.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On November 15, 2004, the Board of Directors of Genuine Parts Company voted to amend the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to delete a prior amendment relating to the establishment and designation of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, thereby eliminating such series of preferred stock and reclassifying all of the former shares thereof (none of which have been issued) as undesignated preferred stock.

Election of Directors by Holders of Preferred Stock
9.6 .
