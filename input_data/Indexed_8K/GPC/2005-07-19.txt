FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Atlanta, Georgia, July 19, 2005  Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) reported record sales and earnings for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005. Tom Gallagher, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, announced today that sales totaling $2.5 billion were up 8% compared to the second quarter of 2004. Net income was $111.0 million, an increase of 10%, compared to $101.1 million for the second quarter of 2004. On a per share diluted basis, net income was 63 cents, up 9% compared to 58 cents for the second quarter last year.
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, sales totaled $4.8 billion, up 7% compared to the same period in 2004. Net income for the six months was $217.6 million, an increase of 8% over $201.3 million recorded in the previous year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.24, up 8% compared to $1.15 for the same period last year.
Mr. Gallagher stated: "Our overall results reflect the positive direction established in each of our businesses over the past eighteen months and all four of our business segments continue to contribute to the Company's success.
The strongest sales performance in the quarter came from Motion Industries, our Industrial Group. They were up 12% and business conditions remain favorable for the industrial operations. S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group, reported another period of consistent results with sales up 8%. The Automotive Group produced a solid 6% increase and EIS, our Electrical Group, was down 2% in the quarter. The EIS results reflect the impact of the sale of certain Electronic operations in the first quarter and the ongoing EIS business was actually up 5% in the period."

Mr. Gallagher further commented: "Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition and we continue to generate strong cash flows. We expect our working capital initiatives and earnings growth to further strengthen our financial position in the periods ahead."
Mr. Gallagher concluded: "We continue to maintain a positive outlook for each of our businesses for 2005. The demographics for the Automotive Aftermarket appear positive for some time to come, the manufacturing indices for Industrial and Electrical/Electronic remain strong and the increasing employment figures bode well for the Office Products Group. Our strategy is to continue to consistently execute our growth initiatives, in each of our businesses, in order to capitalize on these favorable market conditions. At the same time, we will be maintaining our expense control and asset management initiatives to meet our Sales and Earnings targets for 2005."
