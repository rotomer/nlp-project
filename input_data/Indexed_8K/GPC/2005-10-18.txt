FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Atlanta, Georgia, October 18, 2005  Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) reported record sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2005. Tom Gallagher, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, announced today that sales totaling $2.6 billion were up 9% compared to the third quarter of 2004. Net income was $110.9 million, an increase of 13%, compared to $97.9 million for the third quarter of 2004. On a per share diluted basis, net income was 63 cents, up 12.5% compared to 56 cents for the third quarter last year.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, sales totaled $7.4 billion, up 8% compared to the same period in 2004. Net income for the nine months was $328.4 million, an increase of 10% over $299.2 million recorded in the previous year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.87, up 9% compared to $1.71 for the same period last year.
Mr. Gallagher stated: "The third quarter was our strongest quarter thus far in 2005, and it continues the positive growth pattern we have experienced in each of our business segments dating back to early 2004.
Motion Industries, our Industrial Group, grew sales by 12%, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue increases for this group. S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group, had an 8% increase in sales, and this follows a 6% increase in the first quarter and an 8% increase in the second quarter. We are encouraged by another period of steady growth for this group. The Automotive Group produced its strongest quarter of the year, with sales up 8% in the third quarter after reporting increases of 4% and 6% in the first and second quarters, respectively. EIS, our Electrical Group, also contributed to our growth this quarter, with sales up 2%. Excluding the impact of the sale of their Circuit Supply division earlier this year, the on-going operations at EIS improved 10% in the period."

Mr. Gallagher further commented: "Our financial position has strengthened in 2005 through improvements in working capital and strong earnings growth. The balance sheet at September 30, 2005 remains in excellent condition and we continue to generate strong cash flows."
Mr. Gallagher concluded: "As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we continue to maintain a positive outlook on the growth opportunities for our businesses. Our initiatives in the Automotive Group are proving successful and the market conditions in the aftermarket remain favorable for us. In addition, the manufacturing indices for Industrial and Electrical/Electronic reflect continued expansion and the employment numbers for the service sector fit well with our initiatives in the Office Products Group. So, we feel good about the growth potential of the North American markets we serve and we will continue executing our strategies and initiatives to capitalize on this potential and finish the year strong."
