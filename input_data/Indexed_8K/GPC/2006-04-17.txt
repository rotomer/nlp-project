FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Atlanta, Georgia, April 17, 2006  Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) reported record sales and earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006. Thomas C. Gallagher, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, announced today that sales totaling $2.6 billion were up 9% compared to the first quarter of 2005. Net income for the quarter was $113.9 million, an increase of 7% over $106.6 million recorded in the same period of the previous year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were 66 cents, up 8% compared to 61 cents for the first quarter last year.
Mr. Gallagher commented, "We are pleased to report good sales and earnings growth for the first quarter of 2006. As has been the pattern for the past few years, each of our four business segments contributed to our overall sales growth for the quarter. Motion Industries, our Industrial Group, grew sales by 12%. This follows double-digit sales increases in 2005 and 2004 and we anticipate another good year from our industrial operations. The Automotive Group reported a 5% sales increase for the quarter. Within this group, the core NAPA business was actually a bit stronger, posting a 7% sales increase. S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group, generated a 13% sales increase for the quarter and EIS, our Electrical Group, was up 13% also."
Mr. Gallagher added, "The balance sheet at March 31, 2006 remains in excellent condition and we continue to strengthen our financial position through strong earnings growth and initiatives to improve working capital. The Company also continues to generate consistent and strong cash flows and our cash position is quite strong."
Mr. Gallagher concluded, "We are encouraged by the opportunity to have another good year in 2006. The outlook for continued growth in each of our businesses remains positive. Favorable market conditions combined with the proper execution of our growth initiatives should enable us to produce another year of steady sales growth and, in turn, solid earnings results."
