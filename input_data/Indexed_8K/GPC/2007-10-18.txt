FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Atlanta, Georgia, October 18, 2007  Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) reported increased sales and earnings for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007. Thomas C. Gallagher, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, announced today that sales totaling $2.80 billion were up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2006. Net income for the quarter was $128.6 million, an increase of 6% over $121.3 million recorded in the same period of the previous year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were 76 cents, up 7% compared to 71 cents for the third quarter last year.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, sales totaled $8.22 billion, up 4% compared to the same period in 2006. Net income for the nine months was $380.3 million, an increase of 7% over $355.9 million recorded in the previous year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $2.23, up 8% compared to $2.06 for the same period last year.
Mr. Gallagher stated, "We are pleased to report that the third quarter of 2007 was another period of steady and consistent sales and earnings growth for Genuine Parts Company. Motion Industries, our Industrial Group, once again generated the strongest revenue increase. They increased their sales 7% in the quarter and they continue to grow nicely. EIS, our Electrical Group, was up 4%, followed by Automotive, up 3% and Office Products up slightly, at .3%. The Automotive and Office Products segments continue to encounter sluggish business conditions, but we remain optimistic about their ability to show further improvement in the fourth quarter."
Mr. Gallagher added, "The balance sheet at September 30, 2007 remains in excellent condition and we continue to strengthen our financial position through steady and consistent earnings growth as well as through working capital and asset management initiatives. The Company also continues to generate superior cash flows and our cash position remains strong."
Mr. Gallagher concluded, "As we enter the fourth quarter, we are pleased to be in a position to report another year of steady and consistent sales and earnings growth for Genuine Parts Company.
