FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Atlanta, Georgia, February 19, 2008  Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) completed its 80th year of operations and reports record sales and earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Tom Gallagher, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, announced today that sales in 2007 were $10.84 billion, up 4% compared to 2006. Net income for the year was $506.3 million, an increase of 7% compared to $475.4 million in 2006. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $2.98, up 8% compared to $2.76 in 2006.
Mr. Gallagher stated, "We are pleased to report that 2007 was another year of record sales and earnings, marking 80 years of continued progress for Genuine Parts Company. The Company's strongest sales improvement came from our two business segments serving the manufacturing sector of the economy. Motion Industries, our Industrial Group, had another very good year, with sales increasing 8%, and EIS, our Electrical/Electronic Group, reported a 7% increase in sales for the year. The Automotive Group and S. P. Richards, our Office Products Group, encountered more difficult market circumstances, with Automotive increasing sales by 2% and our Office Group reporting a 1% sales decrease for the year."
Mr. Gallagher added, "With another record year behind us, we have now increased sales in 57 of the last 58 years and increased profits in 45 of the last 47 years. We are proud of this steady and consistent growth pattern and we are optimistic about our prospects for continued progress in the year ahead."
Fourth Quarter 2007
Sales increased 3% to $2.63 billion in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007, compared to $2.54 billion for the same period in 2006. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were 75 cents, up 7% compared to 70 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2006.
Mr. Gallagher commented, "In the fourth quarter of 2007, our Automotive Group sales were up 2%, our Industrial Group increased sales by 7%, our Electrical/Electronics Group was up 6% and our Office Products Group was down 1%. These results were in-line with our sales performance for the full year."
