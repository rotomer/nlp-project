I, Millard S. Drexler, state and attest that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    The Office of Management and Budget has approved this collection of information pursuant to 44 U.S.C.  3507 and 5 C.F.R.  1320.13. The OMB control number for this collection of information pursuant to this Order and Exhibit A is 3235-0569, and it expires on January 31, 2003. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number. The information will be used to provide greater assurance to the Commission and to investors that persons have not violated, or are not currently violating, the provisions of the federal securities laws governing corporate issuers' financial reporting and accounting practices, and to aid the Commission in assessing whether it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors for the Commission to adopt or amend rules and regulations governing corporate issuers' financial practices and/or for the Commission to recommend legislation to Congress concerning these matters. We estimate that providing the requested information will take, on average, approximately 25 hours. Any member of the public may direct to the Commission any comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing this burden. Responses to the collection of information are mandatory and will not be kept confidential.
