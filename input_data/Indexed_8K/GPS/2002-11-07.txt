SAN FRANCISCO  November 7, 2002  Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today reported sales of $1.2 billion for the four-week period ended November 2, 2002, compared with sales of $1.0 billion for the same period ended November 3, 2001, which represents a 17 percent increase. The company's comparable store sales for October 2002 were up 11 percent, compared to a 17 percent decrease in October 2001.
 
Comparable sales by division for October 2002 were as follows:
 
 
"Overall, October results across all brands significantly exceeded our beginning of month expectations," said CFO Heidi Kunz. "We saw a substantial increase in average unit retail, driven by greater regular price selling and higher markdown margins. Traffic was negative, but we did see improvement from prior months."
 
Third Quarter Sales Results
For the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2002, sales of $3.6 billion represent an increase of 9 percent compared with sales of $3.3 billion for the same period ended November 3, 2001. The company's third quarter comparable store sales increased 2 percent compared to a decrease of 17 percent in the third quarter of the prior year.
 
Comparable sales by division for the third quarter were as follows:
 
 
Year-to-date sales of $9.8 billion for the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2002 were flat compared to sales of $9.8 billion for the same period ended November 3, 2001. The company's year-to-date comparable store sales decreased 7 percent compared to a decrease of 11 percent in the prior year.
 
The company also announced it expects to report on November 14 a third quarter earnings per share of $0.12 to $0.14 due to the significant margin improvement in October. This exceeds the Thomson First Call consensus estimate of $0.06 per share.
 
Fourth Quarter Outlook
Regarding the impact of the West Coast port closure, the company said efforts to clear the inventory backlog have progressed more quickly than expected. However, the company still anticipates up to two- to four-week delays in some Holiday deliveries to stores.
 
"While it is difficult to assess the earnings risk related to the port closure, we anticipate the impact to fourth quarter will be in the middle of the $0.02 to $0.07 per share range previously given," said Ms. Kunz.
 
Commenting on the company's fourth quarter overall, Ms. Kunz said: "while we are pleased with October's results, our outlook remains cautious until we see more consistent performance over time."
 
As of November 2, 2002, Gap Inc. operated 4,294 store concepts compared to 4,147 store concepts last year, which represents an increase of 4 percent. The number of stores by location totaled 3,158 compared to 3,101 stores by location last year, which represents an increase of 2 percent.
