Guidance on Effective Tax Rate, Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings
 
The company also announced it expects its annual effective tax rate will be below the 47 percent rate it estimated during its third quarter earnings call.
 
"We now anticipate the new effective tax rate for the full fiscal year will be 39 to 42 percent," said Ms. Simmons. The company attributed this change to improvement in the mix of earnings in domestic and international operations, improved earnings performance and favorable resolution of several tax audits in the quarter.
 
Commenting on fourth quarter earnings and the impact of the tax rate change, Ms. Simmons said: "We expect to report fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.29 applying a tax rate range of 39 to 42 percent. At a tax rate of 47 percent, estimated fourth quarter earnings per share would have been $0.19 to $0.22."
 
Commenting on fiscal 2002 year-end earnings Ms. Simmons said: "We expect year-end earnings per share to be $0.51 to $0.57."
 
Gap Inc. will make its fourth quarter earnings and year-end announcement on Thursday, February 27, following the market close.
