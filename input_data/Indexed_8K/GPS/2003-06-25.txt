Each such notice of a Borrowing (a "Notice of Borrowing") shall be by telecopier or telephone (and if by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing), in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial Interest Period for each such Advance. Each Lender shall, before 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 10.02 hereof, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing. After the Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article V, the Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address. (b) (i) Each Swing Line Advance shall be made on such notice and on such terms (subject to the provisions of Section 2.05(b) hereof) as are agreed to from time to time between the respective Subsidiary Borrower and the respective Swing Line Lender. Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article V, the respective Swing Line Lender will make such funds available to the respective Subsidiary Borrower. No later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, each Swing Line Lender shall deliver to the Agent a report as to the outstanding amount of Swing Line Advances by such Swing Line Lender as of the end of such quarter and the identity of the respective Subsidiary Borrower. In addition, each Swing Line Lender will provide such information as to the Swing Line Advances made by such Swing Line Lender as is requested by the Agent from time to time. (ii) Upon demand by the respective Swing Line Lender, with a copy of such demand to the Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to each Lender), each Lender shall purchase from such Swing Line Lender, and such Swing Line Lender shall sell and assign to each such Lender, such Lender's ratable share (as determined by reference to such Lender's Commitment Percentage) of any outstanding Swing Line Advance by such Swing Line Lender 23
as of the date of such demand, by making available to the respective Swing Line Lender, an amount equal to such ratable share. If such Swing Line Advance is denominated in an Alternative Currency, the payment to be made by the Lenders pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be Converted into Dollars by the Swing Line Lender at a rate determined by such Swing Line Lender as provided in Section 3.12(a) hereof. Each Lender hereby agrees to purchase its ratable share of an outstanding Swing Line Advance on (A) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by the respective Swing Line Lender so long as notice of such demand is given not later than one Business Day prior to such Business Day or (B) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. The respective Subsidiary Borrower, hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Upon any such assignment by the respective Swing Line Lender to any Lender of a portion of a Swing Line Advance, the respective Swing Line Lender represents and warrants to such Lender that such Swing Line Lender is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to such Swing Line Advance, the Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made its ratable share of any applicable Swing Line Advance available to the respective Swing Line Lender in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.02(b)(ii), such Lender hereby agrees to pay to the respective Swing Line Lender forthwith on demand the amount of its ratable share, together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by such Swing Line Lender therefor until the date such amount is paid to such Swing Line Lender, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to such Swing Line Lender the amount of its ratable share on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for all purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Advance made by the respective Swing Line Lender shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day. (iii) The obligation of each Lender to purchase its ratable share of each outstanding Swing Line Advance upon demand by the respective Swing Line Lender therefor pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 2.02(b) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be made strictly in accordance with the terms of clause (ii) of this Section 2.02(b) under all circumstances, including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; (B) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that such Lender may have at any time against the respective Swing Line Lender, the respective Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person, whether in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or any unrelated transaction; 24
(C) the occurrence and continuance of any Default or Event of Default; (D) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; or (E) the failure of the respective Subsidiary Borrower to comply with the applicable conditions set forth in Article V. (c) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than $1,000,000 multiplied by the number of Lenders. (d) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower or the respective Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be. In the case of any Borrowing which the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article V, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Eurodollar Rate Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date. (e) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender (i) in the case of any Borrowing consisting of (A) Eurodollar Rate Advances or (B) Base Rate Advances for which the Notice of Borrowing is given other than on the date thereof, prior to the date of such Borrowing or (ii) in the case of any Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances for which the Notice of Borrowing is given on the date thereof, prior to the time at which such Lender is required to fund such Borrowing, which notice shall in either case state that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower or the respective Subsidiary Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower or the respective Subsidiary Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower or the respective Subsidiary Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent at (x) in the case of the Borrower or the respective Subsidiary Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (y) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. 25
(f) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. (g) The Borrower shall, if requested by any Lender, execute and deliver a promissory note, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, payable to the order of such Lender in an original principal amount equal to such Lender's Commitment, duly executed by the Borrower. SECTION 2.03 Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, from the date hereof in the case of each initial Lender and from the effective date specified in the Assumption Agreement or in the Assignment and Acceptance, respectively, pursuant to which it became Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Facility Fee in effect from time to time, (i) on the amount of such Lender's Commitment (computed without giving effect to any usage of the Commitment of such Lender), payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each January, April, July and October and on the Termination Date; and (ii) on the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Liability under all Letters of Credit that are outstanding beyond the Termination Date (regardless of the actual or deemed usage thereof) payable in arrears on the last day of each January, April, July and October after the Termination Date and on the first day after the Termination Date on which no Letters of Credit are outstanding.

(c) Other Fees. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay the fees and charges referred to in that certain letter agreement, dated as of the date hereof, among the Borrower, the Issuing Banks and the Agent. SECTION 2.04 Reduction and Increase of the Commitments; Reduction and Increase of the Swing Line Commitment; Additional Issuing Banks. (a) The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Agent, to irrevocably terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portions of the respective Commitments of the Lenders, provided, that, after giving effect to such reduction, the Commitments are not less than the sum of the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liability, the aggregate Swing Line Commitment then in effect (computed without giving regard to usage), and the then outstanding amount of all Borrowings; provided, further, that, each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. 26

(c) Not more frequently than twice in any calendar year, the Borrower shall have the right prior to the Termination Date to (i) increase the amount of the Commitments of one or more Lenders (subject to the consent of such Lenders in their sole and absolute discretion), (ii) add one or more Assuming Lenders as Lenders (subject to the consent of the Agent and the Issuing Banks in their sole and absolute discretion) and (iii) increase the Issuing Commitment of an Issuing Bank (subject to the consent of such Issuing Bank in its sole and absolute discretion) (each such increase under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) being a "Commitment Increase"), on and subject to the following terms: (i) The aggregate amount of the increase in the Commitments shall not exceed $100,000,000 after the date hereof; (ii) The amount of each Commitment Increase by any Lender or any Assuming Lender shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

(iv) Promptly following its receipt of a Commitment Increase Notice in proper form, the Agent shall deliver copies thereof to each Lender and Issuing Bank. If, and only if, all of the terms, conditions and requirements specified in paragraphs (i) through (iv) are satisfied in respect of any proposed Commitment Increase on and as of the proposed Commitment Increase Effective Date thereof and in the case of each such Assuming Lender, an Assumption Agreement, duly executed by such Assuming Lender, the Agent and the Borrower, has been received by the Agent, then, as of such Commitment Increase Effective Date and from and after such date, (1) the Commitments of the Lenders consenting to such Commitment Increase shall be increased by the respective amounts specified in the Commitment Increase Notice pertaining thereto, (2) references herein to the amounts of the Lenders' respective Commitments shall refer to respective amounts giving effect to such Commitment Increase, and (3) each such Assuming Lender shall be a Lender and Issuing Bank, if applicable, for all purposes hereof, and the Agent shall record all relevant information with respect to such Assuming Lender and its Commitment and, if applicable, with respect to any increased Issuing Commitment of an Issuing Bank in the Register; 28
(v) It is understood that no Lender or Issuing Bank shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the Borrower for a Commitment Increase; (vi) As part of such Commitment Increase, such Lender or Assuming Lender shall purchase assignments in the Advances and Commitments of the other Lenders so that after giving effect thereto, the percentage held by each Lender of the aggregate Commitments is the same as prior to such Commitment Increase and such Lender or Assuming Lender shall have acquired a ratable participation in all Swing Line Advances as contemplated by Section 2.02(b) hereof. In connection therewith, on each Commitment Increase Effective Date, (A) each Lender whose Commitment has been increased (each such Lender being an "Increasing Lender") shall, before 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such Commitment Increase Effective Date, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the address specified in Section 10.02 hereof, in same day funds, an amount equal to the excess of (1) such Increasing Lender's ratable portion of the Advances then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders (including each such Assuming Lender) outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) over (2) the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Advances made by such Increasing Lender and (B) each such Assuming Lender shall before 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such Commitment Increase Effective Date, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the address specified in Section 10.02 hereof in same day funds, an amount equal to such Assuming Lender's ratable portion of the Advances then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders (including each such Assuming Lender) outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase); and (vii) After the Agent's receipt of such funds from each such Increasing Lender and such Assuming Lender, the Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds to the other Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices in an amount to each other Lender such that the aggregate amount of the outstanding Advances owing to each Lender (including each such Assuming Lender) after giving effect to such distribution equals such Lender's ratable portion of the Advances then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase). (d) The Borrower may at any time, upon at least five Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent and the Lenders or as part of a proposed Commitment Increase pursuant to this Section 2.04, designate (i) as an Issuing Bank any Lender that has agreed in writing to act as an Issuing Bank and (ii) the Issuing Commitment of such Lender. Thereupon, any Lender so designated as an Issuing Bank shall thenceforth issue Letters of Credit on the terms and subject to the conditions herein, and the Agent shall 29
record all relevant information with respect to such Lender as such Issuing Bank in the Register. SECTION 2.05 Repayment of Advances. (a) The Borrower shall repay in full the principal amount of each Advance made pursuant to Section 2.01(a) hereof owing to each Lender, together with accrued interest and fees thereon, on the Termination Date.

SECTION 2.06 Interest on Advances. The Borrower or the respective Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made by each Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum: (a) Base Rate Advances. If such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (y) the respective Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable quarterly on the last day of each April, July, October, and January and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full; provided, that, any amount of principal which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest, from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such principal amount become due. (b) Eurodollar Rate Advances. If such Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (x) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus (y) the respective Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day which occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period; provided, that, any amount of principal which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest, from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Advance (as if such Advance were a Base Rate Advance) immediately prior to the date on which such principal amount became due.

SECTION 2.07 Additional Interest on Eurodollar Rate Advances. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, so long as such Lender shall be required under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Lender, from the date of such Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at an interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period for such Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest Period, payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Advance. Such additional interest shall be determined by such Lender and notified to the Borrower through the Agent. SECTION 2.08 Interest Rate Determination. (a) Each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Agent timely information for the purpose of determining the Eurodollar Rate. If any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Agent for the purpose of determining such interest rate, the Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks. The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section 2.06(a) or (b) hereof, and the applicable rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the applicable interest rate under Section 2.06(b) hereof. (b) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Majority Lenders notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon: (i) each outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance, and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. (c) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01 hereof, the Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances. (d) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $1,000,000 multiplied by the number of Lenders, such Advances shall, if they are Advances of a Type other than Base Rate Advances, automatically Convert on the 31
last day of the Interest Period with respect to such Advance into Base Rate Advances, and on and after such date the right of the Borrower to Convert such Advances into Advances of a Type other than Base Rate Advances shall terminate; provided, however, that if and so long as each such Advance shall be of the same Type and have the same Interest Period as Advances comprising another Borrowing or other Borrowings, and the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all such Advances shall equal or exceed $1,000,000 multiplied by the number of Lenders, the Borrower shall have the right to continue all such Advances as, or to Convert all such Advances into, Advances of such Type having such Interest Period. (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligations of the Lenders to make, or to convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances will be suspended. (f) If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information to the Agent for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Eurodollar Rate Advances, (i) the Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such Eurodollar Rate Advances, (ii) each such Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and (iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. SECTION 2.09 Voluntary Conversion of Advances. The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08 and 2.12 hereof, Convert all Advances of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances of another Type; provided, however, that any Conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Advances into Advances of another Type shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances. Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the Interest Period for each such Advance. SECTION 2.10 Prepayments of Advances. (a) The Borrower may (i) upon at least two Business Days', in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances and (ii) on the same Business Day, in the case of Base Rate Advances, notice to the Agent (to be received by the Agent prior to 12:00 noon (New 32
York City time)) stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid (provided that any prepayment in connection with the termination and refinancing of this Agreement may be conditioned on the closing of such refinancing); provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than $10,000,000 if made with respect to Eurodollar Rate Advances, or $1,000,000, if made with respect to Base Rate Advances, and in each case in $1,000,000 integral multiples in excess thereof and (y) in the case of any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 10.04(b) hereof. (b) The right of any Subsidiary Borrower to prepay any Swing Line Advance shall be as set forth in an agreement between the respective Swing Line Lender and the respective Subsidiary Borrower. SECTION 2.11 Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change at any time after the date of this Agreement (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance after the date of this Agreement with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost (other than an increase in taxes, which increase is dealt with exclusively in Article IV) to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost; provided, that, the Borrower shall have no obligation to reimburse any Lender for increased costs incurred more than 60 days prior to the date of such demand. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost setting forth the basis for the calculation of such increased costs, submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) If, at any time after the date of this Agreement, any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder; provided, that, the Borrower shall have no obligation to pay such compensatory amounts 33
that relate to an actual increase in the capital of such Lender undertaken by such Lender more than 60 days prior to the date of such demand. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender and setting forth the basis for the calculation of such amount shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) Without affecting its rights under Sections 2.11(a) or 2.11(b) hereof or any other provision of this Agreement, each Lender agrees that if there is any increase in any cost to or reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender with respect to which the Borrower would be obligated to compensate such Lender pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) or 2.11(b) hereof, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to select an alternative Applicable Lending Office which would not result in any such increase in any cost to or reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender; provided, however, that no Lender shall be obligated to select an alternative Applicable Lending Office if such Lender determines that (i) as a result of such selection such Lender would be in violation of any applicable law, regulation, treaty, or guideline, or would incur additional costs or expenses or (ii) such selection would be inadvisable for regulatory reasons or inconsistent with the interests of such Lender. (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.11 shall survive the payment in full (after the Termination Date) of all Obligations. SECTION 2.12 Illegality. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful or impossible, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and (ii) the Borrower shall forthwith prepay in full all Eurodollar Rate Advances of all Lenders then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon, unless the Borrower, within five Business Days of notice from the Agent, Converts all Eurodollar Rate Advances of all Lenders then outstanding into Advances of another Type in accordance with Section 2.09 hereof. (b) Without affecting its rights under Section 2.12(a) hereof or under any other provision of this Agreement, each Lender agrees that if it becomes unlawful or impossible for such Lender to make, maintain or fund its Eurodollar Rate Advances as contemplated by this Agreement, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to select an alternative Applicable Lending Office from which such Lender may maintain and give effect to its obligations under this Agreement with respect to making, funding and maintaining such Eurodollar Rate Advances; provided, however, that no Lender shall be obligated to select an alternative Applicable Lending Office if such Lender determines that (i) as a result of such selection such Lender would be in violation of any applicable law, regulation, or treaty, or would incur additional costs or expenses or (ii) such 34
selection would be inadvisable for regulatory reasons or inconsistent with the interests of such Lender. SECTION 2.13 Borrower Guaranty. (a) Generally.

(b) Guaranty. (i) The Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Subsidiary Borrowers now or hereafter existing under this Agreement with respect to the Swing Line Advances issued for the account of any of the Subsidiary Borrowers, including any extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments and renewals thereof, whether for repayment obligations, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise (such obligations being the "Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses in accordance with Section 10.04 hereof) incurred by the Swing Line Lenders or the Lenders in enforcing any rights hereunder with respect to the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower's liability shall extend to all amounts which constitute part of the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations and would be owed by any Subsidiary Borrower to the Swing Line Lenders or the Lenders hereunder, or under the Swing Line Advances issued for the account of a Subsidiary Borrower, but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such Subsidiary Borrower. (ii) The Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due of all obligations of the Hedge Subsidiaries now or hereafter existing under any Hedge Agreements entered into by a Hedge Subsidiary with a Hedge Bank, including any extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments and renewals thereof (such obligations being the "Hedge Subsidiary Obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses in accordance with Section 10.04 hereof) incurred by the Hedge Banks in enforcing any rights thereunder with respect to the Hedge Subsidiary Obligations.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower's liability shall extend to all amounts which constitute part of the Subsidiary Operating Indebtedness Obligations and would be owed by any such Subsidiary to the respective Operating Lender thereunder, but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such Subsidiary. (c) Guaranty Absolute. The Borrower guarantees that the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations, Hedge Subsidiary Obligations and Subsidiary Operating Indebtedness Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with their respective terms, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Swing Line Lenders, the Lenders, the Hedge Banks or the Operating Lenders, respectively, with respect thereto. The obligations of the Borrower hereunder are independent of the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations, Hedge Subsidiary Obligations and Subsidiary Operating Indebtedness Obligations and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Borrower to enforce the guaranty contained in this Section 2.13, irrespective of whether any action is brought against any Subsidiary Borrower or Hedge Subsidiary or Subsidiary of the Borrower party to an Operating Indebtedness Agreement or whether any Subsidiary Borrower or Hedge Subsidiary or such Subsidiary is joined in any such action or actions. The liability of the Borrower under the guaranty contained in this Section 2.13 shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any of the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations, Hedge Subsidiary Obligations, Subsidiary Operating Indebtedness Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto against any Swing Line Borrower, Hedge Subsidiary, such Subsidiary of the Borrower or any other Person; (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations or of the Hedge Subsidiary Obligations or of the Subsidiary Operating Indebtedness Obligations or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure with respect to Swing Line Advances issued for the account of a Subsidiary Borrower or with 36
respect to Hedge Agreements entered into by any Hedge Subsidiary or with respect to Operating Indebtedness Agreements entered into by any such Subsidiary of the Borrower including, without limitation, any increase in the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations resulting from the Issuance of Swing Line Advances beyond the aggregate limitation specified in Section 2.01 hereof to any and all Subsidiary Borrowers or otherwise; (iii) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations or of the Hedge Subsidiary Obligations or of the Subsidiary Operating Indebtedness Obligations; (iv) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations or of the Hedge Subsidiary Obligations or of the Subsidiary Operating Indebtedness Obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations or of the Hedge Subsidiary Obligations or of the Subsidiary Operating Indebtedness Obligations or any other assets of a Subsidiary Borrower or a Hedge Subsidiary or such Subsidiary of the Borrower; (v) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of a Subsidiary Borrower or a Hedge Subsidiary or such Subsidiary of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower's or any Hedge Subsidiary's or any such Subsidiary's lack of corporate power or authority; or (vi) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, a third party guarantor. The guaranty provided in this Section 2.13 shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Subsidiary Swing Line Obligations or the Hedge Subsidiary Obligations or the Subsidiary Operating Indebtedness Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Swing Line Lender, any Lender, any Hedge Bank or any Operating Lender, respectively, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of a Subsidiary Borrower, a Hedge Subsidiary or any such Subsidiary of the Borrower, as the case may be, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

(b) Capital. If, at any time after the date of this Agreement, an Issuing Bank or any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Issuing Bank or such Lender or any corporation controlling such Issuing Bank or such Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Issuing Bank's or Lender's commitment hereunder and other commitments of this type or the issuance of (or commitment to purchase of participations in) the Letters of Credit (or similar contingent obligations), then, upon written demand by such Issuing Bank or such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank or such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Issuing Bank or such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Issuing Bank or such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Issuing Bank or such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Issuing Bank's or such Lender's commitment hereunder; provided, that, the Borrower shall have no obligation to pay such compensatory amounts that relate to an actual increase in the capital of such Issuing Bank or such Lender undertaken by such Issuing 45
Bank or such Lender more than 60 days prior to the date of such demand. A certificate as to such amounts setting forth the basis for the calculation of such amount submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by an Issuing Bank or a Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 3.08 shall survive the payment in full (after the Termination Date) of all Obligations. (d) Without affecting its rights under Sections 3.08(a) or 3.08(b) or any other provision of this Agreement, the Issuing Banks and each Lender agree that if there is any increase in any cost to or reduction in any amount receivable by the respective Issuing Bank or Lender with respect to which the Borrower would be obligated to compensate such Lender pursuant to Sections 3.08(a) or 3.08(b) hereof, the respective Issuing Bank or Lender shall use reasonable efforts to select an alternative issuing office or Applicable Lending Office, as the case may be, which would not result in any such increase in any cost to or reduction in any amount receivable by such Issuing Bank or such Lender; provided, however, that the Issuing Banks and each Lender shall not be obligated to select an alternative issuing office or Applicable Lending Office if the respective Issuing Bank or such Lender determines that (i) as a result of such selection such Issuing Bank or such Lender would be in violation of any applicable law, regulation, treaty, or guideline, or would incur additional costs or expenses or (ii) such selection would be inadvisable for regulatory reasons or inconsistent with the interests of such Issuing Bank or such Lender. SECTION 3.09 Uniform Customs and Practice.

(b) The Borrower may at any time, upon at least five Business Days' prior written notice to the respective Issuing Bank and the Agent, increase the Issuing Commitment of an Issuing Bank and at the same time reduce by an equivalent amount the Issuing Commitment of one or more of the other Issuing Banks; provided, that such notice is consented to by each Issuing Bank affected by such increase and decrease and provided, further, that the Agent shall record each such increase and decrease of the Issuing Commitment of the respective Issuing Bank in the Register. SECTION 3.11 Existing Letters of Credit. There currently are outstanding certain Standby Letters of Credit issued pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement (collectively, 46
the "Existing Letters of Credit"), the outstanding balance of each of which is set forth on Schedule IV hereto (as such Schedule may be modified between the date hereof and the fifth Business Day after the Effective Date). From and after the date hereof and upon fulfillment of the conditions to initial Issuance specified in Section 5.01 hereof, each such Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed and treated for all purposes hereof (including, without limitation, the calculation of fees payable under Section 3.06 hereof, and calculating the usage of the respective Issuing Bank's commitment under Section 3.01 hereof) as a "Letter of Credit" hereunder, any participation interest existing prior to the date hereof of any Lender in such Existing Letters of Credit shall, without further action on its part, be deemed extinguished in full and each Lender, without further act on its part, shall be deemed to have purchased a participation in each such Existing Letter of Credit as provided in Section 3.05 hereof in accordance with its Commitment Percentage. SECTION 3.12 Currency Provisions. (a) Equivalents. For purposes of the provisions of Article II and III, (i) the equivalent in Dollars of any Alternative Currency shall be determined by using the mean of the bid and offer quoted spot rates at which the respective Issuing Bank's or Swing Line Lender's principal office in New York, New York offers to exchange Dollars for such Alternative Currency in New York, New York at 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day on which such equivalent is to be determined and (ii) the equivalent in any Alternative Currency of Dollars shall be determined by using the mean of the bid and offer quoted spot rates at which such Issuing Bank's or Swing Line Lender's principal office in New York, New York offers to exchange such Alternative Currency for Dollars in New York, New York at 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day on which such equivalent is to be determined. (b) Issuing Banks' Commitment/Lenders' Commitments. For purposes of determining the unused portion of an Issuing Bank's Issuing Commitment specified in Section 3.01 and of each Lender's Commitment, the equivalent in Dollars of each Letter of Credit issued by an Issuing Bank in an Alternative Currency as determined on the date of the Issuance of such Letter of Credit shall be the amount of such Issuing Bank's Issuing Commitment used in connection with the Issuance of such Letter of Credit and the resulting proportionate amount of each Lender's Commitment used, such reduction to be calculated in accordance with its Commitment Percentage. Further adjustments shall be made with respect to the unused portion of an Issuing Bank's Issuing Commitment to Issue Letters of Credit and each such Lender's Commitment based upon fluctuations thereafter in the value of the Alternative Currency of such Letter of Credit as provided in subsection (c) below. (c) Mark to Market. If, on any day, the equivalent in Dollars of the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding (less the aggregate amount of cash collateral held by all the Issuing Banks with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit) exceeds the total of (x) the Commitments then in effect minus (y) the sum of the then outstanding aggregate amount of all Borrowings and the aggregate Swing Line Commitment then in effect (computed without giving regard to usage), the Borrower shall, upon demand by the Agent, immediately deposit into the L/C Collateral Account 47
(as defined in the Security Agreement) held by the Collateral Agent, in Dollars, (i) the Dollar amount of such excess plus (ii) a Dollar amount equal to the lesser of (A) $1,000,000 and (B) 10% of the Dollar equivalent of all then existing Letter of Credit Liability relating to Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies, which amount shall be held by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Security Agreement as cash collateral for the Borrowers' and LC Subsidiaries' obligations with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit. Amounts on deposit with the Collateral Agent as cash collateral in the L/C Collateral Account shall be invested as provided in the Security Agreement and shall (so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing) be released to the Borrower (1) if the Termination Date has not occurred, on the date on which the aggregate of all Letter of Credit Liability does not exceed 99% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments then in effect (without regard to any usage thereof) minus the sum of the then outstanding aggregate amount of all Borrowings and the aggregate Swing Line Commitment then in effect (computed without giving regard to usage), or (2) if the Termination Date has occurred, in accordance with Section 3.15 hereof. (d) Monthly Report. Each Issuing Bank, on the last Business Day of each month until the Termination Date, shall calculate the Letter of Credit Liability on such date (converting any amounts of the Letter of Credit Liability which are denominated in an Alternative Currency to Dollars for purposes of such calculation) and shall promptly send notice of such Letter of Credit Liability to the Agent, the Borrower and each Lender, and the Agent shall then determine the excess amount, if any, referred to in the first sentence of Section 3.12(c) above and shall promptly inform the Borrower of such amount and the Borrower shall promptly upon receipt thereof make the payments provided for in Section 3.12(c) above if applicable. SECTION 3.13 Borrower Guaranty. (a) Generally. The Issuing Banks may, from time to time, Issue Letters of Credit for the account of each LC Subsidiary provided, that, the reimbursement and other obligations of each such LC Subsidiary are and remain unconditionally guaranteed by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.13. (b) Guaranty. The Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the LC Subsidiaries now or hereafter existing under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued for the account of any of the LC Subsidiaries, including any extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments and renewals thereof, whether for reimbursement obligations, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise (such obligations being the "Subsidiary LC Obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses in accordance with Section 10.04 hereof) incurred by the Issuing Banks or the Lenders in enforcing any rights hereunder with respect to the Subsidiary Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower's liability shall extend to all amounts which constitute part of the Subsidiary LC Obligations and would be owed by any LC Subsidiary to the Issuing Banks or the Lenders hereunder, or under the Letters of Credit issued for the account of an LC Subsidiary, but for the fact that they are unenforceable or 48
not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such LC Subsidiary. (c) Guaranty Absolute. The Borrower guarantees that the Subsidiary LC Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms hereof regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Issuing Banks or the Lenders with respect thereto. The obligations of the Borrower hereunder are independent of the Subsidiary LC Obligations and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Borrower to enforce the guaranty contained in this Section 3.13, irrespective of whether any action is brought against any LC Subsidiary or whether any LC Subsidiary is joined in any such action or actions. The liability of the Borrower under the guaranty contained in this Section 3.13 shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any of the Subsidiary LC Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto against any LC Subsidiary or any other Person; (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Subsidiary Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure herefrom with respect to Letters of Credit issued for the account of an LC Subsidiary including, without limitation, any increase in the Subsidiary LC Obligations resulting from the Issuance of Letters of Credit beyond the aggregate limitation specified in Section 3.01 hereof to any and all LC Subsidiaries or otherwise; (iii) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Subsidiary Obligations; (iv) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Subsidiary Obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Subsidiary LC Obligations or any other assets of an LC Subsidiary; (v) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of an LC Subsidiary or any LC Subsidiary's lack of corporate power or authority; or (vi) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, a third party guarantor. The guaranty provided in this Section 3.13 shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Subsidiary LC Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Issuing Banks or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of an LC Subsidiary or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 49
(d) Waivers. The Borrower hereby waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) any requirement that the Issuing Banks or any Lender secure or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any LC Subsidiary or any other Person or any collateral; (ii) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Issuing Banks or any Lender (including, without limitation, an election to nonjudicially foreclose on any real or personal property collateral) which in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects its subrogation, reimbursement or contribution rights or other rights to proceed against any LC Subsidiary or any other Person or any collateral; (iii) any defense arising by reason of the failure of any LC Subsidiary to properly execute any letter of credit application and agreement or otherwise comply with applicable legal formalities; (iv) any defense or benefits that may be derived from California Civil Code Sections 2808, 2809, 2810, 2819, 2845 or 2850, or California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a, 580d or 726, or comparable provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction and all other suretyship defenses it would otherwise have under the laws of California or any other jurisdiction; (v) any duty on the part of the Issuing Banks or any Lender to disclose to the Borrower any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operation or condition of any LC Subsidiary and its respective assets now known or hereafter known by the Issuing Banks or any Lender; (vi) all benefits of any statute of limitations affecting the Borrower's liability under or the enforcement of the guaranty provided in this Section 3.13 or any of the Subsidiary LC Obligations or any collateral; (vii) all setoffs and counterclaims; (viii) promptness, diligence, presentment, demand for performance and protest; (ix) notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor; (x) except for any notice otherwise required by applicable laws that may not be effectively waived by the Borrower, notice of sale or other disposition of any collateral; and 50
(xi) notice of acceptance of the guaranty provided in this Section 3.13 and of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Subsidiary Obligations. SECTION 3.14 Dollar Payment Obligation. Notwithstanding any other term or provision hereof to the contrary, if the Borrower or any LC Subsidiary fails to reimburse the respective Issuing Bank for any payment made by such Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency by the close of business on the Business Day when due at the Payment Office specified for such reimbursement payment, then the payment made by such Issuing Bank in such Alternative Currency shall be converted into Dollars (the "Dollar Payment Amount") by such Issuing Bank as provided for herein, and each of the Borrower and each LC Subsidiary for whose account such Letter of Credit was Issued agrees that it shall be unconditionally obligated to, and shall immediately, reimburse such Issuing Bank the Dollar Payment Amount at such Issuing Bank's then Payment Office for Dollars. SECTION 3.15 Applications; Survival of Provisions; Cash Collateral. This Agreement shall control over any provision of any application and agreement for Letters of Credit to the contrary, but additive or supplemental provisions of any such application and agreement shall apply to each Letter of Credit Issued pursuant to such application and agreement. The provisions in this Article shall survive the Termination Date in respect of all Letters of Credit outstanding thereafter. On the Termination Date, the Borrower shall deposit into the L/C Collateral Account (as defined in the Security Agreement) held by the Collateral Agent cash (in Dollars) in an amount equal to the undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit as security for the reimbursement of drawings thereunder which shall be used to reimburse the respective Issuing Bank promptly upon a drawing under its respective Letter of Credit, with the respective portion thereof to be returned to the Borrower when the respective Letter of Credit expires, and in connection therewith the Borrower shall execute all documents as reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the Security Agreement. SECTION 3.16 LC Subsidiaries. Any Subsidiary of the Borrower not an LC Subsidiary on the date hereof may become an "LC Subsidiary" hereunder by delivering to the respective Issuing Bank (which shall promptly forward a copy thereof to each Lender and the Agent) an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to such Issuing Bank, wherein such Subsidiary agrees to be bound by all terms and provisions of this Agreement relating to Letters of Credit to be issued for the account of such Subsidiary and delivers a written consent of the Borrower assenting to the inclusion of such Subsidiary as an "LC Subsidiary" hereunder. Unless objected to by the Majority Lenders within the 10 day period referred to below, such Subsidiary shall become an "LC Subsidiary" hereunder 10 days after such Issuing Bank notifies the Borrower that such agreement and consent are in form and substance satisfactory to it; provided, that, no Subsidiary shall become an "LC Subsidiary" until such Issuing Bank shall have notified the Borrower in writing that such agreement and consent are in form and substance satisfactory to such Issuing Bank. 51
ARTICLE IV PAYMENTS, TAXES, EXTENSIONS, ETC. SECTION 4.01 Payments and Computations/Borrowings. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.02 hereof, the Borrower and each Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, shall make each payment hereunder with respect to Article II, the Advances, the Lenders and the Agent free and clear of all claims, charges, offsets or deductions whatsoever not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 10.02 hereof in same day funds. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or facility or utilization fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.04(c), 2.07, 2.11 or 4.02 hereof) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to such Lender to be distributed to the appropriate Lender or Lenders and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 10.07(d) hereof, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b) The Borrower, each Subsidiary Borrower and each LC Subsidiary hereby authorize the Agent and each Lender if and to the extent payment owed to the Agent or such Lender is not paid when due hereunder to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower's, such Subsidiary Borrower's or such LC Subsidiary's accounts with the Agent or such Lender any amount so due (it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to the contrary, accounts, deposits, sums, securities or other property of any Foreign Subsidiary or of any Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary (including any Foreign Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Borrower or LC Subsidiary) will not serve at any time, directly or indirectly, to collateralize or otherwise offset the Obligations of the Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary, and, in addition, unless otherwise agreed to by the Borrower, the accounts, deposits, sums, securities or other property of a Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary will only serve to collateralize or offset the Obligations of another Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Borrower or LC Subsidiary if such former Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary is owned by such latter Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Borrower or LC Subsidiary). (c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate and of facility fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest relating to utilization fees, or based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Agent, and all computations of interest pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof shall be made by a Lender, on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but 52
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent (or, in the case of Section 2.07 hereof, by a Lender) of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility or utilization fee, as the case may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. (e) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lender or Lenders hereunder that the Borrower or such Subsidiary Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to such Lender or Lenders on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender or Lenders. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. SECTION 4.02 Taxes/Borrowings. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower and each Subsidiary Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender Party and the Agent, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on such Lender Party or the Agent, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender Party or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender Party, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on such Lender Party, by the jurisdiction of such Lender Party's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower shall be required by applicable Requirements of Law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender Party or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.02) such Lender Party or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower and such Subsidiary Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower or respective Subsidiary Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law and (iv) as soon as practicable after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Borrower or respective Subsidiary Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Schedule I-B, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment 53
thereof, to the extent such a receipt is issued therefore, or other evidence of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performance under or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Letters of Credit (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). (c) The Borrower or the respective Subsidiary Borrower will indemnify each of the Lender Parties and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 4.02) imposed on or paid by such Lender Party or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. A reimbursement shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender Party or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. The Agent and each Lender Party, as the case may be, shall give prompt (within 10 Business Days) notice to the Borrower of the payment by the Agent or such Lender Party, as the case may be, of such amounts payable by the Borrower under the indemnity set forth in this subsection (c), and of the assertion by any governmental or taxing authority that such amounts are due and payable, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect the Borrower's or any Subsidiary Borrower's obligations hereunder to reimburse the Agent and each Lender Party for such Taxes or Other Taxes or taxes imposed or asserted on amounts payable under this Section 4.02, except that neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary Borrower shall be liable for penalties or interest accrued or incurred after such 10 Business Day period until such time as it receives the notice contemplated above, after which time it shall be liable for interest and penalties accrued or incurred prior to or during such 10 Business Day period and accrued or incurred after such receipt. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary Borrower shall be liable for any penalties, interest, expense or other liability with respect to such Taxes or Other Taxes after it has reimbursed the amount thereof to the Agent or the appropriate Lender Party. (d) Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each initial Lender Party and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender Party, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower with Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender Party is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest payable by the Borrower or certifying that the interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Similarly, with respect to each Subsidiary Borrower organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States, each Lender Party, on or 54
prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each initial Lender Party and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender Party, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower or such Subsidiary Borrower (but only so long as such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower or such Subsidiary Borrower with appropriate documentation certifying applicable exemptions from withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction on payments of interest payable by such Subsidiary Borrower. If the forms provided by a Lender Party at the time such Lender Party first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a withholding tax (including, without limitation, United States interest withholding tax) rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from "Taxes" unless and until such Lender Party provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such forms; provided however, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender Party becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender Party assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of this Section 4.02 in respect of withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includible in Taxes) withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender Party assignee on such date. (e) For any period with respect to which a Lender Party has failed to provide the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower with the appropriate form described in Section 4.02(d) hereof (other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form otherwise is not required under the first two sentences of subsection (d) above), such Lender Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 4.02(a) hereof with respect to Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the United States); provided, however, that should a Lender Party become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender Party shall reasonably request to assist the Lender Party to recover such Taxes. (f) Without affecting its rights under this Section 4.02 or any provision of this Agreement, each Lender Party agrees that if any Taxes or Other Taxes are imposed and required by law to be paid or to be withheld from any amount payable to any Lender Party or its Applicable Lending Office with respect to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower would be obligated pursuant to this Section 4.02 to increase any amounts payable to such Lender Party or to pay any such Taxes or Other Taxes, such Lender Party shall use reasonable efforts to select an alternative Applicable Lending Office which would not result in the imposition of such Taxes or Other Taxes; provided, however, that no Lender Party shall be obligated to select an alternative Applicable Lending Office if such Lender Party determines that (i) as a result of such selection such Lender Party would be in violation of an applicable law, regulation, or treaty, or would incur unreasonable additional costs or expenses or (ii) such selection would be inadvisable for regulatory reasons or inconsistent with the interests of such Lender Party. 55
(g) In the event that an additional payment is made under this Section 4.02 for the account of any Lender Party and such Lender Party, in its sole discretion, determines that it has finally and irrevocably received or been granted a credit against or release or remission for, or repayment of, any tax paid or payable by it in respect of or calculated with reference to the deduction or withholding giving rise to such payment, such Lender Party shall, to the extent that it determines that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to the Borrower or Subsidiary Borrower, as the case may be, such amount as such Lender Party shall, in its sole discretion, have determined to be attributable to such deduction or withholding and which will leave such Lender Party (after such payment) in no worse position than it would have been in if the Borrower or Subsidiary Borrower had not been required to make such deduction or withholding. Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of a Lender Party to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige any Lender Party to claim any tax credit or to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or require any Lender Party to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled. (h) Each Lender Party agrees with the Borrower that it will take all reasonable actions by all usual means (i) to secure and maintain the benefit of all benefits available to it under the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty concluded by the United States of America to which it may be entitled by reason of the location of such Lender Party's Applicable Lending Office or place of incorporation or its status as an enterprise of any jurisdiction having any such applicable double tax treaty, if such benefit would reduce the amount payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower in accordance with this Section 4.02 and (ii) otherwise to cooperate with the Borrower to minimize the amount payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to this Section 4.02; provided, however, that no Lender Party shall be obliged to disclose to the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower any information regarding its tax affairs or tax computations nor to reorder its tax affairs or tax planning pursuant thereto. (i) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Borrowers contained in this Section 4.02 shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations. SECTION 4.03 Sharing of Payments, Etc./Borrowings. If any Lender Party shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.11 or 4.02 hereof) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lender Parties, such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the other Lender Parties such participations in the Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender Party to share the excess payment ratably with each of them, provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such purchase from each Lender Party shall be rescinded and such Lender Party shall repay to the purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender Party's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the 56
amount of such Lender Party's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender Party so purchasing a participation from another Lender Party pursuant to this Section 4.03 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender Party were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. SECTION 4.04 Evidence of Debt/Borrowings. (a) Each Lender Party shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender Party resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender Party from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender Party from time to time hereunder. (b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 10.07(c) hereof shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender Party, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender Party hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender Party's share thereof. (c) The entries made in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. SECTION 4.05 Payments and Computations/Letters of Credit. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.06 hereof, the Borrower and each LC Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall make each payment with respect to the Letters of Credit, the Issuing Banks or the Lenders to be made by it free and clear of all claims, charges, offsets or deductions whatsoever not later than (i) if such payment relates to letter of credit facility fees or amounts (other than reimbursements for payments in an Alternative Currency made under Letters of Credit) or if such payment relates to a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars, 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the respective Issuing Bank at its address referred to in Section 10.02 hereof in same day funds and (ii) if such payment relates to reimbursement of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, (A) in such Alternative Currency, at the respective Issuing Bank's Payment Office therefor so long as such payment is made by the close of business on the Business Day when due and (B) thereafter in Dollars (at the then Dollar equivalent of the amount due on such preceding Business Day), by 12:00 noon (New York City time) to the respective Issuing Bank at its address referred to in Section 10.02 hereof in same day funds as provided in Section 3.14 above. The respective Issuing Bank will promptly thereafter (if amounts are owed to the Lenders by the terms hereof) cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of reimbursement obligations or letter of credit facility fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.04(a), 3.08, or 4.06 hereof) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to such Issuing Bank or to such Lender to be distributed to the 57
appropriate Lender or Lenders and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the Agent's acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 10.07(d) hereof, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the respective Issuing Bank shall make all payments hereunder in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. (b) The Borrower and each LC Subsidiary hereby authorize each Lender and the Issuing Banks, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank (including the immediate repayments of participations purchased and funded by a Lender pursuant to Section 3.05 hereof) is not paid when due hereunder to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower's or such LC Subsidiary's accounts with such Lender or such Issuing Bank any amount so due (it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to the contrary, accounts, deposits, sums, securities or other property of any Foreign Subsidiary or of any Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary (including any Foreign Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Borrower or LC Subsidiary) will not serve at any time, directly or indirectly, to collateralize or otherwise offset the Obligations of the Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary, and, in addition, unless otherwise agreed to by the Borrower, the accounts, deposits, sums, securities or other property of a Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary will only serve to collateralize or offset the Obligations of another Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Borrower or LC Subsidiary if such former Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary is owned by such latter Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Borrower or LC Subsidiary). (c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate and of letter of credit facility fees shall be made by the respective Issuing Bank on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Federal Funds Rate and of Letter of Credit fees shall be made by the respective Issuing Bank on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or letter of credit facility fees are payable. Each determination by an Issuing Bank of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (d) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or letter of credit facility fee, as the case may be. (e) Unless the respective Issuing Bank shall have received notice from the Borrower or an LC Subsidiary prior to the date on which any payment is due to such Issuing Bank or Lenders hereunder that the Borrower or such LC Subsidiary will not make such payment in full, such Issuing Bank may assume that the Borrower or such LC Subsidiary has made such payment in full to such Issuing Bank on such date and such 58
Issuing Bank may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to such Lender or Lenders on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender or Lenders. If and to the extent that the Borrower or such LC Subsidiary shall not have so made such payment in full to such Issuing Bank, each such Lender shall repay to such Issuing Bank forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to such Issuing Bank, at the Federal Funds Rate. SECTION 4.06 Taxes/Letters of Credit. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower and each LC Subsidiary hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future Taxes. If the Borrower or any LC Subsidiary shall be required by applicable Requirements of Law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Lender or Issuing Bank, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.06) such Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower and such LC Subsidiary shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower or respective LC Subsidiary shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law and (iv) as soon as practicable after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Borrower or respective LC Subsidiary shall furnish to the Issuing Bank, at its address referred to in Schedule I-B, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, to the extent such a receipt is issued therefore, or other evidence of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Bank. (b) The Borrower or the respective LC Subsidiary will indemnify each of the Lenders and any Issuing Bank for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 4.06) imposed on or paid by such Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. A reimbursement shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. Any Issuing Bank and each Lender, as the case may be, shall give prompt (within 10 Business Days) notice to the Borrower of the payment by such Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, of such amounts payable by the Borrower under the indemnity set forth in this subsection (c), and of the assertion by any governmental or taxing authority that such amounts are due and payable, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect the Borrower's or any LC Subsidiary's obligations hereunder to reimburse each Issuing Bank and each Lender for such Taxes or Other Taxes or taxes imposed or asserted on amounts payable under this Section 4.06, except that neither the Borrower nor any LC Subsidiary shall be liable for penalties or interest accrued or incurred after such 10 Business Day period until such time as it receives the notice contemplated above, after which time it shall be liable for interest and penalties accrued or incurred prior to or during such 10 Business Day period and accrued or incurred after such receipt. Neither the Borrower nor any LC Subsidiary shall be liable 59
for any penalties, interest, expense or other liability with respect to such Taxes or Other Taxes after it has reimbursed the amount thereof to an Issuing Bank or the appropriate Lender. (c) Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each initial Lender party and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender Party, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower with Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender Party is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest payable by the Borrower or certifying that the interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Similarly, with respect to each LC Subsidiary organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, each Lender Party, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each initial Lender Party and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender Party, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower or such LC Subsidiary (but only so long as such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower or such LC Subsidiary with appropriate documentation certifying applicable exemptions from withholding tax imposed by any jurisdiction on payments of interest payable by such LC Subsidiary. If the forms provided by a Lender Party at the time such Lender Party first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a withholding tax (including, without limitation, United States interest withholding) tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from "Taxes" unless and until such Lender Party provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such forms; provided, however, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender Party becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender Party assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of this Section 4.06 in respect of withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includible in Taxes) withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender Party assignee on such date. (d) For any period with respect to which a Lender Party has failed to provide the Borrower or any LC Subsidiary with the appropriate form described in Section 4.06(c) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form otherwise is not required under the first two sentences of subsection (c) above), such Lender Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 4.06(a) hereof with respect to Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the United States); provided, however, that should a Lender Party become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as 60
the Lender Party shall reasonably request to assist the Lender Party to recover such Taxes. (e) Without affecting its rights under this Section 4.06 or any provision of this Agreement, each Lender Party agrees that if any Taxes or Other Taxes are imposed and required by law to be paid or to be withheld from any amount payable to any Lender Party or its Applicable Lending Office with respect to which the Borrower or any LC Subsidiary would be obligated pursuant to this Section 4.06 to increase any amounts payable to such Lender Party or to pay any such Taxes or Other Taxes, such Lender Party shall use reasonable efforts to select an alternative Applicable Lending Office which would not result in the imposition of such Taxes or Other Taxes; provided, however, that no Lender Party shall be obligated to select an alternative Applicable Lending Office if such Lender Party determines that (i) as a result of such selection such Lender Party would be in violation of an applicable law, regulation, or treaty, or would incur unreasonable additional costs or expenses or (ii) such selection would be inadvisable for regulatory reasons or inconsistent with the interests of such Lender Party. (f) In the event that an additional payment is made under this Section 4.06 for the account of any Lender Party and such Lender Party, in its sole discretion, determines that it has finally and irrevocably received or been granted a credit against or release or remission for, or repayment of, any tax paid or payable by it in respect of or calculated with reference to the deduction or withholding giving rise to such payment, such Lender Party shall, to the extent that it determines that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to the Borrower or LC Subsidiary, as the case may be, such amount as such Lender Party shall, in its sole discretion, have determined to be attributable to such deduction or withholding and which will leave such Lender Party (after such payment) in no worse position than it would have been in if the Borrower or LC Subsidiary had not been required to make such deduction or withholding. Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of a Lender Party to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige any Lender Party to claim any tax credit or to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or require any Lender Party to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled. (g) Each Lender Party agrees with the Borrower that it will take all reasonable actions by all usual means (i) to secure and maintain the benefit of all benefits available to it under the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty concluded by the United States of America to which it may be entitled by reason of the location of such Lender Party's Applicable Lending Office or place of incorporation or its status as an enterprise of any jurisdiction having any such applicable double tax treaty, if such benefit would reduce the amount payable by the Borrower or any LC Subsidiary in accordance with this Section 4.06 and (ii) otherwise to cooperate with the Borrower to minimize the amount payable by the Borrower or any LC Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 4.06; provided, however, that no Lender Party shall be obliged to disclose to the Borrower or any LC Subsidiary any information regarding its tax affairs or tax computations nor to reorder its tax affairs or tax planning pursuant hereto. 61
(h) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower or any LC Subsidiary hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower and the LC Subsidiaries contained in this Section 4.06 shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations. SECTION 4.07 Sharing of Payments, Etc./Letters of Credit. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of any Letter of Credit Liability of the Borrower or any LC Subsidiary hereunder (other than pursuant to Section 3.08 or 4.06 hereof) in excess of its Commitment Percentage of any such payments on account of such Letter of Credit Liability obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in such other Lenders' participations purchased pursuant to Section 3.05 hereof as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each other Lender, provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender such purchase from each other Lender shall be rescinded and each such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to each such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower and each LC Subsidiary agree that any Lender so purchasing a sub-participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 4.07 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such sub-participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower or each LC Subsidiary in the amount of such participation.

(f) Since February 1, 2003, there has been no Material Adverse Change. (g) There is no pending or, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, threatened action or proceeding affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator, (i) which has a reasonable probability (taking into account the exhaustion of all appeals and the assertion of all defenses) of having a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any Loan Document. (h) The Borrower is not engaged in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock, and no proceeds of any Advance or drawing under any Letter of Credit will be used to purchase any Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock.

(m) Except as provided in Schedule X, neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has been notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or has been terminated, within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA and no Multiemployer Plan is reasonably expected to be in reorganization or to be terminated, within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA. (n) Each of Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Requirements of Law applicable to their properties, assets and business where the failure to so comply would (as to all such failures to comply in the aggregate) have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of any Loan Party, threatened in writing, to terminate or modify any license, permit or other approval issued by a Governmental Authority, the termination or modification of which (in the aggregate as to all such matters) would have a Material Adverse Effect. (o) The Borrower is, individually and together with its Subsidiaries, Solvent.

the extent owned by the Borrower or one or more of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens, except those created under the Collateral Documents or Permitted Liens.

(b) Preservation of Existence, Etc. Preserve and maintain, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to preserve and maintain, its existence (corporate or otherwise), rights (charter and statutory), and franchises except if, in the reasonable business judgment of the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, it is in its best economic interest not to preserve and maintain such rights or franchises and such failure to preserve and maintain such rights or franchises would not materially adversely affect the rights of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder or the ability of any Loan Party to perform its obligations under the respective Loan Documents (it being understood that the foregoing 68
shall not prohibit, or be violated as a result of, any transactions by or involving any Loan Party or other Subsidiary otherwise permitted under Section 7.02 below). (c) Visitation Rights.

ARTICLE IX THE AGENT SECTION 9.01 Authorization and Action. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Advances), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining 86
from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and any other Loan Document unless the distribution of such notice is otherwise provided for herein or therein.

accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any such Subsidiary, all as if CUSA were not the Agent or Citibank were not an Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. SECTION 9.04 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 6.01 hereof and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.

Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs expenses or disbursements, this Section 9.05(a) applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Agent, an Issuing Bank, any Lender or a third party.

judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse such Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by such Issuing Bank in connection with the preparation, execution, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or the Letters of Credit Issued by it, to the extent that the Issuing Bank is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs expenses or disbursements, this Section 9.05(b) applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Issuing Bank, the Agent, any Lender or a third party.

Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders, after consulting with the Borrower and giving due consideration to any successor agent recommended by the Borrower, shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent with the consent of the Borrower (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and consented to by the Borrower, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, after consulting with the Borrower and giving due consideration to any successor agent recommended by the Borrower, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed to do business under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000.

advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims (other than lost profits), damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel), which may be incurred by or asserted against any Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any investigation, litigation, or proceeding (whether or not such Indemnified Party is party thereto) related to any acquisition or proposed acquisition by the Borrower, or by any Subsidiary of the Borrower, of all or any portion of the stock or substantially all the assets of any Person or any use or proposed use of the Advances or Letters of Credit by any Loan Party, except to the extent such claim, damage, liability or expense shall have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the event this indemnity is unenforceable as a matter of law as to a particular matter or consequence referred to herein, it shall be enforceable to the full extent permitted by law. The indemnification provisions set forth above shall be in addition to any liability the Borrower may otherwise have. Without prejudice to the survival of any other obligation of the Borrower hereunder, the indemnities and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 10.04 shall survive the payment in full of all the Obligations. (d) The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the funding method by each Lender of its Advances hereunder shall be in the sole discretion of such Lender. The Borrower agrees that for purposes of any determination to be made under Sections 2.07, 2.11(a), 2.12 or 10.04(b) hereof each Lender shall be deemed to have funded its Eurodollar Rate Advances with proceeds of Dollar deposits in the London interbank market. SECTION 10.05 Right of Set-off. Upon (i) the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the granting of the consent specified by Section 8.01 hereof to authorize the Agent to declare the Advances due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.01 hereof or to demand payment of (or cash collateralization of) all then outstanding Letter of Credit Liability, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of the Loan Parties now or hereafter existing under this Agreement to such Lender (including, to the fullest extent permitted by law, obligations indirectly owed to such Lender by virtue of its purchase of a participation or sub-participation of the Letter of Credit Liability pursuant to Section 3.05 hereof), whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured (it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to the contrary, accounts, deposits, sums, securities or other property of any Foreign Subsidiary or of any Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary (including any Foreign Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Borrower or LC Subsidiary) will not serve at any time, directly or indirectly, to collateralize or otherwise offset the Obligations of the Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary, and, in addition, unless otherwise agreed to by the Borrower, the accounts, deposits, sums, securities or other property of a Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary will only serve to collateralize or offset the Obligations of another Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Borrower or LC Subsidiary if such 93
former Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary is owned by such latter Foreign Subsidiary or Subsidiary of a Foreign Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Borrower or LC Subsidiary). Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender or any of its Affiliates, provided, that, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section 10.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Lender and its Affiliates may have. SECTION 10.06 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower, each LC Subsidiary and each Subsidiary Borrower to be a party hereto on the date hereof, each Issuing Bank to be a party hereto on the date hereof, and the Agent and when the Agent shall have been notified by each Lender that such Lender has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each LC Subsidiary, each Subsidiary Borrower, each Issuing Bank, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower, each LC Subsidiary and each Subsidiary Borrower shall not have the right to assign its respective rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders. SECTION 10.07 Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may, and if demanded by the Borrower (following a demand by such Lender pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.11, 3.08, 4.02 or 4.06 hereof, upon at least 10 days' notice to such Lender and the Agent) will, assign to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion, respectively, of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it, its Issuing Commitment and participations in Letter of Credit Liability and Swing Line Advances); provided, however, that (i) each such respective assignment shall be of a percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the assigning Lender's Commitment, Advances, its Issuing Commitment and participations in Letter of Credit Liability and Swing Line Advances, that is constant and not varying over time, (ii) the respective amounts of the rights and obligations under the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such partial assignment) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 (or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof), (iii) except during the continuance of a Default, each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee consented to by the Borrower (following reasonable advance written notice to the Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided, that, the Borrower's consent need not be obtained if such assignment is made to another Lender or to an Affiliate of the assigning Lender, provided that any Lender so assigning to any of its Affiliates shall give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and the Agent, (iv) each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 10.07(a) shall be arranged by the Borrower (at its expense, including, without limitation, payment of the processing and recordation fee referred to in subclause (vi) hereof) after consultation with the Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments which together cover all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement, (v) no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 10.07(a) unless and until such Lender shall have received one 94
or more payments from either the Borrower or one or more Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement, (vi) each such assignment shall be consented to by each Issuing Bank and the Agent (which consent of the Agent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (vii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; provided, that, no such fee shall be payable in connection with an assignment by an assigning Lender to an Affiliate of such assigning Lender. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto). (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Borrower, any LC Subsidiary, any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Loan Party or the performance or observance by the Borrower, any LC Subsidiary, any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Loan Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 6.01 hereof and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any Issuing Bank, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent or the respective Issuing Bank to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent or such Issuing Bank by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as Lender. 95
(c) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.02 hereof a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time and the names and addresses and the Issuing Commitments of each Issuing Bank from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and the Issuing Banks. (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment and the Advances owing to it; provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the owner of any Advance for all purposes of this Agreement, and (iv) the Borrower, the Issuing Banks, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, provided, further, that, to the extent of any such participation (unless otherwise stated therein and subject to the preceding proviso), the purchaser of such participation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have the same rights and benefits hereunder as it would have if it were Lender hereunder; and provided, further, that each such participation shall be granted pursuant to an agreement providing that the purchaser thereof shall not have the right to consent or object to any action by the selling Lender (who shall retain such right) other than an action which would (i) reduce principal of or interest on any Advance, any amount due hereunder with respect to the Letters of Credit or other amounts or fees in which such purchaser has an interest, (ii) postpone any date fixed for payment of principal of or interest on any such Advance, such amounts due with respect to Letters of Credit or other amounts or such fees, (iii) extend the Termination Date or (iv) release all or substantially all the Collateral, all or substantially all the Guarantors or the Borrower as a guarantor under Section 2.13 or Section 3.13 hereof. (f) Upon written request of the Borrower to a Lender, such Lender shall, to the extent consistent with the policies of such Lender, inform the Borrower of the Dollar amount of any Full Term Participation (as hereinafter defined) that such Lender has entered into; provided, however, that no Lender shall be obligated to disclose such information if the disclosure thereof would constitute a violation of law or regulation or 96
violate any confidentiality agreement to which such Lender is subject. For the purposes of this subsection (f), "Full Term Participation" means a participation by a Lender to another Person whereby such other Person has purchased (pursuant to a participation agreement) all or a portion of such Lender's Commitment from the effective date of such participation agreement to the Termination Date. (g) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, each Lender may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates without the consent of the Borrower or the Agent, provided that any Lender so assigning to any of its Affiliates shall give prior notice thereof to the Borrower and the Agent; and each Lender or any of its Affiliates may assign any of its rights (including, without limitation, rights to payment of principal and/or interest hereunder) under this Agreement to any Federal Reserve Bank without notice to or consent of the Borrower or the Agent. (h) If any Lender requests any payment from the Borrower under Section 2.07, 2.11, 3.08, 4.02 or 4.06 hereof, then, subject to Section 10.07(a) hereof and provided no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower may request such Lender to (and, upon such request, such Lender, without any obligation to pay any fees in respect thereof, shall) assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees acceptable to the Agent in accordance with Section 10.07(a) hereof provided that at the time of any such assignment the Borrower has paid to the Lender all amounts due it hereunder. SECTION 10.08 Severability of Provisions. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 10.09 Independence of Provisions. All agreements and covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect such that if a particular action or condition is prohibited by the terms of any such agreement or covenant, the fact that such action or condition would be permitted within the limitations of another agreement or covenant shall not be construed as allowing such action to be taken or condition to exist. SECTION 10.10 Confidentiality. Each Lender, each Issuing Bank and the Agent (for purposes of this Section 10.10, each a "Recipient") agrees that it will not disclose to any third party any Confidential Information provided to it by the Borrower; provided, that, the foregoing will not (i) restrict the ability of the Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders and any loan participants from freely exchanging Confidential Information among themselves (and their respective Affiliates, employees, attorneys, agents and advisors), (ii) restrict the ability to disclose Confidential Information to a prospective Eligible Assignee or participant, provided, that, such Eligible Assignee or participant executes a confidentiality agreement with the selling Lender agreeing to be bound by the terms hereof prior to disclosure of Confidential Information to such Eligible Assignee or participant or (iii) prohibit the disclosure of Confidential Information to the extent: (a) the Confidential Information is or has already become part of the public domain at the time of disclosure, by publication or otherwise, except by breach of this 97
Section 10.10, (b) the Confidential Information can be established by written evidence to have already been in the lawful possession of the Recipient prior to the time of disclosure; or (c) the Confidential Information is received by the Recipient from a third party not known to have a similar restriction and without breach of this Section 10.10, or (d) the Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or governmental body, or by subpoena, summons or other legal process, or by law, rule or regulation, or by applicable regulatory or professional standards provided that prior to such disclosure the Borrower and the non-disclosing party are each given reasonable advance notice of such order and an opportunity to object to such disclosure; provided, that, no such notice or opportunity shall be required if disclosure is required in connection with an examination by a regulatory authority or is required in such circumstances where the applicable Governmental Authority does not permit such notice or opportunity (it being understood the Recipient will inform such authority of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information being disclosed). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Loan Party and each Recipient, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, attorneys and other advisors, agents and representatives, may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, any information with respect to the United States tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the respective Loan Party or Recipient, as the case may be, relating to such United States tax treatment and tax structure, provided, that, the foregoing shall not apply to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with applicable securities laws. SECTION 10.11 Headings. Article and Section headings in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose. SECTION 10.12 Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter and, except for the letter agreements referred to in Sections 2.03(c) and 3.06(b) hereof, supersedes all previous understandings, written or oral, in respect thereof. SECTION 10.13 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. SECTION 10.14 Consent to Jurisdiction. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal court sitting in the County of New York, The City of New York, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or such Federal court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably agrees, to the fullest extent each may effectively do so, that each will not assert any defense that such courts do not have subject matter or personal jurisdiction of such action or proceeding or over any party hereto. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other process which may be served in any such action or proceeding by 98
certified mail, return receipt requested, or by delivering of a copy of such process to such party at its address specified in Section 10.02 hereof or by any other method permitted by law. Each of the parties hereby agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or by any other manner provided by law. (b) Nothing in this Section 10.14 shall affect the right of any of the parties hereto to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of any of the parties to bring any action or proceeding against any of the parties or their property in the courts of other jurisdictions. SECTION 10.15 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, EXCEPT, IN THE CASE OF ARTICLE III, TO THE EXTENT SUCH LAWS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE UCP. SECTION 10.16 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE LC SUBSIDIARIES, THE SUBSIDIARY BORROWERS, THE AGENT, THE LENDERS AND EACH ISSUING BANK HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ADVANCES OR THE LETTERS OF CREDIT, OR THE ACTIONS OF THE AGENT, ANY LENDER OR THE ISSUING BANK IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

EXHIBIT D SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY dated as of June __, 2003 made by the Persons listed on the signature pages hereof and the Additional Guarantors (as defined in Section 8(b) hereof) (such Persons so listed and the Additional Guarantors being, collectively, the "Guarantors" and, individually, each a "Guarantor") in favor of the Lender Parties (as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below). PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS. (1) The Gap, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), is party to a Credit Agreement dated as of June __, 2003 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"; the capitalized terms defined therein being used herein as therein defined) with certain Subsidiaries of the Borrower, certain Lender Parties party thereto, certain other financial institutions and Citicorp USA, Inc. as Agent for such Lender Parties. Each Guarantor will derive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. (2) It is a condition precedent to the making of Advances and the issuance of Letters of Credit by the Lender Parties under the Credit Agreement that each Guarantor shall have executed and delivered this Guaranty. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and in order to induce the Lender Parties to make Advances and to issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, hereby agrees as follows: Section 1. Guaranty; Limitation of Liability. (a) Each Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a required prepayment or by acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrower, each Subsidiary Borrower and each LC Subsidiary now or hereafter existing under or in respect of the Credit Agreement, of all Obligations of the Borrower and the Hedge Subsidiaries now or hereafter existing under the Hedge Agreements, and of all Obligations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries now or hereafter existing under Operating Indebtedness Agreements (including, without limitation, any extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments or renewals of any or all of the foregoing Obligations), whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise, (such Obligations being the "Guaranteed Obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all reasonable and documented expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable and documented fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel) incurred by the Agent, any other Lender Party, or any Hedge Bank in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed to any Lender Party under or in respect of the Credit Agreement or to any Hedge Bank under or in respect of a Hedge Agreement or to any Operating Lender under or in respect of an Operating Indebtedness Agreement but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such other Loan Party.
2 (b) Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of this Guaranty, the Agent and each other Lender Party, hereby confirm that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Guaranty and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law (as hereinafter defined), the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Agent, the other Lender Parties, any Hedge Bank and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty at any time and all of the other liabilities of each of the Guarantors under this Guaranty shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all of the other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such requirements of law, and after giving effect to any collections from, any rights to receive contributions from, or any payments made by or on behalf of, any of the other Guarantors in respect of the Obligations of such other Guarantor under this Guaranty, result in the Obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance. For purposes hereof, "Bankruptcy Law" means any proceeding of the type referred to in Section 8.01(e) of the Credit Agreement or Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar foreign, federal or state law for the relief of debtors. (c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to any Lender Party, or Hedge Bank or Operating Lender under this Guaranty or any other guaranty, such Guarantor will contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such amounts to each other Guarantor and each other guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the Lender Parties under or in respect of the Credit Agreement, the Hedge Bank under or in respect of the respective Hedge Agreement, or the Operating Lender under or in respect of the respective Operating Indebtedness Agreement. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein and, with respect to the Guarantors on the one hand, and the Lender Parties and the Hedge Banks on the other, the Intercreditor Agreement, it is understood and agreed by the parties hereto and by any Hedge Bank seeking to enforce this Guaranty or to otherwise obtain any benefit under this Guaranty or any Operating Lender seeking to enforce this Guaranty or otherwise obtain any benefit under this Guaranty that (i) any such Hedge Bank or Operating Lender shall be bound by all of the provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder in favor of the Lender Parties with respect to the Credit Agreement, and the Guaranteed Obligations in favor of the Operating Lenders with respect to the Operating Indebtedness Agreements and the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder in favor of the Hedge Banks with respect to the Hedge Agreements entered into by the Hedge Subsidiaries are separate, (iii) no Lender Party or Operating Lender shall have any claim under this Guaranty or under any other Loan Document or any Operating Indebtedness Agreement solely as a result of a claim by any Hedge Bank under this Guaranty, and no Hedge Bank shall have any claim under this Guaranty solely as a result of a claim by any Lender Party or Operating Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any Operating Indebtedness Agreement or by any other Hedge Bank under this Guaranty, (iv) with respect to Guaranteed Obligations under Hedge
3 Agreements entered into by Hedge Subsidiaries, this Guaranty shall operate in favor of only those Lenders or Affiliates of a Lender which are Hedge Banks prior to the termination of this Guaranty, and then only with respect to the Obligations incurred under Hedge Agreements with Hedge Banks in effect prior to such termination, and (v) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations under Operating Indebtedness Agreements, this Guaranty shall operate in favor of only those Lenders or Affiliates of Lenders which are Operating Lenders prior to the termination of this Guaranty, and then only with respect to the Obligations incurred under Operating Indebtedness Agreements in effect prior to such termination. Section 2. Guaranty Absolute.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS. (1) The Borrower has entered into a Credit Agreement dated as of June __, 2003 with the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agent (each as defined therein) and other financial institutions (said agreement, as it may hereafter be amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, being the "Credit Agreement"). (2) The Grantors (other than the Borrower) have guaranteed the Obligations of the Borrower and certain of its Subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement and the Obligations of the Borrower and the Hedge Subsidiaries (as defined in the Credit Agreement) under the Secured Hedge Agreements (as hereinafter defined) pursuant to a Guaranty dated as of June __, 2003, by each such Grantor (and certain other Persons party thereto as Guarantor). (3) Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Grantors are entering into this Agreement in order to grant to the Collateral Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties a security interest in the Collateral (as hereinafter defined). (4) The Borrower and/or the Hedge Subsidiaries have entered into certain Hedge Agreements including, without limitation, those set forth on Schedule I hereto and the Borrower and the Hedge Subsidiaries may from time to time hereafter enter into Hedge Agreements permitted under the Credit Agreement, in each case, with any Lender party to the Credit Agreement (or an affiliate thereof) (collectively, "Secured Hedge Agreements"), such Lenders or such affiliate that are and hereafter become counterparty to a Secured Hedge Agreement being the "Hedge Banks". (5) One or more Operating Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) have extended or hereafter may from time to time extend Operating Indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to the Borrower or one or more of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Operating Indebtedness Agreements (as defined in the Credit Agreement). (6) Each Grantor is the owner of the shares of stock or other equity interests set forth opposite such Grantor's name on and as otherwise described in Schedule III hereto and issued by the Persons named therein (the "Initial Pledged Equity"). (7) The Secured Parties have agreed that their respective rights to the Collateral are to be governed by an Intercreditor and Collateral Agency Agreement dated as of the date of this Agreement (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the
"Intercreditor Agreement"), among the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Banks and the Hedge Banks. (8) For purposes of Sections 3.12(c) and 3.15 of the Credit Agreement, as provided in Section 5(a) hereof, the Borrower will open a letter of credit collateral deposit account (the "L/C Collateral Account"), with the Collateral Agent, in the name of the Collateral Agent and under the sole control and dominion of the Collateral Agent and subject to the terms of this Agreement.

(11) Terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined in this Agreement are used in this Agreement as defined in the Credit Agreement.

SECTION 2. Security for Obligations. (a) This Agreement secures, in the case of each Grantor, the payment of all Obligations of such Grantor now or hereafter existing under the Loan Documents, the payment of all Obligations of the Borrower or the Hedge Subsidiaries now or hereafter existing under the Secured Hedge Agreements and the payment of all Obligations of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries under Operating Indebtedness Agreements, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for principal, reimbursement obligations, interest, fees, premiums, penalties, indemnifications, contract causes of action, costs, 3
expenses or otherwise (all such Obligations being the "Secured Obligations"). (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and with respect to the Grantors on the one hand, and the Lender Parties, the Operating Lenders and the Hedge Banks on the other, or in the Intercreditor Agreement, it is understood and agreed by the parties hereto and by any Hedge Bank or Operating Lender seeking to enforce this Agreement or to otherwise obtain any benefit under this Agreement that (i) any such Hedge Bank or Operating Lender shall be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Secured Obligations hereunder in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Lender Parties, the Secured Obligations in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Operating Lenders and the Secured Obligations hereunder in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Hedge Banks are separate, (iii) no claim shall be made hereunder by the Collateral Agent on behalf of any Lender Party against any of the Collateral solely as a result of a claim hereunder by the Collateral Agent on behalf of any Hedge Bank or any Operating Lender, and no claim shall be made hereunder by the Collateral Agent on behalf of any Hedge Bank or any Operating Lender against any of the Collateral solely as a result of a claim hereunder by the Collateral Agent on behalf of any Lender Party, any other Operating Lender or any other Hedge Bank, (iv) with respect to the Secured Obligations incurred in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Hedge Banks, this Agreement shall operate in favor of only those Secured Obligations with respect to Lenders or Affiliates of a Lender which are Hedge Banks prior to the termination of this Agreement with respect to the Loan Parties, and then only with respect to such Secured Obligations incurred under Secured Hedge Agreements in effect prior to such termination and (v) with respect to the Secured Obligations incurred in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Operating Lenders, this Agreement shall operate in favor of only those Secured Obligations with respect to Lenders or Affiliates of a Lender which are Operating Lenders prior to the termination of this Agreement with respect to the Loan Parties, and then only with respect to such Secured Obligations incurred under Operating Indebtedness Agreements in effect prior to such termination. SECTION 3. Grantors Remain Liable. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) each Grantor shall remain liable under the contracts and agreements included in such Grantor's Collateral to the extent set forth therein to perform all of its duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (b) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of any of the rights hereunder shall not release any Grantor from any of its duties or obligations under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral and (c) no Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor shall any Secured Party be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of any Grantor thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder. SECTION 4. Delivery and Control of Security Collateral. So long as any Advance or any other Obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall remain unpaid, any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding, any Secured Hedge Agreement or Operating Indebtedness Agreement shall be in effect or any Lender Party shall have any Commitment: 4
(a) All certificates or instruments representing or evidencing Security Collateral shall be delivered to and held by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent pursuant hereto and shall be in suitable form for transfer by delivery, or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent shall have the right at any time, if it believes such is reasonably necessary or proper to better preserve and protect its rights hereunder, and with notice to the respective Grantor, to transfer to or to register in the name of the Collateral Agent or any of its nominees any or all of the Security Collateral, subject only to the revocable rights specified in Section 11(a) hereof. In addition, the Collateral Agent shall have the right at any time to exchange certificates or instruments representing or evidencing Security Collateral for certificates or instruments of smaller or larger denominations. (b) With respect to any Security Collateral in which any Grantor has any right, title or interest and that constitutes an uncertificated security, such Grantor, at the request from time to time of the Collateral Agent, will cause the issuer thereof either (i) to register the Collateral Agent as the registered owner of such security or (ii) to agree in an authenticated record with such Grantor and the Collateral Agent that such issuer will comply with instructions with respect to such security originated by the Collateral Agent without further consent of such Grantor, such authenticated record to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. (c) With respect to any Security Collateral in which any Grantor has any right, title or interest and that constitutes a security entitlement in which the Collateral Agent is not the entitlement holder, such Grantor will cause the securities intermediary with respect to such security entitlement either (i) to identify in its records the Collateral Agent as the entitlement holder of such security entitlement against such securities intermediary or (ii) to agree in an authenticated record with such Grantor and the Collateral Agent that such securities intermediary will comply with entitlement orders (that is, notifications communicated to such securities intermediary directing transfer or redemption of the financial asset to which such Grantor has a security entitlement) originated by the Collateral Agent without further consent of such Grantor, such authenticated record to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent. (d) No Grantor will change or add any securities intermediary that maintains any securities account in which any of the Security Collateral is credited or carried, or change or add any such securities account, in each case without first complying with the above provisions of this Section 4 in order to perfect the security interest granted hereunder in such Security Collateral. SECTION 5. Maintaining the Account Collateral. So long as any Advance or any other Obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall remain unpaid, any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding, any Secured Hedge Agreement or Operating Indebtedness Agreement shall be in effect or any Lender Party shall have any Commitment: (a) No later than 30 days of the date hereof, the Borrower shall take all necessary actions to establish the L/C Collateral Account and thereafter the Borrower will 5
at all times maintain the L/C Collateral Account only with the Collateral Agent. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent shall have sole right to direct the disposition of funds with respect to the L/C Collateral Account as provided in Section 16 hereof. Prior to the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, funds held in the L/C Collateral Account, (including, without limitation, interest on Cash Equivalents credited thereto) will be paid or released to or for the account of, or withdrawn by or for the account of, the Borrower or any other Person from the L/C Collateral Account, in accordance with Sections 3.12(c) and 3.15 of the Credit Agreement, as applicable, and, further, upon the release and termination of the security interest hereunder as provided in Section 21 hereof. (b) The Collateral Agent may, at any time and without notice to, or consent from the Grantor, transfer or direct the transfer of, funds from the Account Collateral to satisfy the Grantor's obligations under the Loan Documents and the Secured Hedge Agreements if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. SECTION 6. Representations and Warranties. Each Grantor represents and warrants as follows: (a) Such Grantor's exact legal name, as defined in Section 9-503(a) of the UCC, is correctly set forth in Schedule II hereto. Such Grantor is located (within the meaning of Section 9-307 of the UCC) and has its chief executive office in the state or jurisdiction set forth in Schedule II hereto. The information set forth in Schedule II hereto with respect to such Grantor is true and accurate in all respects. No Grantor has permitted a uniform commercial code financing statement to be filed in respect of it as debtor with respect to the Collateral under any other name, location, chief executive office, type of organization, jurisdiction of organization or organizational identification number than those set forth in Schedule II hereto except as disclosed in Schedule V hereto. (b) As of the Effective Date, the Inventory of such Grantor which is located at a distribution center, is located at a distribution center specified therefor in Schedule IV hereto, and such Grantor has exclusive possession and control of such Inventory other than such Inventory stored at any leased distribution center (which leased distribution center is so indicated by an asterisk on Schedule IV hereto), as Schedule IV may be amended from time to time pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof. All material Inventory of the Grantors, except Inventory in transit, is maintained in one or more States of the United States of America. All Initial Pledged Equity consisting of certificated securities and instruments as of the Effective Date have been delivered to the Collateral Agent. (c) Such Grantor is the legal and beneficial owner of the Collateral of such Grantor free and clear of any Lien, claim, option or right of others, except for (i) the security interest created under this Agreement, (ii) Liens in favor of landlords to secure payments under leases, in respect of that portion of the Inventory held at distribution centers leased from the respective landlord and (iii) Liens to secure obligations described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of Permitted Lien in the Credit Agreement (provided that such Liens are not material). No effective financing statement or other 6
instrument similar is in effect covering all or any part of such Collateral, except such as may have been filed in favor of the Collateral Agent relating to the Loan Documents or in respect of landlord Liens described in this Section 6(c). No Grantor has any trade names, except as listed on Schedule VI hereto. (d) The Pledged Equity pledged by such Grantor hereunder has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and non-assessable. (e) The Initial Pledged Equity pledged by such Grantor constitutes the percentage of the issued and outstanding shares of stock or equity interest of the issuers thereof indicated on Schedule III hereto. (f) All filings and other actions (including, without limitation, (A) actions necessary to obtain control of Collateral as provided in Sections 9-104, 9-105, 9-106 and 9-107 of the UCC and (B) actions necessary to perfect the Collateral Agent's security interest with respect to Security Collateral evidenced by a certificate) necessary to perfect the security interest in the Collateral of such Grantor created under this Agreement have been duly made or taken or will be duly made or taken, to the extent contemplated by the Credit Agreement, and upon the occurrence of such filings or actions, this Agreement will create in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties a valid and, together with such filings and other actions, perfected first priority security interest in such Security Collateral of such Grantor (except for Liens referred to in Section 6(c)(ii) and (iii) hereof), securing the payment of the Secured Obligations. (g) No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for (i) the grant by such Grantor of the security interest granted hereunder or for the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by such Grantor, (ii) the perfection or maintenance of the security interest created hereunder (including the first priority nature of such security interest), except for the filing of financing and continuation statements under the UCC, and the actions described in Section 4 hereof with respect to Security Collateral, which actions have been taken and are in full force and effect, or (iii) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of its voting or other rights provided for in this Agreement or the remedies in respect of the Collateral pursuant to this Agreement, except as may be required in connection with the disposition of any portion of the Security Collateral by laws affecting the offering and sale of securities generally. (h) No Grantor manufactures Inventory. All Inventory is manufactured by third parties under purchase orders which require compliance with among other things all applicable wage and hour and child labor laws (including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to the extent applicable). SECTION 7. Further Assurances. (a) Each Grantor agrees that from time to time, at the expense of such Grantor, such Grantor will promptly execute and deliver, or otherwise authenticate, all further instruments and documents, and take all further action that, in each case, may be necessary or proper, or that the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect any pledge or security interest granted or purported to be granted by 7
such Grantor hereunder or to enable the Collateral Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral of such Grantor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor will promptly with respect to Collateral of such Grantor: (i) execute or authenticate and file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or proper, or as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order to perfect and preserve the security interest granted or purported to be granted by such Grantor hereunder; (ii) deliver and pledge to the Collateral Agent for benefit of the Secured Parties certificates representing Security Collateral that constitutes certificated securities, accompanied by undated stock or bond powers executed in blank; and (iii) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Collateral Agent has control of Collateral consisting of investment property and transferable records as provided in Sections 9-105, 9-106 and 9-107 of the UCC. (b) Each Grantor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to file one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, including, without limitation, one or more financing statements indicating that such financing statements cover all or any part of the Collateral of such Grantor, in each case without the signature of such Grantor, and regardless of whether any particular asset described in such financing statements falls within the scope of the UCC. A photocopy or other reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement covering the Collateral or any part thereof shall be sufficient as a financing statement where permitted by law. (c) Each Grantor will furnish to the Collateral Agent from time to time (i) statements and schedules further identifying and describing the Collateral of such Grantor and such other reports in connection with such Collateral as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, all in reasonable detail, in order to perfect and preserve the security interests granted or purported to be granted hereunder; and such other information as may be reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent from time to time with respect to the Collateral (with any information request with respect to Inventory to be to the extent practicable consistent with such Grantor's existing internal management information reporting systems), and (ii) such information as is reasonably necessary so that the Collateral Agent from time to time and at any time can conduct or cause to be conducted a valuation of the Collateral (and with the out-of-pocket and documented expenses of the Collateral Agent in connection therewith to be paid by the Borrower pursuant to Section 17 hereof); provided, however, that except during the continuance of any Event of Default, during the term of this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall have the right to conduct or cause to be conducted only one such valuation. SECTION 8. As to Inventory. (a) To the extent Inventory of a Grantor is kept at a distribution center, such Grantor will keep such Inventory at the distribution centers specified on Schedule IV or, at such other distribution centers designated in a written notice by the Grantor to the Collateral Agent. Upon the giving of such notice, Schedule IV shall be automatically amended to add any new locations specified in the notice. (b) Each Grantor will pay promptly when due all property and other taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon, and all claims (including, without limitation, claims for labor, materials and supplies) against, the Inventory of such 8
Grantor, except to the extent payment thereof is not required by Article IV of the Credit Agreement. The purchase orders for all Inventory manufactured by third parties will require compliance with among other things all applicable wage and hour and child labor laws (including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to the extent applicable). SECTION 9. Insurance. Each Grantor will, at its own expense, maintain insurance with respect to the Inventory of such Grantor in such amounts, against such risks, in such form and with such insurers, as is customary for the industry; provided, that the Grantors may self-insure such risks in accordance with its past practices as of the date hereof and may in addition self-insure risks in amounts as are customarily self-insured by similarly situated Persons in the industry. SECTION 10. Post-Closing Changes; Bailees. (a) Each Grantor will provide written notice to the Collateral Agent of a change in such Grantor's name, type of organization, jurisdiction of organization, organizational identification number or location from those set forth on Schedule II of this Agreement within 30 days of such change, and shall take all action reasonably required by the Collateral Agent for the purpose of perfecting or protecting the security interest granted by this Agreement. No Grantor will become bound by a security agreement with respect to any of the Collateral authenticated by another Person (determined as provided in Section 9-203(d) of the UCC) without giving the Collateral Agent 30 days' prior written notice thereof and taking all action required by the Collateral Agent to ensure that the perfection and first priority nature of the Collateral Agent's security interest in the Collateral will be maintained. Each Grantor will hold and preserve its records relating to the Collateral and will permit representatives of the Collateral Agent at any time during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to inspect and make abstracts from such records. If the Grantor does not have an organizational identification number and later obtains one, it will forthwith notify the Collateral Agent of such organizational identification number. (b) If any material Inventory of any Grantor is at any time in the possession or control of a warehouseman, bailee or agent, and if any such Inventory is subject to a Lien based on statute or contract in favor of such warehouseman, bailee or agent and the Collateral Agent so requests such Grantor will (i) notify such warehouseman, bailee or agent of the security interest created hereunder, and (ii) instruct such warehouseman, bailee or agent to hold all such Inventory solely for the Collateral Agent's account subject only to the Collateral Agent's instructions (which shall permit such Inventory to be removed by such Grantor in the ordinary course of business until the Collateral Agent notifies such warehouseman, bailee or agent that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing). SECTION 11. Voting Rights; Dividends; Etc. (a) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or, if the Credit Agreement is no longer in effect, so long as no event has occurred and is continuing under any Secured Hedge Agreement or Operating Indebtedness Agreement which permits the respective Hedge Bank or Operating Lender to exercise its remedies thereunder: 9
(i) Each Grantor shall be entitled to exercise or refrain from exercising any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Security Collateral of such Grantor or any part thereof for any purpose. (ii) Each Grantor shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all dividends, interest and other distributions paid in respect of the Security Collateral of such Grantor if and to the extent that the payment thereof is not otherwise prohibited by the terms of the Loan Documents; provided, however, that any and all dividends, interest and other distributions paid or payable other than in cash in respect of, and instruments and other property received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, any Security Collateral, shall be, and shall be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent to hold as Security Collateral in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement). (iii) The Collateral Agent will execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to each Grantor all such proxies and other instruments as such Grantor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Grantor to exercise the voting and other rights that it is entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (i) above and to receive the dividends or interest payments that it is authorized to receive and retain pursuant to paragraph (ii) above. (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or, if the Credit Agreement is no longer in effect, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event under any Secured Hedge Agreement or Operating Indebtedness Agreement which permits the respective Hedge Bank or Operating Lender to exercise its remedies thereunder: (i) All rights of each Grantor (x) to exercise or refrain from exercising the voting and other consensual rights that it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 11(a)(i) hereof shall, upon notice to such Grantor by the Collateral Agent, cease and (y) to receive the dividends, interest and other distributions that it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof shall automatically cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise or refrain from exercising such voting and other consensual rights and to receive and hold as Security Collateral such dividends, interest and other distributions. (ii) All dividends, interest and other distributions that are received by any Grantor contrary to the provisions of paragraph (i) of this Section 11(b) shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Collateral Agent as Security Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement). 10
SECTION 12. Transfers and Other Liens; Additional Shares. (a) Each Grantor agrees that it will not (i) sell, assign or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, any of the Collateral, other than sales, assignments and other dispositions of the Collateral, and options relating to the Collateral, permitted under the terms of this Agreement or the Credit Agreement, or (ii) create or suffer to exist any Lien upon or with respect to any of the Collateral of such Grantor except for the pledge, assignment and security interest created under this Agreement and those Liens referred to in Section 6(c)(ii) and (iii) hereof. (b) Each Grantor agrees that it will (i) cause each of its wholly-owned Domestic Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries but including first-tier Special Purpose Subsidiaries) which is the issuer of the Pledged Equity pledged by such Grantor not to issue any stock or other Equity Interests or other securities in addition to or in substitution for the Pledged Equity issued by such issuer, except to such Grantor, and (ii) pledge hereunder, promptly following its acquisition (directly or indirectly) thereof, any and all additional Pledged Equity and other equity interests in accordance with the Credit Agreement. SECTION 13. Collateral Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. (a) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent such Grantor's attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or otherwise, from time to time, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or, if the Credit Agreement is no longer in effect, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event under a Secured Hedge Agreement or Operating Indebtedness Agreement which permits the respective Hedge Bank or Operating Lender to exercise its remedies thereunder, in the Collateral Agent's discretion, to take any action and to execute any instrument that the Collateral Agent may deem reasonably necessary or proper to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation: (b) to ask for, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compromise, receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under or in respect of any of the Collateral, (c) to receive, indorse and collect any drafts or other instruments, documents and chattel paper, in connection with clause (a) above, and (d) to file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings that the Collateral Agent may deem reasonably necessary or proper for the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights of the Collateral Agent with respect to any of the Collateral. SECTION 14. Collateral Agent May Perform. If any Grantor fails to perform any agreement contained herein after receipt of written notice thereof from the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent may, but without any obligation to do so, itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by such Grantor under Section 17 hereof. 11
SECTION 15. The Collateral Agent's Duties. (a) The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent hereunder are solely to protect the Secured Parties' interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the exercise of reasonable care in the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral, as to ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not any Secured Party has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property. (b) The Collateral Agent may from time to time, upon prior written notice to the Borrower, when the Collateral Agent deems it to be reasonably necessary in order to preserve and protect the Collateral, appoint one or more subagents (each a "Subagent") for the Collateral Agent hereunder with respect to all or any part of the Collateral. In the event that the Collateral Agent so appoints any Subagent with respect to any Collateral, (i) the assignment and pledge of such Collateral and the security interest granted in such Collateral by each Grantor hereunder shall be deemed for purposes of this Security Agreement to have been made to such Subagent, in addition to the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, as security for the Secured Obligations of such Grantor, (ii) such Subagent shall automatically be vested, in addition to the Collateral Agent, with all rights, powers, privileges, interests and remedies of the Collateral Agent hereunder with respect to such Collateral, and (iii) the term "Agent," when used herein in relation to any rights, powers, privileges, interests and remedies of the Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral, shall include such Subagent; provided, however, that no such Subagent shall be authorized to take any action with respect to any such Collateral unless and except to the extent expressly authorized in writing by the Collateral Agent. SECTION 16. Remedies. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or, if the Credit Agreement is no longer in effect, then if an event shall have occurred and be continuing under a Secured Hedge Agreement or Operating Indebtedness Agreement which permits the respective Hedge Bank or Operating Lender to exercise its remedies thereunder: (a) The Collateral Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default under the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) and also may: (i) require each Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it will at its expense and upon request of the Collateral Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by the Collateral Agent and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place and time to be designated by the Collateral Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties; (ii) without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of the Collateral Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent may deem 12
commercially reasonable; (iii) occupy any premises owned or leased by any of the Grantors where the Collateral or any part thereof is assembled or located for a reasonable period in order to effectuate its rights and remedies hereunder or under law, without obligation to such Grantor in respect of such occupation; and (iv) exercise any and all rights and remedies of any of the Grantors under or in connection with the Collateral, or otherwise in respect of the Collateral, including, without limitation, (A) any and all rights of such Grantor to demand or otherwise require payment of any amount under the Collateral, (B) withdraw, or cause or direct the withdrawal, of all funds with respect to the L/C Collateral Account and (C) exercise all other rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 9-607 of the UCC. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days' notice to such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. (b) Any cash held by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent in accordance with this Agreement and all cash proceeds received by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral may, in the discretion of the Collateral Agent, be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter applied (after payment of any amounts payable to the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 17 hereof) in whole or in part by the Collateral Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties against, all or any part of the Secured Obligations, in the following manner: (i) first, amounts then on deposit in the L/C Collateral Account shall be applied to reimburse the respective Issuing Bank for any payments by such Issuing Banks under its respective Letters of Credit as provided in Sections 3.12(c) and 3.15 of the Credit Agreement, with any surplus after such reimbursements then to be applied solely in accordance with the remaining order of priority set out in this Section 16(b); (ii) second, paid to the Collateral Agent for any amounts then owing to the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement or otherwise under the Loan Documents; (iii) third, (A) paid to the Secured Parties, for any amounts then owing to them, in their capacities as such, under the Loan Documents, the Secured Hedge Agreements and the Operating Indebtedness Agreements ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then owing to such Secured Parties, provided that, for purposes of this Section 16, the amount owing to any Hedge Bank pursuant to any Secured Hedge Agreement to which it is a party (other than any amount theretofore accrued and unpaid) shall be deemed to be equal to the Agreement Value (as defined below) therefor and (B) with any surplus to be deposited as Collateral in the L/C Collateral Account up to an amount equal to 13
100% of the aggregate outstanding Letter of Credit Liability, provided that in the event that any such Letter of Credit is drawn, the Collateral Agent shall pay to the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit the amount held in the L/C Collateral Account in respect of such Letter of Credit, provided further that, to the extent that any such Letter of Credit shall expire or terminate undrawn and as a result thereof the amount of the Collateral in the L/C Collateral Account shall exceed 100% of the aggregate Letter of Credit Liability then outstanding, such excess amount of such Collateral shall be applied in accordance with the remaining order of priority set out in this Section 16(b); and (iv) fourth, any surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by or on the behalf of the Collateral Agent and remaining after payment in full of all the Secured Obligations shall be paid over to the applicable Grantor or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. For purposes of this Agreement, "Agreement Value" means, for each Secured Hedge Agreement, on any date of determination, an amount reasonably determined by the Collateral Agent equal to: (a) in the case of a Secured Hedge Agreement documented pursuant to the Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) published by the International Swap and Derivatives Association, Inc. (the "Master Agreement"), the amount, if any, that would be payable by any Loan Party to its counterparty in respect of such Secured Hedge Agreement, as if (i) such Secured Hedge Agreement was being terminated early on such date of determination, (ii) such Loan Party was the sole "Affected Party", and (iii) the Collateral Agent was the sole party determining such payment amount (with the Collateral Agent making such determination pursuant to the provisions of that specific form of Master Agreement); or (b) in the case of a Secured Hedge Agreement traded on an exchange, the mark-to-market value of such Secured Hedge Agreement, which will be unrealized gain or loss on such Secured Hedge Agreement to the Loan Party to such Secured Hedge Agreement reasonably determined by the Collateral Agent based on the settlement price of such Secured Hedge Agreement on such date of determination, or (c) in all other cases, the mark-to-market value of such Secured Hedge Agreement, which will be the unrealized gain or loss on such Secured Hedge Agreement to the Loan Party to such Secured Hedge Agreement reasonably determined by the Collateral Agent as the amount, if any, by which (i) the present value of the future cash flows to be paid by such Loan Party exceeds (ii) the present value of the future cash flows to be received by such Loan Party pursuant to such Secured Hedge Agreement; capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this definition shall have the respective meaning set forth in the above described Master Agreement. (c) All payments received by any Grantor in respect of the Collateral shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Collateral Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement). SECTION 17. Indemnity and Expenses. (a) Each Grantor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Secured Party and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against, and shall pay on demand, any and all claims, damages, losses (other than lost profits), liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable and documented fees and out-of-pocket 14
expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or resulting from any enforcement, investigation, litigation or proceeding related to this Agreement, except to the extent such claim, damage, liability or expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. (b) Each Grantor will upon demand pay to the Collateral Agent the amount of any and all reasonable and documented expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable and documented fees and out-of-pocket expenses of its counsel and of any experts and agents, that the Collateral Agent may incur in connection with (i) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale of, collection from or other realization upon, any of the Collateral of such Grantor, (ii) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Collateral Agent or the other Secured Parties hereunder or (iii) the failure by such Grantor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. SECTION 18. Amendments; Waivers; Additional Grantors; Etc. (a) No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Grantor herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Collateral Agent, and, in the case of any such amendment or modification by the Grantors, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given, provided, that this Agreement may be modified to the extent provided therein by the execution of a Security Agreement Supplement by an Additional Guarantor in accordance with Section 18(b) hereof. No failure on the part of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising any right hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. (b) Upon the execution and delivery, or authentication, by any Person of a security agreement supplement in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto (each a "Security Agreement Supplement"), (i) such Person shall be referred to as an "Additional Grantor" and shall be and become a Grantor hereunder, and each reference in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to "Grantor" shall also mean and be a reference to such Additional Grantor, and each reference in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to "Collateral" shall also mean and be a reference to the Collateral of such Additional Grantor, and (ii) the supplemental schedules I-IX attached to each Security Agreement Supplement shall be incorporated into and become a part of and supplement Schedules I-IX, respectively, hereto, and the Collateral Agent may attach such supplemental schedules to such Schedules; and each reference to such Schedules shall mean and be a reference to such Schedules as supplemented pursuant to each Security Agreement Supplement. SECTION 19. Notices; Etc. All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopier or electronic mail) and mailed, sent by overnight courier, telecopied, emailed, or delivered, in the case of the Borrower or the Collateral Agent, addressed to it at its address specified in the Credit Agreement and, in the case of each Grantor other than the Borrower, addressed to it at its address set forth opposite such Grantor's 15
name on the signature pages hereto or on the signature page to the Security Agreement Supplement pursuant to which it became a party hereto; or, as to any party, at such other address or to such other person as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties. All such notices and other communications shall, when mailed, be effective three days after being deposited in the mails, when sent by overnight courier, be effective one day after being sent by overnight courier, and when telecopied or sent by electronic mail, be effective when received (and, with respect to notices and communications sent by electronic mail, upon confirmation by the recipient of the receipt of such notice or communication), respectively; and when delivered by hand, be effective upon delivery; except that notices and other communications to the Collateral Agent shall not be effective until received by the Collateral Agent. Delivery by telecopier of an executed counterpart of any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or of any Security Agreement Supplement or Schedule hereto shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart thereof. SECTION 20. Continuing Security Interest; Assignments under the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the latest of (i) the payment in full in cash of the Secured Obligations, (ii) the Termination Date and (iii) the termination or expiration of all Letters of Credit and all Secured Hedge Agreements and all Operating Indebtedness Agreements, (b) be binding upon each Grantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Secured Parties and their respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (c), but subject to Section 10.07 of the Credit Agreement, any Lender Party may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes, if any, held by it) to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Lender Party herein or otherwise. SECTION 21. Release; Termination. (a) While the Credit Agreement is in effect, upon any sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of any item of Collateral of any Grantor in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and thereafter in accordance with the requirements (if any) of the Secured Hedge Agreements and the Operating Indebtedness Agreements, the security interest granted hereby in such Collateral shall immediately and automatically terminate and all rights to such Collateral shall revert to the applicable Grantors without any further action by the Collateral Agent, any Lender Party, any Hedge Bank, any Operating Lender or any other Person effective as of the time of such sale, lease, transfer or other disposition.

Exhibit F-1 June [ ], 2003 Citicorp USA, Inc., as Agent The Lenders and Issuing Banks (as defined below) listed on Schedule I hereto Re: The Gap, Inc./Credit Agreement Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Senior Vice President and General Counsel to The Gap, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the domestic subsidiaries of the Company listed on Schedule II hereto (the "Delaware Subsidiaries"), the domestic subsidiaries of the Company listed on Schedule III hereto (the "California Subsidiaries"; and together with the Delaware Subsidiaries, the "Subsidiaries"; and together with the Company and the Delaware Subsidiaries, the "Loan Parties"), in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement, dated as of June __, 2003 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company and the Subsidiary Borrowers, the LC Subsidiaries, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement), Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGMI") and Banc of America Securities LLC ("BAS") as Joint Book Managers, BAS, HSBC Bank USA and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPM") as Co-Syndication Agents, CGMI, BAS and JPM as Joint Lead Arrangers, and Citicorp USA, Inc. as agent for the Lenders and the Issuing Banks (in such capacity, the "Agent"), and certain other agreements, instruments and documents related to the Credit Agreement. This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(b)(viii) of the Credit Agreement. In my examination I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures including endorsements, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. As to any facts material to this opinion which I did not independently establish or verify, I have relied upon statements and representations of the Loan Parties and their officers and other representatives and of public officials, including the facts and conclusions set forth therein.
In rendering the opinions set forth herein, I have examined and relied on originals or copies of the following: (a) the Credit Agreement; (b) the Promissory Notes executed by the Loan Parties; (c) the Subsidiary Guaranty, dated as of June __, 2003 (the "Subsidiary Guaranty"), made by the Subsidiaries party thereto in favor of the Lender Parties; (d) the Security Agreement, dated as of June __, 2003 (the "Security Agreement"), from the Loan Parties party thereto (the "Grantors") in favor of the Agent as Collateral Agent (in such capacity, the "Collateral Agent"); (e) certified copies of the respective Constitutive Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of each Loan Party; (f) certified copies of certain resolutions of the respective boards of directors, the managers or the partners, as the case may be, of each Loan Party adopted on May 29, 2003, in the case of the Company, on June 11, 2003, in the case of GPS Brand Services, Inc. and on June 4, 2003, in the case of each of the other Subsidiaries; (g) certificates, dated on or about the date hereof, from the Secretary of State of the State of California and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as to the good standing of each of the Loan Parties in their respective jurisdictions of organization; and (h) such other documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below. I am a member of the bar of the State of California and am expressing no opinion as to the law of any other jurisdiction other than (i) the laws of the State of California, (ii) the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, (iii) the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware, and (iv) the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (collectively, the "Applicable Law"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings herein as ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement, the Promissory Notes, the Security Agreement and the Subsidiary 2
Guaranty shall hereinafter be referred to collectively as the "Transaction Agreements." "Governmental Approval" means any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority pursuant to Applicable Law. "Applicable Contracts" means those material agreements, indentures or instruments (x) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits attached to or incorporated by reference in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ending May 3, 2003, and which, after due inquiry, are specifically applicable to any of the Loan Parties in connection with the Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereunder or (y) which, to my knowledge, are specifically applicable to any of the Loan Parties in connection with the Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereunder. The Lenders and the Issuing Banks are collectively referred to herein as the "Lender Parties". Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that: 1. Each of the California Subsidiaries is authorized to exercise all its powers, rights and privileges and is in good legal standing under the laws of the State of California, and each of the Company and the Delaware Subsidiaries is validly existing and in good standing under the Applicable Law of the State of Delaware. 2. Each Loan Party has the power and authority to execute, deliver and perform all of its obligations under each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party, and the execution and delivery of each of the Transaction Agreements by each Loan Party which is a party thereto and the consummation by each Loan Party of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of each Loan Party. Each of the Transaction Agreements has been duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party which is a party thereto. 3. The execution and delivery by each Loan Party of each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and the performance by each Loan Party of its obligations under each of the Transaction Agreements, each in accordance with its terms, does not (i) conflict with the Constitutive Documents of each of the Loan Parties, (ii) constitute a violation of, or a default under, any Applicable Contracts or (iii) cause the creation of any security interest or lien (other than the liens granted under, or created by, the Loan Documents) upon any of the property of the Loan Parties pursuant to any Applicable Contracts to which it is a party. I call to your attention that certain of the Applicable Contracts are governed by laws other 3
than those as to which I express my opinion. I express no opinion as to the effect of such other laws on the opinions herein stated. 4. Neither the execution, delivery nor performance by any Loan Party of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party will contravene any provision of any Applicable Law. 5. No Governmental Approval, which has not been obtained or taken and is not in full force and effect, is required to authorize, or is required in connection with, the execution, delivery or performance of any of the Transaction Agreements by any Loan Party. 6. There is no action, suit or proceeding pending or, to my knowledge, overtly threatened against any Loan Party in or before any court, Governmental Authority or arbitrator, which has a reasonable probability (taking into account the exhaustion of all appeals and the assertion of all defenses) of having a Material Adverse Effect or which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any Loan Document. 4
This opinion is being furnished only to you in connection with the Transaction Agreements and is solely for your benefit and is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person or entity (other than your successors or assigns as Lender Parties) for any purpose without our prior written consent.

Exhibit F-2 June [ ], 2003 Citicorp USA, Inc., as Collateral Agent The Lenders and Issuing Banks (as defined below) listed on Schedule I hereto Re: The Gap, Inc./Credit Agreement Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as special counsel to The Gap, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the domestic subsidiaries of the Company listed on Schedule II hereto (the "Subsidiaries"; together with the Company, the "Grantors") in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Security Agreement, dated as of June [ ], 2003 (the "Security Agreement"), from the Grantors referred to therein to Citicorp USA, Inc. ("CUSA") as Collateral Agent (the "Collateral Agent"). This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(b)(ix) of the Credit Agreement, dated as of June [ ], 2003 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company and the LC Subsidiaries, the Subsidiary Borrowers, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement), Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGMI") and Banc of America Securities LLC ("BAS") as Joint Book Managers, BAS, HSBC Bank USA and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPM") as Co-Syndication Agents, CGMI, BAS and JPM as Joint Lead Arrangers, and CUSA as Agent for the Lenders and the Issuing Banks. In our examination we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures including endorsements, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. As to any facts material to this opinion which we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon
statements and representations of the Grantors and its officers and other representatives and of public officials, including the facts and conclusions set forth therein. In rendering the opinions set forth herein, we have examined and relied on originals or copies of the following: 1. the Security Agreement; 2. unfiled copies of financing statements one for each Grantor in Part A of Schedule II hereto (the "Delaware Grantors") and identifying such Grantor as debtor and "Citicorp USA, Inc., Collateral Agent" as secured party, which we understand will be filed in the office of the Secretary of State of Delaware (such filing office, the "Delaware Filing Office" and such financing statements, the "Delaware Financing Statements"); 3. unfiled copies of financing statements one for each Grantor in Part B of Schedule II hereto (the "California Grantors") and identifying such Grantor as debtor and "Citicorp USA, Inc., Collateral Agent as secured party, which we understand will be filed in the office of the Secretary of State of California (such filing office, the "California Filing Office" and such financing statements, the "California Financing Statements", together with the Delaware Financing Statements, the "Financing Statements"); 4. certified copies of the certificates of incorporation or certificate of formation of each Delaware Grantor, as applicable, from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as to each Delaware Grantor's existence in such state (the "Delaware Secretary of State Certificates"); 5. certified copies of the certificates of incorporation or certificate of formation of each California Grantor, as applicable, from the Secretary of State of the State of California as to each California Grantor's existence in such state (the "California Secretary of State Certificates"); and 6. such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings herein as set forth in the Security Agreement. As used herein: 2
1. "New York UCC" means the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect on the date hereof in the State of New York (without regard to laws referenced in Section 9-201 thereof). 2. "California UCC" means the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect on the date hereof in the State of California (without regard to laws referenced in Section 9201 thereof). 3. "Delaware UCC" means the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect on the date hereof in the State of Delaware (without regard to laws referenced in Section 9-201 thereof). 4. "UCC" means (a) the New York UCC, (b) the California UCC, and (c) the Delaware UCC (in each case as such term is defined below), as applicable. 5. "Possessory Certificates" means that portion of the Initial Pledged Equity which constitute "certificated securities" as defined in Section 8-102 of the UCC, as identified on Schedule III hereto and delivered on the date hereof. 6. "UCC Collateral" means the Inventory and Initial Pledged Equity (as such terms are defined in the Security Agreement) to the extent the UCC governs a security interest in such collateral. We express no opinion with respect to any laws other than (1) the UCC, (2) for purposes of opinion paragraph 5, the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act and (3) for purposes of opinion paragraph 9, the California General Corporation Law, the California Limited Liability Company Act and the California Uniform Limited Partnership Act. We have this date delivered to you our opinion with respect to the enforceability of the Security Agreement and certain other transaction agreements. We call to your attention that the opinions set forth herein with respect to the security interest of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties are subject to the qualifications contained in such other opinion. Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: 3
(1) Under the New York UCC, the provisions of the Security Agreement are effective to create a valid security interest in each Grantor's rights in the UCC Collateral in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties to secure the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement). (2) To the extent the Delaware UCC is applicable to the authorization of the Delaware Financing Statements, pursuant to the provisions of the Security Agreement the Delaware Grantors have authorized the filing of the Delaware Financing Statements for purposes of Section 9-509 of the Delaware UCC. (3) To the extent the Delaware UCC is applicable, the Delaware Financing Statements include not only all of the types of information required by Section 9-502(a) of the Delaware UCC, but also the types of information without which the Delaware Filing Office may refuse to accept the Delaware Financing Statements pursuant to Section 9-516 of the Delaware UCC. (4) To the extent the Delaware UCC is applicable, the security interest of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties will be perfected in each Delaware Grantor's rights in all UCC Collateral upon the later of the attachment of the security interest and the filing of the Delaware Financing Statement naming such Delaware Grantor as debtor in the Delaware Filing Office; provided, however, we express no opinion with respect to (i) money, (ii) deposit accounts, (iii) letter of credit rights, (iv) goods covered by a certificate of title statute, (v) as-extracted collateral, e.g., timber to be cut, or (vi) any property subject to a statute, regulation or treaty of the United States whose requirements for a security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property preempt Section 9-310(a) of the Delaware UCC. (5) You have asked whether each of the Delaware Grantors is a "registered organization" as such term is defined in Section 9-102(a)(70) of the Delaware UCC. Pursuant to Section 9-102(a)(70) of the Delaware UCC, a "registered organization" must be (i) organized solely under the laws of a single State (or the United States) and (ii) the State (or the United States) must maintain a public record showing the organization to have been organized. Pursuant to Section 103(c)(6) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 18-201(a) of the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware and Section 17-201(a) of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware is required to maintain a public record showing each of the Delaware Grantors to have been organized. Based on our review of the Delaware Secretary of State Certificates and to the extent the Delaware UCC is applicable, each of the Delaware Grantors is a 4
"registered organization" under Section 9-102(a)(70) of the Delaware UCC and, where applicable, the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. We have assumed that none of the Delaware Grantors has filed a certificate of incorporation or any similar document under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware and that the internal affairs of the Delaware Grantors are not otherwise subject to the laws of any other jurisdiction. We call to your attention that to the extent that the internal affairs of the Delaware Grantors are subject to regulation under the laws of another state, the State of Delaware may recognize such authority. See, e.g., McDermott Inc. v. Lewis, 531 A.2d 206 (Del. 1987). Further, we have assumed that none of the Delaware Grantors has and will not file (A) any certificates of transfer, continuance or domestication, or any similar certificates in the State of Delaware pursuant to Sections 390(a) and 388(b)(1) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 18-213 of the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware, or Section 17-216 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or (B) any similar certificates in any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. (6) To the extent the California UCC is applicable to the authorization of the California Financing Statements, pursuant to the provisions of the Security Agreement the California Grantors have authorized the filing of the California Financing Statements for purposes of Section 9509 of the California UCC. (7) To the extent the California UCC is applicable, the California Financing Statements include not only all of the types of information required by Section 9502(a) of the California UCC, but also the types of information without which the California Filing Office may refuse to accept the California Financing Statements pursuant to Section 9516 of the California UCC. (8) To the extent the California UCC is applicable, the security interest of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties will be perfected in each California Grantor's rights in all UCC Collateral upon the later of the attachment of the security interest and the filing of the California Financing Statement naming such California Grantor as debtor in the California Filing Office; provided, however, we express no opinion with respect to (i) money, (ii) deposit accounts, (iii) letter of credit rights, (iv) goods covered by a certificate of title statute, (v) as-extracted collateral, e.g., timber to be cut, or (vi) any property subject to a statute, regulation or treaty of the United States whose requirements for a security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property preempt Section 9310(a) of the California UCC. 5
(9) You have asked whether each of the California Grantors is a "registered organization" as such term is defined in Section 9102(a)(70) of the California UCC. Pursuant to Section 9102(a)(70) of the California UCC, a "registered organization" must be (i) organized solely under the laws of a single State (or the United States) and (ii) the State (or the United States) must maintain a public record showing the organization to have been organized. Pursuant to Sections 110(a) and 209 of the California General Corporation Law, Sections 17050 and 17052 of the California Limited Liability Company Act, Sections 15621 and 15628 of the California Uniform Limited Partnership Act and Sections 12160 and 12168 of the California Government Code, the Secretary of State of the State of California is required to maintain a public record showing each of the California Grantors to have been organized. Based on our review of the California Secretary of State Certificates and to the extent the California UCC is applicable, each of the California Grantors is a "registered organization" under Section 9102(a)(70) of the California UCC and, where applicable, the California General Corporation Law, the California Limited Liability Company Act and the California Uniform Limited Partnership Act. (10) Assuming that neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party has notice of any adverse claims with respect to the Possessory Certificates then, upon the later of the attachment of the security interest and the delivery of such Possessory Certificates to the Collateral Agent in the State of California indorsed, by an effective indorsement, either in blank or to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent will acquire such Possessory Certificates (and the shares represented thereby) free of any adverse claims under Section 8303 of the California UCC. As used herein, "notice of adverse claim" has the meaning set forth in Section 8105 of the California UCC and includes, without limitation, any adverse claim that the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party would discover upon any investigation which such person has a duty, imposed by statute or regulation, to investigate. Our opinions are subject to the following qualifications: (1) We have assumed that each Grantor owns, or with respect to after-acquired property will own, the UCC Collateral, and we express no opinion as to the nature or extent of each Grantor's rights in any of the UCC Collateral and we note that with respect to any after-acquired property, the security interest will not attach until each Grantor acquires ownership thereof. 6
(2) Our opinion with respect to proceeds is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9-315 of the UCC and, in addition, we call to your attention that in the case of certain types of proceeds, other parties such as holders in due course, protected purchasers of securities, persons who obtain control over securities entitlements and buyers in the ordinary course of business may acquire a superior interest or may take their interest free of the security interest of a secured party. (3) We express no opinion with respect to any goods which are accessions to, or commingled or processed with, other goods to the extent that the security interest is limited by Section 9-335 or 9-336 of the UCC. (4) We express no opinion with respect to the choice of law governing perfection, the effect of perfection and non-perfection or priority of the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the UCC Collateral. (5) We call to your attention that the right of the Collateral Agent to become a partner or member in UCC Collateral constituting a partnership or limited liability company may be limited by applicable law and the terms of the partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement pursuant to which the partnership or limited liability company was formed, as amended from time to time, and that the only remedy may be the right to receive distributions to which the respective Grantor is otherwise entitled pursuant to the partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement. (6) We have assumed that each Grantor has all necessary authorization under its organizational documents and applicable law (other than the UCC) for the filing of the Financing Statements. (7) We call to your attention that in the case of goods subject to a negotiable document of title, a security interest perfected in the negotiable document has priority over any security interest perfected in such goods by another method. (8) We express no opinion with respect to the security interest of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties except to the extent that the Collateral Agent has been duly appointed as agent for such persons as of the date hereof. 7
This opinion is being furnished only to you in connection with the Security Agreement and is solely for your benefit and is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person or entity (other than your successors or assigns as Lender Parties (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) for any purpose without our prior written consent.

Exhibit F-3 June [__], 2003 Citicorp USA, Inc., as Agent The Lenders and Issuing Banks (as defined below) listed on Schedule I hereto Re: The Gap, Inc./Credit Agreement Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as special counsel to The Gap, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the domestic subsidiaries of the Company listed on Schedule II hereto (the "Subsidiaries"; together with the Company, the "Loan Parties") in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement, dated as of June __, 2003 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company and the LC Subsidiaries, the Subsidiary Borrowers, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement), Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGMI") and Banc of America Securities LLC ("BAS") as Joint Book Managers, BAS, HSBC Bank USA and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("JPM") as Co-Syndication Agents, CGMI, BAS and JPM as Joint Lead Arrangers, and Citicorp USA, Inc. as agent for the Lenders and the Issuing Banks (in such capacity, the "Agent"), and certain other agreements, instruments and documents related to the Credit Agreement. This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(b)(ix) of the Credit Agreement. In our examination we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures including endorsements, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as facsimile, electronic, certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. As to any facts material to this opinion which we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon statements and representations of the Loan Parties and their officers and other representatives and of public officials, including the facts and conclusions set forth therein. In rendering the opinions set forth herein, we have examined and relied on originals or copies of the following:
(a) the Credit Agreement; (b) the Promissory Notes executed by the Loan Parties; (c) the Subsidiary Guaranty, dated as of June __, 2003 (the "Subsidiary Guaranty"), made by the Subsidiaries party thereto in favor of the Lender Parties; (d) the Security Agreement, dated as of June __, 2003 (the "Security Agreement"), from the Loan Parties party thereto (the "Grantors") in favor of the Agent as Collateral Agent (in such capacity, the "Collateral Agent"); (e) the certificate of Sabrina Simmons, the Senior Vice President and Treasurer, and Lauri M. Shanahan, the Senior Vice President and General Counsel, respectively, of each of the Loan Parties, dated the date hereof, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A hereto; and (f) such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below. We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than (i) the Applicable Laws of the State of New York and (ii) the Applicable Laws of the United States of America (including, without limitation, Regulations U and X of the Federal Reserve Board). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings herein as ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement, the Promissory Notes, the Security Agreement, and the Subsidiary Guaranty shall hereinafter be referred to collectively as the "Transaction Agreements." "Applicable Laws" shall mean those laws, rules and regulations which, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, without our having made any special investigation as to the applicability of any specific law, rule or regulation, and which are not the subject of a specific opinion herein referring expressly to a particular law or laws. "Governmental Approval" means any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority pursuant to the Applicable Laws of the State of New York or of the United States of America. The Lenders and the Issuing Banks are collectively referred to herein as the "Lender Parties". References to the "UCC" shall mean the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect on the date hereof in the State of New York. Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. Each of the Transaction Agreements constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party which is a party thereto, enforceable against each such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, under the Applicable Laws of the State of New York. 2. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by any Loan Party of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party, nor the compliance by any Loan Parties with the terms and provisions thereof will contravene any provision of any Applicable Law of the State of New York or any Applicable Law of the United States of America. 3. No Governmental Approval, which has not been obtained or taken and is not in full force and effect, is required to authorize, or is required in connection with, the execution or delivery of any of the Transaction Agreements by any Loan Party or the enforceability of any of the Transaction Agreements against any Loan Party. 4. The Loan Parties are not and, solely after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements to which they are a party, will not be subject to registration and regulation as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 5. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by any Loan Party of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party nor the compliance by such Loan Party with the terms and provisions thereof will violate any provision of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended. Our opinions are subject to the following assumptions and qualifications: (a) enforcement of the Transaction Agreements may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law); (b) we have assumed that each of the Transaction Agreements constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each party thereto (other than the Loan Parties to the extent expressly set forth herein) enforceable against such other party (other than the Loan Parties to the extent expressly set forth herein) in accordance with its terms; (c) we express no opinion as to the effect on the opinions expressed herein of (i) the compliance or non-compliance of the Agent or any party (other than
the Loan Parties to the extent expressly set forth herein) to the Transaction Agreements with any state, federal or other laws or regulations applicable to them or (ii) the legal or regulatory status or the nature of the business of the Agent; (d) we express no opinion as to the enforceability of any rights to contribution or indemnification provided for in the Transaction Agreements which are violative of the public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation); (e) we express no opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer or similar law on the Transaction Agreements or any transactions contemplated thereby; (f) we express no opinion as to the applicability or effect of any preference or similar law on the Transaction Agreements or any transaction contemplated thereby; (g) we express no opinion on the enforceability of any provision in a Transaction Agreement purporting to prohibit, restrict or condition the assignment of rights under such Transaction Agreement to the extent such restriction on assignability is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code; (h) we express no opinion as to the enforceability of any section of any Transaction Agreement to the extent it purports to waive any objection a person may have that a suit, action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum; (i) our opinion with respect to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of the Transaction Agreements is rendered in reliance upon the Act of July 19, 1984, ch. 421, 1984 McKinney's Sess. Laws of N.Y. 1406 (codified at N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law Sections 5-1401, 5-1402 (McKinney 2001) and N.Y. CPLR 327(b) (McKinney 2001)) and is subject to the qualifications that such enforceability may be limited by public policy considerations of any jurisdiction, other than the courts of the State of New York, in which enforcement of such provisions, or of a judgment upon an agreement containing such provisions, is sought; (j) in the case of the Subsidiary Guaranty certain of the provisions, including waivers, with respect to the Subsidiary Guaranty are or may be unenforceable in whole or in part, but the inclusion of such provisions does not affect the validity of the Subsidiary Guaranty, taken as a whole; (k) certain of the remedial provisions with respect to the security contained in the Security Agreement may be unenforceable in whole or in part, but
the inclusion of such provisions does not affect the validity of the Security Agreement, taken as a whole, and the Security Agreement, taken as a whole, together with applicable law, contains adequate provisions for the practical realization of the benefits of the security; (l) we express no opinion with respect to Section 15 of the Security Agreement to the extent it establishes a standard of care for collateral in the possession or control of the Collateral Agent to the extent such standard of care is unenforceable under Sections 1-102 and 9-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code; (m) we express no opinion with respect to Article 3 of the Credit Agreement to the extent it excuses the issuer of a letter of credit from liability to the extent such provision is unenforceable pursuant to Section 5-103 of the Uniform Commercial Code; (n) we express no opinion with respect to any provision of the Credit Agreement to the extent it authorizes or permits any purchaser of a participation interest to set-off or apply any deposit, property or indebtedness with respect to any participation interest; (o) we express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of Section 10.15 of the Credit Agreement to the extent such provision purports to select a governing law in conflict with mandatory choice of law rules set forth in Section 5-116 of the Uniform Commercial Code; and (p) we express no opinion with respect to the validity, perfection or priority of any security interest. In rendering the foregoing opinions, we have assumed, with your consent, that: (a) each Loan Party is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation, a limited liability company or a limited partnership, as the case may be, under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization; (b) each Loan Party has the power and authority to execute, deliver and perform all of its respective obligations under each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and the execution and delivery of each of the Transaction Agreements by each Loan Party which is a party thereto and the consummation by each Loan Party of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of each Loan Party. Each of the Transaction Agreements has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each Loan Party which is a party thereto;
(c) the execution, delivery and performance of any obligations of each respective Loan Party under the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party does not and will not conflict with, contravene, violate or constitute a default under (i) (x) the Certificate of Incorporation, Articles of Incorporation, Certificate of Formation, Limited Liability Company Articles of Organization or Certificate of Limited Partnership or (y) the By-laws, Operating Agreement or Limited Partnership Agreement, as applicable, or their equivalent under the laws of the respective jurisdiction of organization, of each Loan Party, (ii) any lease, indenture, instrument or other agreement to which any Loan Party or its property is subject, (iii) any rule, law or regulation to which any Loan Party is subject (other than Applicable Laws of the State of New York and Applicable Laws of the United States of America as to which we express our opinion in paragraph 2 herein) or (iv) any judicial or administrative order or decree of any governmental authority; (d) no authorization, consent or other approval of, notice to or filing with any court, governmental authority or regulatory body (other than Governmental Approvals as to which we express our opinion in paragraph 3 herein) is required to authorize or is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by any Loan Party of any of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party or the transactions contemplated thereby; (e) we call to your attention that (i) effective enforcement of a claim denominated in a foreign currency may be limited by requirements that the claim (or a judgment in respect of such claim) be converted into United States dollars at a rate of exchange prevailing on a specified date and (ii) we express no opinion as to whether a federal or state court would award a judgment in a currency other than United States dollars; and (f) our opinion is subject to possible judicial action giving effect to governmental actions or foreign laws affecting creditors' rights. We understand that you are separately receiving opinions with respect to the foregoing assumptions from Lauri M. Shanahan, the Senior Vice President and General Counsel of each of the Loan Parties, and from Piper Rudnick LLP, counsel to GPS (Maryland), Inc., and we are advised that such opinions contain qualifications. Our opinions herein stated are based on the assumptions specified above and we express no opinion as to the effect on the opinions herein stated of the qualifications contained in such other opinions.
This opinion is being furnished only to you in connection with the Transaction Agreements and is solely for your benefit and is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or relied upon by any other person or entity (other than your successors or assigns as Lender Parties) for any purpose without our prior written consent.

Exhibit G OPINION OF SPECIAL NEW YORK COUNSEL TO THE AGENT June 24, 2003 To the Lenders and Issuing Banks party to the Credit Agreement referred to below and to Citicorp USA, Inc., as Agent Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as special New York counsel to Citicorp USA, Inc., individually and as Agent, in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement dated as of June 24, 2003 (the "Credit Agreement"), among The Gap, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), certain subsidiaries of the Borrower, certain other financial institutions and each of you. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined. In such capacity, we have examined a counterpart of the Credit Agreement, the notes delivered this date thereunder, the Subsidiary Guaranty and the Security Agreement. In our examination of the Credit Agreement and such other documents, we have assumed, without independent investigation (a) the due execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by all parties thereto, (b) the genuineness of all signatures, (c) the authenticity of the originals of the documents submitted to us and (d) the conformity to originals of any documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have assumed, without independent investigation, that (i) each Loan Party, each of the Lenders, and the Agent is a corporation or other entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) each Loan Party, each of the Lenders and the Agent has full power and authority (corporate and otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party, (iii) the execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party, each of the Lenders and the Agent of the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary action (corporate or otherwise) and do not (A) contravene the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other constituent documents of the Loan Parties, any of the Lenders or the Agent, (B) violate any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to the Loan Parties, any of the Lenders or the Agent or (C) conflict with or result in the breach of any document or instrument binding on the Loan Parties, any of the Lenders or the Agent and, (iv) no authorization, approval, consent or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body or any other third party is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Loan Parties, any of the Lenders or the Agent of the Loan Documents or, if any such authorization, approval, consent, action, notice or filing is required thereof, it has been duly obtained or made and is in full force and effect. Exh. G Page 1
Based upon the foregoing examination and assumptions and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that the Loan Documents are the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party thereto, enforceable against each such Loan Party in accordance with its respective terms. Our opinion above is subject to the following qualifications: (i) Our opinion above is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors' rights generally. (ii) Our opinion above is also subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including (without limitation) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (iii) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of the indemnification provisions set forth in the Loan Documents to the extent enforcement thereof is contrary to public policy regarding the exculpation of criminal violations, intentional harm and acts of gross negligence or recklessness. We express no opinion as to the creation, perfection or priority of any security interests. (iv) Our opinion above is limited to the law of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States of America and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the effect of the law of a jurisdiction other than the State of New York wherein any of the Lenders may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement may be sought that limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO  Wednesday, June 25, 2003  Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) today announced the completion with major commercial banks of a three-year secured $750 million revolving credit facility. In addition, the company has executed agreements securing $1.2 billion in letter of credit issuing capacity. The letter of credit agreements also have three-year terms and will be secured by about $1.2 billion in cash, using a portion of the company's large cash balances.
 
The new facilities replace a two-year $1.4 billion secured facility scheduled to expire in March 2004. By securing the new letter of credit facility with cash, the company is minimizing the credit risk to issuing banks and will reduce its net interest expense. The cash securing the letter of credit facility will be reported as "restricted cash" on the company's balance sheet; the company will continue earning interest income on the restricted cash. The company had a $2.8 billion cash balance at the end of its first quarter.
 
Based on these new facilities, the company expects to save about $10 million in interest for the remainder of its 2003 fiscal year. As a result, the company expects gross interest expense for the 2003 fiscal year to be $240 million to $245 million compared with the previous guidance of $250 million to $255 million. By quarter, the company expects interest expense to be $64 million to $69 million in the second quarter, $55 million to $60 million in the third quarter, and $55 million to $60 million in the fourth quarter.
 
"We're pleased to complete this more favorable credit structure well ahead of the expiration of our current facility," said Sabrina Simmons, Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Gap Inc. "With our ongoing emphasis on cash management and our improved business performance, we're confident that we have ample cash on hand to secure the new letter of credit facility, while also maintaining sufficient reserves for other business purposes. These new agreements lower our interest expense and increase our financial flexibility."
