Guidance on Fourth Quarter Earnings
 
The company expects to report fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.36 to $0.37. This range includes combined costs of about $0.02 per share related to debt repurchase during the quarter and the company's decision to exit Germany. The company has reduced its outstanding debt by about $140 million through open market repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2003.
In a separate release issued today, Gap Inc. announced its plans to sell its Gap brand operations in Germany, effectively exiting the market as of Aug. 1, 2004. The company said its decision to exit its wholly owned operations in Germany is part of a strategic move to focus resources on stronger international growth opportunities. The German market represents the company's smallest international business and, with only 10 store locations, accounts for well under 1 percent of total company sales.
 
As of Jan. 31, 2004, Gap Inc. operated 4,147 store concepts compared with 4,252 store concepts last year. The number of stores by location totaled 3,022 compared with 3,117 stores by location last year.
