"Although sales of summer product at Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy were strong in May, June's soft traffic trends continued into July, making summer clearance results disappointing overall," said Sabrina Simmons, Senior Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. "Due to markdowns needed to clear summer product, total company merchandise margins in July were slightly below last year. However, we expect to report a solid year-over-year gain in merchandise margins for the second quarter."

For the thirteen weeks ended July 31, 2004, net sales of $3.72 billion represent an increase of 1 percent compared with net sales of $3.69 billion for the same period ended August 2, 2003.
