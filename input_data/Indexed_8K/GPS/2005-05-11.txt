Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On May 6, 2005, we entered into separate $125 million 3-Year Letter of Credit Agreements and $100 million 364-Day Letter of Credit Agreements (collectively, the "") with each of Citibank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank. The New LC Agreements replace the existing Letter of Credit Agreements, dated as of June 23, 2003, among the Company and the LC Subsidiaries named therein on the one hand and each of Citibank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank on the other hand (as amended, the ""), respectively. All letters of credit outstanding under the Existing LC Agreements are now deemed and will be treated as if issued under the New LC Agreements.
New LC Agreements
Existing LC Agreements
 
Unlike the Existing LC Agreements, the New LC Agreements are unsecured. However, the New LC Agreements contain financial and other covenants substantially similar to those included in our $750 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility dated August 30, 2004, including, but not limited to, limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratiosa fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. A violation of these covenants could result in a default under the New LC Agreements, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to request letters of credit and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit. In addition, such a default could, under certain circumstances, permit the holders of our outstanding unsecured debt to accelerate payment of such obligations.

If the forms provided by the LC Issuer at the time the LC Issuer first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a withholding tax (including, without limitation, United States interest withholding) tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from "Taxes" unless and until the LC Issuer provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such forms; , that, if at the date of any assignment pursuant to Section 8.07 hereof, the LC Issuer assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of this Section 3.02 in respect of withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includible in Taxes) withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the assignee on such date.

Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of the LC Issuer to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige the LC Issuer to claim any tax credit or to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or require the LC Issuer to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled.

If the forms provided by the LC Issuer at the time the LC Issuer first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a withholding tax (including, without limitation, United States interest withholding) tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from "Taxes" unless and until the LC Issuer provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such forms; , that, if at the date of any assignment pursuant to Section 8.07 hereof, the LC Issuer assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of this Section 3.02 in respect of withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includible in Taxes) withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the assignee on such date.

Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of the LC Issuer to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige the LC Issuer to claim any tax credit or to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or require the LC Issuer to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled.

If the forms provided by the LC Issuer at the time the LC Issuer first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a withholding tax (including, without limitation, United States interest withholding) tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from "Taxes" unless and until the LC Issuer provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such forms; , that, if at the date of any assignment pursuant to Section 8.07 hereof, the LC Issuer assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of this Section 3.02 in respect of withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includible in Taxes) withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the assignee on such date.

other
than
 
not be entitled to indemnification, and for purposes of clarification, neither the Company nor any LC Subsidiary shall be required to increase any amounts payable to the LC Issuer under Sections 3.02(a) or 3.02(c) hereof with respect to Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the United States); , , that should the LC Issuer become subject to Taxes or Other Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Company shall take such steps as the LC Issuer shall reasonably request to assist the LC Issuer to recover such Taxes or Other Taxes.

Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of the LC Issuer to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige the LC Issuer to claim any tax credit or to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof or require the LC Issuer to do anything that would prejudice its ability to benefit from any other credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments to which it may be entitled.
 
(h) The LC Issuer agrees with the Company that it will take all reasonable actions by all usual means (i) to secure and maintain the benefit of all benefits available to it under the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty concluded by the United States of America to which it may be entitled by reason of the location of the LC Issuer's Applicable Issuing Office or place of incorporation or its status as an enterprise of any jurisdiction having any such applicable double tax treaty, if such benefit would reduce the amount payable by the Company or any LC Subsidiary in accordance with this Section 3.02 and (ii) otherwise to cooperate with the Company to minimize the amount payable by the Company or any LC Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 3.02; , ,
provided
however
