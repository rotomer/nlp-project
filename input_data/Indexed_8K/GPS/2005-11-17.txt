SAN FRANCISCO  November 17, 2005 
 
Third quarter net sales were $3.9 billion, compared with $4.0 billion for the same period last year. Comparable store sales decreased 7 percent, compared with a decrease of 1 percent in the third quarter of the prior year.
 
"Our third quarter results were unacceptable," said Gap Inc. CEO and President Paul Pressler. "However, the issues we face today are fixable and we are aggressively executing plans to provide more compelling product and exceptional store experiences for our customers."

The following table represents the company's third quarter comparable store sales and net sales by division:
 
 
Additional Results and 2005 Outlook
 
Earnings
 
Month-to-date traffic trends have continued to deteriorate beyond anticipated levels. As a result, the performance of the first holiday flows is below expectations. Therefore, the company revised its guidance for fiscal year 2005 earnings per share to $1.12 to $1.17, down from $1.30 to $1.34.
 
Cash and Debt
 
The company ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and investments, of which $75 million was restricted. This represents $1.8 billion more in cash and investments than funded debt. For the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2005, free cash flow was an outflow of $120 million, compared with an inflow of $156 million last year. The company now expects to generate $800 million to $900 million in free cash flow, down from its previous guidance of at least $1 billion in fiscal 2005. Please see the reconciliation of free cash flow to the GAAP financial measure in the table at the end of this release.
Share Repurchases
 
During the third quarter, the company repurchased 9.9 million shares for $188 million. Since October 2004, the company has utilized $2.7 billion to repurchase 129 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, the company's outstanding shares were 872 million.
 
Dividend
 
The company declared a dividend during the third quarter, doubling the prior year amount from $0.0222 to $0.045 per share.
 
Margins
 
Gross margins declined 4.0 points in the third quarter compared to the prior year, due primarily to increased promotions and markdown driven by disappointing customer response to fall product. The operating margin for the third quarter was 8.8 percent compared with 11.5 percent for the same period last year. The company now expects full year 2005 operating margins of about 10 to 10.5 percent, down from its previous guidance of about 11.5 percent.
 
Inventory
 
Gap Inc. reported that inventory per square foot was down 7 percent at the end of the third quarter as compared to a 1 percent increase in the third quarter of the prior year. Inventory per square foot at the end of the fourth quarter is still expected to be flat, compared with a 6 percent increase last year. Inventory per square foot at the end of the first quarter 2006 is expected to be down in the low single digits, compared with a 5 percent increase in the first quarter of the prior year.
 
Interest Expense
 
The company now expects full year 2005 gross interest expense to be about $50 million, down from its previous guidance of about $55 million.
 
Depreciation and Amortization
 
Gap Inc. reiterated that it expects depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year 2005 to be about $550 million.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
Fiscal year to date capital expenditures were approximately $448 million compared with $294 million last year. The company reiterated that it expects its full-year 2005 capital spending to be about $625 million.
 
Effective Tax Rate
 
The company's tax rate for the third quarter 2005 was 39.6 percent. The effective tax rate is still expected to be 38 percent to 39 percent for fiscal 2005.
 
Real Estate
 
Through October 29, 2005, the company opened 99 store locations and closed 11. Net square footage for the third quarter increased 3 percent compared to the same period last year. For fiscal 2005, the company now expects to open about 195 store locations, up from its previous guidance of 190, weighted toward Old Navy. Furthermore, the company now expects to close about 145 store locations, up from its previous guidance of 140, weighted toward Gap North America.
