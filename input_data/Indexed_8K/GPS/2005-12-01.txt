Forward-Looking Statements
 
This press release and related recorded call contain forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "plan," and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, without limitations, statements regarding inventory per square foot for the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: the risk that the Company will be unsuccessful in gauging fashion trends and changing consumer preferences; the highly competitive nature of the Company's business in the U.S. and internationally and its dependence on consumer spending patterns, which are influenced by numerous other factors; the risk that the Company will be unsuccessful in identifying and negotiating new store locations effectively; the risk that comparable store sales and margins will
experience fluctuations; the risk that the Company will be unsuccessful in implementing its strategic, operating and people initiatives; the risk that adverse changes in the Company's credit ratings may have a negative impact on its financing costs and structure in future periods; the risk that trade matters, events causing disruptions in product shipments from China and other foreign countries, or IT systems changes may disrupt the Company's supply chain or operations; and the risk that the Company will not be successful in defending various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, claims, and audits; any of which could impact net sales, costs and expenses, and/or planned strategies. Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. Readers should also consult the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended October 29, 2005.
 
Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact net sales and profitability are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of December 1, 2005, and the Company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.
