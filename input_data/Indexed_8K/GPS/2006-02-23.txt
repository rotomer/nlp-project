SAN FRANCISCO  February 23, 2006 
 
"Despite challenges in 2005, we delivered on our growth initiatives, and our strong cash flow enabled us to significantly increase our dividend and repurchase shares," said Gap Inc.

Additional Results and 2006 Outlook
 
Earnings
 
The company's fiscal year 2005 earnings per share of $1.24 includes a $0.03 net benefit from a combination of four factors: (1) a $0.04 benefit from the company's decision to occupy its leased office space in the Mission Bay area of San Francisco; (2) a $0.01 benefit from a non-recurring final adjustment to lease accounting; and (3) a benefit of $0.01 from a lower effective tax rate driven primarily by a non-recurring tax benefit realized in the fourth quarter. (4) These benefits were partially offset by $0.03 of amortization related to lease rights for stores in France.
 
Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of its turnaround, the fact that month-to-date traffic is down 13 percent in February, and the company's expectation that total comparable store sales will remain negative in the first half of fiscal year 2006 and turn modestly positive in the second half of fiscal year 2006, the company is guiding to a modest fiscal year 2006 earnings per share of $1.23 to $1.27. This outlook includes expenses related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 123R, "Share-Based Payment" in fiscal year 2006, which the company estimates to be about $45 million of pre-tax expense, or approximately $0.03 per share in 2006.
 
Cash and Debt
 
After repurchasing 98.5 million shares for $2 billion during the year, the company ended the fourth quarter with $3.0 billion in cash and short-term investments. Fiscal year 2005 free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchase of property and equipment, was an inflow of $951 million. The company expects to generate at least $900 million in free cash flow for fiscal year 2006. Please see the reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP financial measure in the table at the end of this release.
 
Share Repurchases and Dividend
 
In a separate release today, the company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an additional $500 million for its share repurchase program, effective immediately. The company expects to repurchase $250 million of this authorization within the first half of fiscal year 2006. Since 2004, the company has completed $3 billion of share repurchases for about 146 million shares.
 
The company and its Board of Directors intend to significantly increase the annual dividend per share from $0.18 in fiscal year 2005 to $0.32 for fiscal year 2006. The dividend is expected to be paid quarterly in late April, July, October and January.
 
Margins
 
Product promotions and markdowns contributed to a 260 basis point decline in gross margin for fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004. Gross margin for fiscal year 2005 was 36.6 percent. Operating margin for fiscal year 2005 was 10.9 percent. Operating margin for fiscal year 2006 is expected to be 10.0 to 10.5 percent.
 
Inventory
 
The company reported that year over year inventory per square foot decreased 11 percent at the end of the fourth quarter. The company expects the percent decrease in inventory per square foot at the end of the first quarter of 2006 to be down in the low single digits, versus a 5 percent increase last year. The percent decrease in inventory per square foot at the end of the second quarter of 2006 is expected to be down in the low single digits versus a 3 percent decrease for the same period last year.
 
Interest Expense

Capital Expenditures and Effective Tax Rate

All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "plan," and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding: (i) earnings per share for fiscal year 2006; (ii) incremental stock option expense for fiscal year 2006; (iii) comparable store sales for fiscal year 2006; (iv) free cash flow for fiscal year 2006; (v) share repurchases in the first half of fiscal year 2006; (vi) dividend amounts and timing in fiscal year 2006; (vii) operating margin for fiscal year 2006; (viii) year over year change in inventory per square foot at the end of the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2006; (ix) gross interest expense for fiscal year 2006; (x) depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2006; (xi) capital expenditures for fiscal year 2006; (xii) effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006; (xiii) store openings and closings, and weightings by brand, for fiscal year 2006; (xiv) real estate square footage for fiscal year 2006; and (xv) real estate expansion, international expansion, brand extensions and creating new brands.
 
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: the risk that adjustments to the company's unaudited financial statements may be identified through the course of the company's independent registered public accounting firm completing its integrated audit of the company's financial statements and financial controls; the risk that subsequent events may occur that require adjustments to the company's unaudited financial statements; the risk that the adoption of new accounting pronouncements will impact future results such as the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R in fiscal 2006 on the effective tax rate; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in gauging fashion trends and changing consumer preferences; the highly competitive nature of the company's business in the U.S. and internationally and its dependence on consumer spending patterns, which are influenced by numerous other factors; the risk that comparable store sales and margins will experience fluctuations; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in implementing its strategic and operating initiatives; the risk that adverse changes in the company's credit ratings may have a negative impact on its financing costs and structure in future periods; the risk that trade matters, events causing disruptions in product shipments from China and other foreign countries, or IT systems changes may disrupt the company's supply chain or operations; and the risk that the company will not be successful in defending various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, claims, and audits; any of which could impact net sales, costs and expenses, and/or planned strategies. Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be found in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. Readers should also consult the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 29, 2005.
 
Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact net sales and profitability are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of February 23, 2006 and the company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.
