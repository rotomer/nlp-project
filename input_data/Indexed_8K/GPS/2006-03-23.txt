Grant No.
            
The Gap, Inc. (the "Company") hereby grants to (the "Employee"), a stock option under The Gap, Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), to purchase shares of common stock of the Company, $0.05 par value ("Shares"). This option is subject to all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, including the terms and conditions contained in the attached Appendix A. The date of this Agreement is. Subject to the provisions of Appendix A and of the Plan, the principal features of this option are as follows:
                    
                    
 
As provided in the Plan and in this Agreement, this option may terminate before the date written above, including before the option becomes exercisable or is exercised. For example, if Employee's employment ends before the date this option becomes exercisable, this option will terminate at the same time as Employee's employment terminates. See paragraphs 5 and 6 of Appendix A for further information concerning how changes in employment affect termination of this option. PLEASE BE SURE TO READ ALL OF APPENDIX A, WHICH CONTAINS THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS OPTION.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Employee have executed this Agreement, in duplicate, to be effective as of the date first above written.
 
My signature below indicates that I understand that this Option is 1) subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the attached Appendix A) and of the Plan, 2) not considered salary, nor is it a promise for future grants of Stock Options, 3) not a term or condition of my employment with the Company, and 4) made at the sole discretion of the Company.
 
 
1. . The Company hereby grants to Employee under the Plan, as a separate incentive in connection with his or her employment and not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for his or her services, a non-qualified stock option to purchase, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan, all or any part of the number of Shares set forth on page 1 of this Agreement. The option granted hereby is not intended to be an Incentive Stock Option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
Grant of Option
2. . The purchase price per Share (the "Option Price") shall be equal to the price set forth on page 1 of this Agreement. The Option Price shall be payable in the legal tender of the United States.
Exercise Price
3. . The number and class of Shares specified in paragraph 1 above, and/or the Option Price, are subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of changes in the capital stock of the Company by reason of stock dividends, split-ups or combinations of shares, reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, reorganizations or liquidations. Subject to any required action of the stockholders of the Company, if the Company shall be the surviving corporation in any merger or consolidation, the option granted hereunder (to the extent that it is still outstanding) shall pertain to and apply to the securities to which a holder of the same number of Shares that are then subject to the option would have been entitled. To the extent that the foregoing adjustments relate to stock or securities of the Company, such adjustments shall be made by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Committee"), whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
Number of Shares
4. . Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the right to exercise the option awarded by this Agreement shall accrue as set forth on page 1 of this Agreement, assuming that Employee is still employed with the Company or an Affiliate through such date(s). If Employee is not employed on such date(s), the option shall terminate, as set out in paragraph 6.
Commencement of Exercisability
5. . Notwithstanding paragraph 4 or any other provision of this Agreement, prior to the date this option is scheduled to become exercisable, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that the right to exercise the option awarded by this Agreement shall accrue on a date later than such date. The Committee shall exercise its power to postpone the commencement of exercisability only if the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that Employee has taken a personal leave of absence (as defined from time to time by the Committee) since the date of this Agreement. The duration of the period of postponement shall equal the duration of the personal leave of absence. If Employee does not return from the personal leave of absence, the option shall terminate as set out in paragraph 6.
Postponement of Exercisability
6. . In the event that Employee's employment with the Company or an Affiliate terminates for any reason other than Retirement (as defined in the Plan) or death, this option shall immediately thereupon terminate, except that Employee shall have three (3) months from such termination to exercise any unexercised portion of the option which is then exercisable. In the event of Employee's Retirement, Employee may, within one (1) year after the date of such Retirement, or within ten (10) years from the date of this Agreement, whichever shall first occur, exercise any unexercised portion of the option (whether or not exercisable). In the event that Employee shall die while in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate, any unexercised portion of the option (whether or not exercisable) may be exercised by Employee's beneficiary or transferee, as hereinafter provided, for a period of one (1) year after the date of Employee's death or within ten (10) years from the date of this Agreement, whichever shall first occur. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, in the event that within one year of the date of this Agreement, Employee dies or terminates employment due to Retirement, this option shall immediately thereupon terminate.
Termination of Option
7. . The option shall be exercisable during Employee's lifetime only by Employee. The option shall be non-transferable by Employee other than by a beneficiary designation made in a form and manner acceptable to the Committee, or by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
Persons Eligible to Exercise
8. . To the extent exercisable after Employee's death, the option shall be exercised only by Employee's designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, or if no beneficiary survives Employee, by the person or persons entitled to the option under Employee's will, or if Employee shall fail to make testamentary disposition of the option, his or her legal representative. Any transferee exercising the option must furnish the Company (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer of the option and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer, and (c) written acceptance of the terms and conditions of the option as prescribed in this Agreement.
Death of Employee
9. . The option may be exercised by the person then entitled to do so as to any Shares which may then be purchased (a) by giving written notice of exercise to the Company, specifying the number of full Shares to be purchased and accompanied by full payment of the purchase price thereof (and the amount of any income tax the Company determines is required to be withheld by reason of such exercise), and (b) by giving satisfactory assurances in writing if requested by the Company, signed by the person exercising the option, that the Shares to be purchased upon such exercise are being purchased for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof.
Exercise of Option
10. . Neither Employee nor any person claiming under or through said Employee shall be or have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any of the Shares issuable upon the exercise of the option, unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to Employee.
No Rights of Stockholder
11. . Employee understands and agrees that this Agreement does not impact in any way the right of the Company, or the Affiliate employing Employee, as the case may be, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. Employee understands and agrees that his or her employment is "at-will" and that either the Company or Employee may terminate Employee's employment at any time and for any reason. Employee also understands and agrees that his or her "at-will" status can only be changed by an express written contract signed by an authorized officer of the Company and Employee.

Agreement Severable

Exhibit 10.2
Award No.
            
The Gap, Inc. (the "Company") hereby grants to (the "Employee"), an award (the "Award") of Performance Units (each Performance Unit shall be referred to as a "Stock Award") which represent the right to receive shares of the Company's common stock, $0.05 par value (the "Shares") subject to the fulfillment of the vesting conditions and other conditions set forth in the attached Appendix A. This Award is granted pursuant to The Gap, Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and is subject to all of the terms and conditions contained in this Stock Award Agreement (the "Agreement"), including the terms and conditions contained in the attached Appendix A. The date of this Agreement is . Subject to the provisions of Appendix A and of the Plan, the principal features of this Award are as follows:
                    
                    
 
As provided in the Plan and in this Agreement, this Award may terminate before the scheduled vest date(s) of the Stock Awards. For example, if Employee's employment ends before the date this Award vests, this Award will terminate at the same time as such termination. Important additional information on vesting and forfeiture of the Stock Awards covered by this Award including those due to changes in employment is contained in paragraphs 3 through 5 of Appendix A.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Employee have executed this Agreement, in duplicate, to be effective as of the date first above written.
 
My signature below indicates that I understand that this Award is 1) subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the attached Appendix A) and of the Plan, 2) not considered salary, nor is it a promise for future grants of Stock Awards, 3) not a term or condition of my employment with the Company, and 4) made at the sole discretion of the Company.
 
 
1. . The Company hereby grants to the Employee as a separate incentive in connection with his or her employment and not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for his or her services, an Award with respect to the number of Stock Awards set forth on page 1 of this Agreement, subject to all the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Plan. Employee understands and agrees that this Award does not guarantee any future Stock Award grants and that grants are made at the sole discretion of the Company.
Grant of Stock Awards
2. . On any date, a Stock Award has a value equal to the Fair Market Value of one Share. Unless and until a Stock Award has vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement, the Employee will have no right to payment of a Share with respect to the Stock Award. Prior to actual payment of any Shares pursuant to vested Stock Awards, each Stock Award represents an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
Company's Obligation to Pay
3. . Subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, the Stock Awards subject to this Agreement will vest as to the number of Stock Awards, and on the dates shown, on the first page of this Agreement (each a "Vesting Date"), but in each case, only if the Employee has been continuously employed by the Company or by one of its Affiliates from the date of this Award until the applicable Vesting Date of the Stock Awards. If Employee is not employed on such date(s), the Award shall terminate, as set forth in paragraph 5. Upon each Vesting Date, one Share shall be issued for each Stock Award that vests on such Vesting Date, subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. No fractional Shares shall be issued under this Agreement.
Vesting of Stock Awards and Issuance of Shares
4. . In the event of the Employee's death or Retirement (as defined in the Plan), the remaining Stock Awards shall become fully vested on the date of death or Retirement, as applicable. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if in the event that within one year of the date of this Agreement, Employee dies or terminates employment due to Retirement, this Stock Award shall immediately thereupon terminate.
Death or Retirement
5. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the balance of the Stock Awards that have not vested pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4 will be forfeited and cancelled automatically at the time of the Employee's Termination of Service.
Termination of Service.
6. . On each Vesting Date, the Employee agrees that the Company will withhold a portion of the Shares scheduled to be issued pursuant to vested Stock Awards that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay the federal, state and local income, employment and any other applicable taxes required to be withheld by the Company or its designated Affiliate. The Company will only withhold whole Shares and therefore the Employee also authorizes deduction without notice from salary or other amounts payable to the Employee of cash in an amount sufficient to satisfy the Company's remaining tax withholding obligation. Notwithstanding the previous two sentences, the Employee, if the Company in its sole discretion so agrees, may elect to furnish to the Company written notice, no more than 30 days and no less than 5 days in advance of a scheduled Vesting Date, of his or her intent to satisfy the tax withholding requirement by remitting the full amount of the tax withholding to the Company on the scheduled Vesting Date. In the event that Employee provides such written notice and fails to satisfy the tax withholding requirement by the Vesting date, the Company shall satisfy the tax withholding requirement pursuant to the first two sentences of this section.
Withholding Taxes
7. . Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Employee under this Agreement will, if the Employee is then deceased, be made to the Employee's designated beneficiary, or if no such beneficiary survives the Employee, the person or persons entitled to such distribution or delivery under the Employee's will or, if the Employee should fail to make testamentary disposition of such property, the executor of his or her estate. In order to be effective, a beneficiary designation must be made by the Employee in a form and manner acceptable to the Company. Any transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer.
Beneficiary Designation
8. . The Shares deliverable to the Employee on the Vesting Date(s) may be either previously authorized but unissued Shares or issued Shares that have been reacquired by the Company. The Company shall not be required to issue any Shares hereunder so long as the Company
Conditions to Issuance of Shares
reasonably anticipates that such issuance will violate Federal securities law or other applicable law; provided however, that in such event the Company shall issue such Shares at the earliest possible date at which the Company reasonably anticipates that the issuance of the shares will not cause such violation. For purposes of the previous sentence, any issuance of Shares that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code shall not be treated as a violation of applicable law.
9. . Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Stock Award unless and until Shares have been issued in accordance with paragraph 3, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee. Except as provided in paragraph 10, after such issuance, recordation, and delivery, the Employee will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.
Rights as Stockholder
10. . In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock dividend, split-up, Share combination, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the Committee shall adjust the Stock Awards subject to the Award, in such manner as the Committee (in its sole discretion) shall determine to be appropriate.
Changes in Stock
11. . This Agreement is subject to all the terms and provisions of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern. Terms used in this Agreement that are not defined in this Agreement will have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
Plan Governs
12. . The Committee will have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any portion of the Stock Award has vested). All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee in good faith will be final and binding upon the Employee, the Company and all other interested persons. No member of the Committee will be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement.
Committee Authority
13. . The Employee understands and agrees that this Agreement does not impact in any way the right of the Company, or the Affiliate employing the Employee, as the case may be, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. The Employee understands and agrees that his or her employment is "at-will" and that either the Company or the Employee may terminate the Employee's employment at any time and for any reason. The Employee also understands and agrees that his or her "at-will" status can only be changed by an express written contract signed by an authorized officer of the Company and the Employee.
No Modification of At-Will Status
14. . Except as otherwise herein provided, the Stock Awards herein granted and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of such Stock Award, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, contrary to the provisions hereof, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process upon the rights and privileges conferred hereby, such Stock Award and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will immediately become null and void.
Non-Transferability of Award

Exhibit 10.4
Award No.
            
The Gap, Inc. (the "Company") hereby grants to (the "Employee"), an award (the "Award") of Performance Units (each Performance Unit shall be referred to as a "Stock Award") which represent the right to receive shares of the Company's common stock, $0.05 par value (the "Shares") subject to the fulfillment of the vesting conditions and other conditions set forth in the attached Appendix A. This Award is granted pursuant to The Gap, Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and is subject to all of the terms and conditions contained in this Stock Award Agreement (the "Agreement"), including the terms and conditions contained in the attached Appendix A. The date of this Agreement is . Subject to the provisions of Appendix A and of the Plan, the principal features of this Award are as follows:
                    
                    
 
As provided in the Plan and in this Agreement, this Award may terminate before the scheduled vest date(s) of the Stock Awards. For example, if Employee's employment as Chief Executive Officer ends before the date this Award vests, this Award will terminate at the same time as such termination. Important additional information on vesting and forfeiture of the Stock Awards covered by this Award including those due to changes in employment is contained in paragraphs 3 through 5 of Appendix A.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Employee have executed this Agreement, in duplicate, to be effective as of the date first above written.
 
My signature below indicates that I understand that this Award is 1) subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the attached Appendix A) and of the Plan, 2) not considered salary, nor is it a promise for future grants of Stock Awards, 3) not a term or condition of my employment with the Company, and 4) made at the sole discretion of the Company.
 
 
1. . The Company hereby grants to the Employee as a separate incentive in connection with his or her employment and not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for his or her services, an Award with respect to the number of Stock Awards set forth on page 1 of this Agreement, subject to all the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the Plan. Employee understands and agrees that this Award does not guarantee any future Stock Award grants and that grants are made at the sole discretion of the Company.
Grant of Stock Awards
2. . On any date, a Stock Award has a value equal to the Fair Market Value of one Share. Unless and until a Stock Award has vested in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement, the Employee will have no right to payment of a Share with respect to the Stock Award. Prior to actual payment of any Shares pursuant to vested Stock Awards, each Stock Award represents an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
Company's Obligation to Pay
3. . Subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, the Stock Awards subject to this Agreement will vest as to the number of Stock Awards, and on the dates shown, on the first page of this Agreement (each a "Vesting Date"), but in each case, only if the Employee has been continuously employed as the Chief Executive Officer by the Company or by one of its Affiliates from the date of this Award until the applicable Vesting Date of the Stock Awards. If Employee is not employed as the Chief Executive Officer on such date(s), the Award shall terminate, as set forth in paragraph 5. Upon each Vesting Date, one Share shall be issued for each Stock Award that vests on such Vesting Date, subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement. No fractional Shares shall be issued under this Agreement.
Vesting of Stock Awards and Issuance of Shares
4. . In the event of the Employee's death or Retirement (as defined in the Plan), the remaining Stock Awards shall become fully vested on the date of death or Retirement, as applicable. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if in the event that within one year of the date of this Agreement, Employee dies or terminates employment due to Retirement, this Stock Award shall immediately thereupon terminate.
Death or Retirement
5. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the balance of the Stock Awards that have not vested pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4 will be forfeited and cancelled automatically at the time of the Employee's Termination of Service as Chief Executive Officer.
Termination of Service.
6. . On each Vesting Date, the Employee agrees that the Company will withhold a portion of the Shares scheduled to be issued pursuant to vested Stock Awards that have an aggregate market value sufficient to pay the federal, state and local income, employment and any other applicable taxes required to be withheld by the Company or its designated Affiliate. The Company will only withhold whole Shares and therefore the Employee also authorizes deduction without notice from salary or other amounts payable to the Employee of cash in an amount sufficient to satisfy the Company's remaining tax withholding obligation. Notwithstanding the previous two sentences, the Employee, if the Company in its sole discretion so agrees, may elect to furnish to the Company written notice, no more than 30 days and no less than 5 days in advance of a scheduled Vesting Date, of his or her intent to satisfy the tax withholding requirement by remitting the full amount of the tax withholding to the Company on the scheduled Vesting Date. In the event that Employee provides such written notice and fails to satisfy the tax withholding requirement by the Vesting date, the Company shall satisfy the tax withholding requirement pursuant to the first two sentences of this section.
Withholding Taxes
7. . Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Employee under this Agreement will, if the Employee is then deceased, be made to the Employee's designated beneficiary, or if no such beneficiary survives the Employee, the person or persons entitled to such distribution or delivery under the Employee's will or, if the Employee should fail to make testamentary disposition of such property, the executor of his or her estate. In order to be effective, a beneficiary designation must be made by the Employee in a form and manner acceptable to the Company. Any transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer.
Beneficiary Designation
8. . The Shares deliverable to the Employee on the Vesting Date(s) may be either previously authorized but unissued Shares or issued Shares that have been reacquired by the Company. The Company shall not be required to issue any Shares hereunder so long as the Company
Conditions to Issuance of Shares
reasonably anticipates that such issuance will violate Federal securities law or other applicable law; provided however, that in such event the Company shall issue such Shares at the earliest possible date at which the Company reasonably anticipates that the issuance of the shares will not cause such violation. For purposes of the previous sentence, any issuance of Shares that would cause inclusion in gross income or the application of any penalty provision or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code shall not be treated as a violation of applicable law.
9. . Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through the Employee will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Stock Award unless and until Shares have been issued in accordance with paragraph 3, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Employee. Except as provided in paragraph 10, after such issuance, recordation, and delivery, the Employee will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.
Rights as Stockholder
10. . In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, separation, liquidation, stock dividend, split-up, Share combination, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares, the Committee shall adjust the Stock Awards subject to the Award, in such manner as the Committee (in its sole discretion) shall determine to be appropriate.
Changes in Stock
11. . This Agreement is subject to all the terms and provisions of the Plan. In the event of a conflict between one or more provisions of this Agreement and one or more provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan will govern. Terms used in this Agreement that are not defined in this Agreement will have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
Plan Governs
12. . The Committee will have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any portion of the Stock Award has vested). All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee in good faith will be final and binding upon the Employee, the Company and all other interested persons. No member of the Committee will be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement.
Committee Authority
13. . The Employee understands and agrees that this Agreement does not impact in any way the right of the Company, or the Affiliate employing the Employee, as the case may be, to terminate or change the terms of the employment of the Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause. The Employee understands and agrees that his or her employment is "at-will" and that either the Company or the Employee may terminate the Employee's employment at any time and for any reason. The Employee also understands and agrees that his or her "at-will" status can only be changed by an express written contract signed by an authorized officer of the Company and the Employee.
No Modification of At-Will Status
14. . Except as otherwise herein provided, the Stock Awards herein granted and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and will not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of such Stock Award, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, contrary to the provisions hereof, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process upon the rights and privileges conferred hereby, such Stock Award and the rights and privileges conferred hereby will immediately become null and void.
Non-Transferability of Award

1. . The Company hereby grants to the Director under the Plan the number of Stock Units indicated on the first page of this Agreement subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan.
Grant of Stock Units
2. . On any date, a Stock Unit has a value equal to the Fair Market Value of one Share. Unless and until the Stock Units have vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth on the first page of this Agreement, the Director will have no right to payment of the Stock Units. Prior to actual payment of any vested Stock Units, Stock Units represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
Company's Obligation to Pay
3. .
Payment
(a) Vested Stock Units will be paid to the Director in full Shares (with the balance, if any, in cash) as soon as practicable following the date which is three (3) years from the date of vesting, subject to paragraph 5.
General Rule.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph 3(a), at the discretion of the Committee and in accordance with the Plan and such rules established by the Committee, the Director may elect to further defer delivery of the proceeds due with respect to his or her vested Stock Units by properly completing and submitting a Stock Unit Deferral Election Form (the "Election Form") to the Company in accordance with the directions on the Election Form and the procedures established by the Committee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), any vested Stock Units that become payable as a result of the Director's Termination of Service will be paid to the Director (or in the event of the Director's death, to his or her estate) no earlier than six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of the Director's Termination of Service, subject to paragraph 5.
Termination of Service.
4. . Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Director under this Agreement will, if the Director is then deceased, be made to the Director's designated beneficiary.

Notwithstanding the previous two sentences, the Director, if the Company in its sole discretion so agrees, may elect to furnish to the Company written notice, no more than 30 days and no less than 5 days in advance of the date the vested Stock Units are scheduled to be paid (in accordance with Paragraph 3), of his or her intent to satisfy the tax withholding requirement by remitting the full amount of the tax withholding to the Company on this date.

Withholding of Taxes

Rights as Stockholder
the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Director. After such issuance, recordation, and delivery, the Director will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to such Shares.

Notice of Governing Law
Complete and return this Election Form if you want to defer the settlement (payment) of stock units granted to you under The Gap, Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan").
Stock units that are granted to you under the Plan ("Stock Units") generally become payable as soon as practicable after the date which is three (3) years from the date of vesting (the "Original Payment Date") in whole shares of common stock of The Gap, Inc. (the "Company"), with the balance, if any, in cash. Stock Units are immediately one hundred percent (100%) vested upon the Date of Grant. The Committee (as defined in the Plan) permits you to defer the settlement of your Stock Units beyond the Original Payment Date on a tax-deferred basis in accordance with the terms of the Plan. To achieve this favorable tax result, the amounts deferred will represent an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay on behalf of the Company. With respect to any amounts that you defer, you will become a general, unsecured creditor of the Company, which means that your deferral remains subject to the claims of the Company's creditors, and, if the Company's assets are insufficient to pay all of its creditors, you may not receive part or all of your deferral.
Please note that the Plan has been amended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 409A"). As a result, any deferral elections made with respect to Stock Units must comply with the requirements of Section 409A. This means that deferral elections can be accepted and become effective the following requirements (the "Deferral Requirements") are satisfied: (a) the deferral election must be made at least twelve (12) months before the Original Payment Date; (b) the deferral election must defer the payment of the Stock Units for a period of not less than five (5) years from the Original Payment Date; and (c) the deferral election may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the election is made.

Payment of the Stock Units indicated in Section II above will be made as soon as practicable following the date you choose below (the "Designated Payment Date"), provided that the Deferral Requirements are satisfied. This means that your Designated Payment Date will be given effect only if (a) you complete and return this Election Form at least twelve (12) months before the Original Payment Date, and (b) the Designated Payment Date is at least five (5) years from the Original Payment Date.

(must be at least five (5) years from Original Payment Date of the Stock Units)
Please note that if the Original Payment Date is within twelve (12) months of the date you complete and return this Election Form, then due to Section 409A requirements, we cannot accept your deferral election and it will be deemed null and void. This means that payment of the Stock Units will be made as soon as practicable after the Original Payment Date regardless of your deferral election.
IMPORTANT:
Any amounts deferred will be taxable as ordinary income in the year paid. Please seek advice from your professional tax advisor before making your deferral election.
IV. DIRECTOR SIGNATURE
I acknowledge that I have read and reviewed a copy of the Plan's prospectus. I understand that my decision to defer the settlement of Stock Units will make me only a general, unsecured creditor of the Company. I also understand that the amounts deferred will be taxable as ordinary income in the year paid. If the Company determines that it is required to withhold for any taxes, including, but not limited to, income or employment taxes, prior to the date of deferred payout, I agree that, if I do not make other arrangements that are satisfactory to the Committee, in its sole discretion, the Company will withhold from the amounts due to me. I also understand that, upon receipt of deferred payouts, in addition to federal taxes, I may owe taxes both (1) to the state where I resided at the time of making this election and, if different, (2) to the state where I reside when I receive a deferred payout.
The Committee shall have the discretion to make all determinations and decisions regarding this deferral election. To the extent the Committee determines that this election does not comply with applicable laws, now or in the future, this election shall be null and void. In such an event, amounts deferred shall be settled (1) immediately if the Original Payment Date already has occurred, or (2) upon the Original Payment Date if in the future.
By signing this Election Form, I authorize implementation of the above instructions. I understand that the deferral elections that I have made on this Election Form are generally irrevocable and may not be changed in the future except in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A and the procedures specified by the Committee.
 
Agreed to and accepted:
 
 

Exhibit 10.6
The Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") has made the following changes to its compensation arrangements for members of the Board who are not also employed by the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any of its affiliated entities (a "Nonemployee Director"); provided, however, that these changes shall only become effective if and when the Company's stockholders approve of the proposed amendment and restatement of the Company's 1996 Stock Option and Award Plan (thereafter to be known as the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan")); and, provided further, that the Board retains its right to make further changes to this compensation arrangement from time-to-time in whole or in the case of individual Nonemployee Director participants:
1. .

Elimination of Current Arrangement
2. . Each individual who first becomes a Nonemployee Director on or after the date of the Company's 2006 annual meeting of stockholders shall be granted Stock Units under the Company's 2006 Plan, with an initial value of $100,000, on the date that he or she first is appointed or elected to the Board; provide that if he or she first is elected to the Board at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders, such grant shall be made on the first business day after such annual meeting of stockholders.
New Nonemployee Directors
3. . Each Nonemployee Director serving as such immediately prior to the Company's 2006 annual meeting of stockholders shall be granted Stock Units under the 2006 Plan, with an initial value of $100,000, on the first business day after such annual meeting, provided he or she is a Nonemployee Director on that date. Thereafter, each Nonemployee Director shall be granted Stock Units under the 2006 Plan, with an initial value of $100,000, on the first business day after each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders of the Company, provided that he or she both (a) is a Nonemployee Director on that date, and (b) has continuously served as such since the preceding grant under Section 2 or 3, as the case may be.
Continuing Nonemployee Directors
