Exhibit 99.1
Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today reported net sales of $1.23 billion for the four-week period ended April 29, 2006, which is flat to net sales of $1.23 billion for the same period ended April 30, 2005. The company's comparable store sales for April 2006 decreased 3 percent compared with a 5 percent decrease in April 2005.
SAN FRANCISCO  May 4, 2006 
Comparable store sales by division for April 2006 were as follows:
Gap North America: negative 2 percent versus negative 9 percent last year
Banana Republic North America: positive 1 percent versus negative 6 percent last year
Old Navy North America: negative 6 percent versus flat last year
International: negative 3 percent versus negative 12 percent last year
"April comparable store sales improved relative to March, reflecting the impact of the shift of Easter to April this year," said Sabrina Simmons, Senior Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. "Merchandise margins were above last year, but will likely experience pressure in May as we work through remaining Spring markdowns."

All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "plan," and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding: (i) merchandise margins in May 2006; (ii) earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 and (iii) year-over-year change in inventory per square foot at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2006.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: the risk that additional information may arise from the company's due diligence during the close process or other subsequent events that would require the company to reevaluate its assumptions or make other adjustments; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in gauging fashion trends and changing consumer preferences; the highly competitive nature of the company's business in the U.S. and internationally and its dependence on consumer spending patterns, which are influenced by numerous other factors; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in identifying and negotiating new store locations effectively; the risk that comparable store sales and margins will experience fluctuations; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in implementing its strategic, operating and people initiatives; the risk that adverse changes in the company's credit ratings may have a negative impact on its financing costs and structure in future periods; the risk that trade matters, events causing disruptions in product shipments from China and other foreign countries, or IT systems changes may disrupt the company's supply chain or operations; and the risk that the company will not be successful in defending various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, claims, and audits; any of which could impact net sales, costs and expenses, and/or planned strategies. Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be found in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006.
