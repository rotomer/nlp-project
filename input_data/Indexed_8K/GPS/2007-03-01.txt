Please see the reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP financial measure in the table at the end of this release.
Share Repurchases
After repurchasing about 14 million shares for $279 million during the fourth quarter, the company had utilized about $550 million of its $750 million share repurchase authorization. At the end of the fourth quarter, the company's outstanding shares were 814 million.

Margins
Gross margin for fiscal year 2006 was 35.4 percent and declined 120 basis points compared with fiscal year 2005.

Operating margin for fiscal year 2007 is expected to be in the high single-digits. Please see the financials section on for the company's explanation of numerical range guidance.

Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: the risk that adjustments to the company's unaudited financial statements may be identified through the course of the company's independent registered public accounting firm completing its integrated audit of the company's financial statements and financial controls; the risk that subsequent events may occur that require adjustments to the company's unaudited financial statements; the risk that the adoption of new accounting pronouncements will impact future results; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in gauging fashion trends and changing consumer preferences; the highly competitive nature of the company's business in the U.S. and internationally and its dependence on consumer spending patterns, which are influenced by numerous other factors; the risk that comparable store sales and margins will experience fluctuations; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in implementing its strategic and operating initiatives; the risk that adverse changes in the company's credit ratings may have a negative impact on its financing costs and structure in future periods; the risk that trade matters, events causing disruptions in product shipments from China and other foreign countries, or IT systems changes may disrupt the company's supply chain or operations; and the risk that the company will not be successful in defending various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, claims, and audits; any of which could impact net sales, costs and expenses, and/or planned strategies. Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be found in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006. Readers should also consult the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 28, 2006.
Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact net sales and profitability are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of March 1, 2007 and the company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.
