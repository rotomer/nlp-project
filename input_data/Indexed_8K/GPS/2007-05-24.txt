Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and related conference call and webcast contain unaudited financial information for the first quarter of 2007 and forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "plan," and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding: (i) diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis for fiscal year 2007; (ii) diluted earnings per share excluding Forth & Towne's net loss for fiscal year 2007; (iii) Forth & Towne's expected net loss per share for fiscal year 2007; (iv) effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007; (v) free cash flow for fiscal year 2007; (vi) expected net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2007; (vii) debt repayment in fiscal year 2007; (viii) full year dividends for fiscal year 2007; (ix) operating margin for fiscal year 2007; (x) year-over-year change in inventory per square foot at the end of the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2007; (xi) interest expense for fiscal year 2007; (xii) depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2007; (xiii) capital spending for fiscal year 2007; (xiv) store openings and closings, and weightings by brand, for fiscal year 2007; (xv) increase in real estate square footage for fiscal year 2007; (xvi) Gap brand inventory levels in fiscal year 2007; and (xvii) expected continuous improvements in results at Old Navy throughout fiscal 2007.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: the risk that subsequent events may occur that require adjustments to the company's unaudited financial statements; the risk that the adoption of new accounting pronouncements will impact future results; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in gauging fashion trends and changing consumer preferences; the highly competitive nature of the company's business in the U.S. and internationally and its dependence on consumer spending patterns, which are influenced by numerous other factors; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in identifying and negotiating new store locations effectively; the risk that comparable store sales and margins will experience fluctuations; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in implementing its strategic, operating and people initiatives; the risk that adverse changes in the company's credit ratings may have a negative impact on its financing costs and structure in future periods; the risk that trade matters, events causing disruptions in product shipments from China and other foreign countries, or IT systems changes may disrupt the company's supply chain or operations; and the risk that the company will not be successful in defending various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, claims, and audits; any of which could impact net sales, costs and expenses, and/or planned strategies. Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be found in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2007.
Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact net sales and profitability are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 24, 2007 and the company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.
