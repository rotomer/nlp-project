Exhibit 99.1
Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today reported that net earnings for the second quarter, which ended August 4, 2007, increased 19 percent to $152 million, or $0.19 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $128 million, or $0.15 per share on a diluted basis, for the second quarter of last year.
SAN FRANCISCO  August 23, 2007 
For the second quarter of 2007, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.21. The non-GAAP diluted earnings per share number excludes $0.02 per share of expenses associated with the company's cost reduction initiatives. Please see the reconciliation of diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis to diluted earnings per share excluding the expenses associated with the company's cost reduction initiatives, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the table at the end of this release.
Second quarter net sales were down 1 percent to $3.69 billion, compared with $3.71 billion for the second quarter of last year. Due to the 53
rd
week in fiscal year 2006, second quarter 2007 comparable store sales are compared with the thirteen weeks ended August 5, 2006. On this basis, comparable store sales decreased 5 percent, compared with a decrease of 5 percent as reported for the second quarter of 2006. The company's online sales for the second quarter increased 26 percent to $172 million, compared with $136 million for the second quarter of last year.
"During the second quarter, we made solid progress stabilizing our business, streamlining our organization and importantly, hiring our new chairman and chief executive officer, Glenn Murphy," said Bob Fisher, a member of Gap Inc.'s Board of Directors. "I am confident that under Glenn's leadership and the creative direction set by our brand presidents, we will continue to make improvements to the business and deliver improved returns to our shareholders."
"I want to thank Bob for his leadership in taking the necessary first steps towards stabilizing the business," said Glenn Murphy, chairman and chief executive officer of Gap Inc. "We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we have great brands with enormous potential, and I feel confident that our creative talent and dedicated store employees will help fuel our progress."
Store Sales Results By Division
The following table represents the company's second quarter comparable store sales and net sales by division:
 
Update on the Discontinued Operation of Forth & Towne
Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, Forth & Towne is recognized as a discontinued operation. For the first half of 2007, the company eliminated about 550 Forth & Towne positions. The pre-tax loss related to the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was approximately $9 million and for the first half of 2007 was approximately $54 million.
Update on Gap Inc.'s Cost Reduction Initiatives
As part of the company's efforts to streamline operations, the company eliminated about 1,200 positions, excluding Forth & Towne, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and, as a result, recognized approximately $20 million of expenses on a pre-tax basis, the majority of which are related to severance payments.
For the first half of 2007, Gap Inc. eliminated about 1,600 positions, excluding Forth & Towne. These cost reduction initiatives resulted in approximately $25 million of expenses on a pre-tax basis during this time period, the majority of which are related to severance benefits to employees at the company's headquarters.
In total, the company has eliminated about 2,200 positions during the first half of 2007, of which about one-third were open positions. At this point, the majority of the company's currently planned headcount eliminations are complete. Based on the actions taken in the first half of fiscal year 2007, the total annualized cost savings from the filled positions eliminated is expected to be about $100 million on a pre-tax basis.
Additional Results and 2007 Outlook
Earnings
The company revised its guidance for fiscal year 2007 diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis to $0.83 to $0.88 from its previous guidance of $0.76 to $0.86. The company also revised its guidance for fiscal year 2007 diluted earnings per share, excluding expenses associated with the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne and the company's cost reduction initiatives, to $0.90 to $0.95, compared to its previous guidance of $0.80 to $0.90.
Please see the reconciliation of expected diluted earnings per share excluding these costs, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP financial measure in the table at the end of this release.
The company expects the loss from the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne to be approximately $55 million for the full year. The company expects that expenses related to its cost reduction initiatives will be approximately $35 million for the full year, which includes $10 million of pre-tax charges in the second half of the year.
The impact of the loss from the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne, combined with expenses associated with the cost reduction initiatives, is expected to be about $0.07 per diluted share for fiscal year 2007.

Exhibit 99.2
Gap Inc.'s board of directors (NYSE: GPS) has authorized an additional $1.5 billion for the company's ongoing share repurchase program, underscoring the company's commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. With today's announcement, the company's repurchase authorizations total $5.75 billion since October of 2004.
SAN FRANCISCO  AUGUST 23, 2007 
In connection with this authorization, Gap Inc. also entered into purchase agreements with individual members of the Fisher family whose ownership represents approximately 17 percent of the company's outstanding shares. Multiple Fisher family members and entities currently own approximately 34 percent of Gap Inc. shares.
The company expects that about $250 million (approximately 17 percent) of the $1.5 billion share repurchase program will be purchased from these Fisher family members. The shares will be purchased each month at the same weighted average market price that the company is paying for share repurchases in the open market. The company notes that the overall percentage of the company's stock held by the Fisher family could fluctuate up or down or remain the same.
"Today's announcement reflects Gap Inc.'s strong cash generation and ongoing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders," said Byron Pollitt, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Gap Inc. "Members of the Fisher family have periodically sold stock since the company's initial public offering in 1976 in the normal course of investor diversification. The Fishers hold three seats on our Board of Directors and remain active in their roles as shareholders and directors in ensuring the company achieves its long-term objectives."
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, the company purchased 11 million shares for approximately $200 million, thereby completing a $750 million share repurchase authorization which was announced in August 2006. In total, the company has repurchased about 215 million shares for $4.25 billion since October 2004.
