Third Quarter Sales and Earnings Guidance
For the thirteen weeks ended November 3, 2007, total company net sales were $3.85 billion, which is flat as compared to net sales of $3.85 billion for the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2006. Due to the 53rdweek in fiscal year 2006, third quarter comparable store sales are compared to the thirteen weeks ended November 4, 2006. On this basis, the company's third quarter comparable store sales decreased 5 percent compared with a decrease of 5 percent in the third quarter of the prior year.
Comparable store sales by division for the third quarter were as follows:
Gap North America: negative 6 percent versus negative 7 percent last year
Banana Republic North America: positive 1 percent versus positive 3 percent last year
Old Navy North America: negative 8 percent versus negative 7 percent last year
International: negative 4 percent versus negative 6 percent last year
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, Gap Inc. expects diluted earnings per share to be $0.28 to $0.30, as the company continues to make progress on its strategies of driving earnings with healthy margins and controlling expenses. Third quarter earnings are benefiting from the absence of last year's incremental marketing expense. The expected third quarter earnings per share also includes about $0.01 of benefit relating to a reduction of interest accruals resulting from tax audits and other tax resolutions completed during the quarter.
The company reiterated that it expects the year-over-year percent change in inventory per square foot to be down in the mid-single digits at the end of the third quarter.
