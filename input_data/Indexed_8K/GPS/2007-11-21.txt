Exhibit 99.1
Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today reported that net earnings for the third quarter, which ended November 3, 2007, increased 26 percent to $238 million, or $0.30 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $189 million, or $0.23 per share on a diluted basis, for the third quarter of last year.
SAN FRANCISCO  November 21, 2007 
Third quarter net sales were $3.9 billion, which is flat compared with the third quarter of last year. Due to the 53
rd
week in fiscal year 2006, third quarter 2007 comparable store sales are compared with the thirteen weeks ended November 4, 2006. On this basis, comparable store sales decreased 5 percent, compared with a decrease of 5 percent for the third quarter of 2006. The company's online sales for the third quarter increased 36 percent to $247 million, compared with $182 million for the third quarter of last year.
"During the third quarter, we made progress in driving earnings growth by managing our inventory and reducing expenses," said Glenn Murphy, chairman and chief executive officer of Gap Inc. "Our brands are focused on the upcoming holiday season and providing customers with a compelling store experience."
Sales Results By Division
The following table represents the company's third quarter comparable store sales and net sales by division:
 
Additional Results and 2007 Outlook
Earnings
The company's third quarter of fiscal year 2007 diluted earnings per share of $0.30 benefited from lower marketing expenses compared with the prior year. As the company had previously stated, it did not intend to make the incremental marketing investments that it had made in the second half of fiscal year 2006. The incremental marketing expenses in the second half of fiscal year 2006 amounted to about $80 million.
The company realized substantially all of these savings  about $75 millionin the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. The company does not anticipate further significant reductions in marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 as compared with the fourth quarter of last year.
As a result of the improvement in the third quarter, Gap Inc. is increasing its fiscal year 2007 guidance of GAAP diluted earnings per share to $0.92 to $0.98 from its prior guidance of $0.83 to $0.88 per diluted share.
The company continues to expect expenses related to its cost reduction initiatives to be about $35 million for the full year. There were approximately $6 million of related expenses in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date expenses to about $32 million.
Excluding about $0.07 per diluted share of expenses associated with the cost reduction initiatives and the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne, the company is revising its fiscal year 2007 guidance upwards to $0.99 to $1.05 from its prior guidance of $0.90 to $0.95 diluted earnings per share. Please see the reconciliation of expected diluted earnings per share excluding these costs, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP financial measure in the table at the end of this release.
Effective Tax Rate
The effective tax rate was 39.5 percent for the third quarter of 2007. The company continues to expect the effective tax rate to be about 39 percent for full year 2007.
Cash and Debt
The company ended the third quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and investments, and $188 million in long-term debt. For the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007, free cash flow was an inflow of $484 million, compared with an inflow of $214 million last year. This increase was primarily driven by lower inventory levels and a change in vendor payment terms.
The company now expects to generate about $900 million in free cash flow for fiscal year 2007, driven by its upward revision in earnings, continued disciplined inventory management and change in vendor payment terms. Please see the reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to the GAAP financial measure in the table at the end of this release.
Share Repurchases and Dividends
During the third quarter, the company repurchased 48 million shares. The company has utilized $887 million of the $1.5 billion share repurchase program that was announced on August 23, 2007. Eight million of the total 48 million shares were repurchased from individual members of the Fisher family as part of the previously announced purchase agreements with them.
The company paid a dividend of $0.08 per share in the third quarter.
Margins
Gross margin of 37.5 percent increased 0.1 point in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year. Operating margin for the third quarter was 9.5 percent, which is 2.2 points higher than last year. The company reaffirmed that it expects operating margin for fiscal year 2007 to be in the high single-digits. Please see the financials sections on www.gapinc.com for the company's explanation of numerical range guidance.
Inventory
The company reported that inventory per square foot was down 8 percent at the end of the third quarter on a year-over-year basis as compared with flat inventory last year. The company continues to expect the percent change in inventory per square foot on a year-over-year basis to be down in the mid-single digits at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007.
Interest Expense
The company now expects fiscal year 2007 interest expense to be about $28 million.
Depreciation and Amortization
The company reaffirmed that it expects depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year 2007 to be about $550 million.
Capital Expenditures
Year-to-date capital expenditures were $519 million. The company reaffirmed that it expects capital spending to be about $700 million in fiscal year 2007, which includes about $235 million for new stores, about $310 million for existing stores, about $110 million for information technology and about $45 million for headquarters and distribution centers.
Real Estate
For the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007, the company opened 187 store locations and closed 127 store locations, and square footage increased 2 percent. This includes 19 Forth & Towne store closures and 45 Old Navy Outlet store conversions. The company reaffirmed that it expects to open 30 store locations on a net basis for fiscal year 2007. Square footage is still expected to increase about 1 percent for fiscal year 2007.

This press release and related conference call and webcast contain unaudited financial information for the third quarter of 2007 and forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "plan," and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding: (i) earnings and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007; (ii) outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007; (iii) diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis for fiscal year 2007; (iv) expenses related to the company's cost reduction initiatives for fiscal year 2007; (v) diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2007 excluding the expenses associated with the company's cost reduction initiatives and discontinued operation of Forth & Towne; (vi) effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007; (vii) free cash flow for fiscal year 2007; (viii) operating margin for fiscal year 2007; (ix) year-over-year change in inventory per square foot at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007; (x) interest expense for fiscal year 2007; (xi) depreciation and amortization for fiscal year 2007; (xii) capital spending for fiscal year 2007; (xiii) store openings and closings for fiscal year 2007; (xiv) increase in real estate square footage for fiscal year 2007; and (xv) net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2007.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: the risk that subsequent events may occur that require adjustments to the company's unaudited financial statements; the risk that the adoption of new accounting pronouncements will impact future results; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in gauging fashion trends and changing consumer preferences; the highly competitive nature of the company's business in the U.S. and internationally and its dependence on consumer spending patterns, which are influenced by numerous other factors; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in identifying and negotiating new store locations effectively; the risk that comparable store sales and margins will experience fluctuations; the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in implementing its strategic, operating and people initiatives; the risk that adverse changes in the company's credit ratings may have a negative impact on its financing costs and structure in future periods; the risk that trade matters, events causing disruptions in product shipments from China and other foreign countries, or IT systems changes may disrupt the company's supply chain or operations; the risk that acts or omissions by the company's third party vendors could have a negative impact on the company's reputation or operations; the risk that the company will not be successful in defending various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, claims, and audits; and the risk that the company does not repurchase some or all of the shares it anticipates purchasing pursuant to its repurchase
program; any of which could impact net sales, costs and expenses, and/or planned strategies. Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be found in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2007. Readers should also consult the company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended August 4, 2007 and May 5, 2007.
Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact net sales and profitability are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of November 21, 2007 and the company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.
