Earnings Guidance
The company reiterated its previous guidance of fiscal year 2007 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 to $0.98. The company reiterated that this range includes approximately $0.07 per diluted share of expenses associated with the company's cost reduction initiatives and the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne. Excluding these costs, the company continues to expect fiscal year 2007 diluted earnings per share of $0.99 to $1.05. Please see the reconciliation of expected diluted earnings per share excluding these costs, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP financial measure in the company's third quarter of fiscal year 2007 earnings release dated November 21, 2007 at www.gapinc.com.
December Sales
The company will report December sales on January 10, 2008.
