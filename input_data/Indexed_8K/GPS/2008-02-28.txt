Earnings and Effective Tax Rate
The company stated that it expects diluted earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.27 for fiscal year 2008. This guidance takes into account a range of outcomes dependent in part on product acceptance and the volatile macroeconomic environment.
The company's fourth quarter tax rate was 38.8 percent. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007 was 38.3 percent. The company expects the effective tax rate to be about 39 percent for fiscal year 2008.
Cash
The company ended the fourth quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Fiscal year 2007 free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, was an inflow of $1.4 billion compared with $678 million last year. The increase was driven primarily by lower inventory levels as well as changes in vendor payment terms. The company expects free cash flow to be about $900 million in fiscal year 2008. Please see the reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP financial measure in the table at the end of this release.

Exhibit 99.2
Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today announced its Board of Directors approved two decisions that underscore the company's financial health: an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization and a plan to increase the annual dividend per share by six percent, from $0.32 in 2007 to $0.34 in 2008. The dividend is expected to be paid quarterly in April, July, October, and January.
SAN FRANCISCO  FEBRUARY 28, 2008 
"In 2007, we distributed nearly $2 billion dollars to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases," said Sabrina Simmons, executive vice president and chief financial officer. "Today's announcement reinforces our commitment to use the strong cash flow generated by our operations to return excess cash to our shareholders."
In connection with the share repurchase authorization, Gap Inc. also entered into a second set of agreements with individual members of the Fisher family to repurchase shares. The company expects that about $158 million (approximately 16 percent) of the $1 billion share repurchase program will be purchased from these Fisher family members. The shares will be purchased each month at the same weighted average market price that the company is paying for share repurchases in the open market. Please see the company's August 23, 2007 press release for information regarding the first set of agreements with members of the Fisher family.
Multiple Fisher family members and entities own approximately 34 percent of Gap Inc. shares, as publicly reported in the company's 2007 Proxy Statement. The company notes that the overall percentage of the company's stock held by the Fisher family could fluctuate up or down or remain the same with the agreements announced today. Members of the Fisher family have periodically sold stock since the company's initial public offering in 1976 as part of their normal investor diversification. With three seats on the company's Board of Directors, the family remains active supporting the company's long-term objectives.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the company repurchased about 30 million shares for a total of $613 million, thereby completing a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Today's announcement brings the company's total share repurchase authorizations to $6.75 billion since October 2004.
