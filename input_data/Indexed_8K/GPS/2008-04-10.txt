Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today reported net sales of $1.37 billion for the five-week period ended April 5, 2008, which represents a 12 percent decrease compared with net sales of $1.55 billion for the same period ended April 7, 2007. The company's comparable store sales for March 2008 decreased 18 percent compared with a 6 percent increase for March 2007.
SAN FRANCISCO - April 10, 2008 -
Comparable store sales by division for March 2008 were as follows:
Gap North America: negative 14 percent versus positive 4 percent last year
Banana Republic North America: negative 8 percent versus positive 8 percent last year
Old Navy North America: negative 27 percent versus positive 10 percent last year
International: negative 3 percent versus negative 5 percent last year
"Overall March traffic and sales results across our brands were disappointing, particularly at Old Navy," said Sabrina Simmons, chief financial officer of Gap Inc. "With our continued inventory discipline across the brands, we delivered merchandise margins above last year. As we execute our strategy of delivering healthier earnings through improved margins and cost management, we remain comfortable with our previously communicated 2008 annual earnings per share guidance of $1.20-$1.27."
Year-to-date net sales of $2.28 billion for the nine weeks ended April 5, 2008, decreased 7 percent compared with net sales of $2.46 billion for the nine weeks ended April 7, 2007. The company's year-to-date comparable store sales decreased 13 percent compared with a 2 percent increase in the prior year.
The company reiterated that it expects diluted earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.27 for fiscal year 2008.
