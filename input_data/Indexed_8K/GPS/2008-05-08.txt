Old Navy North America: negative 12 percent versus negative 20 percent last year

First Quarter Sales Results and Earnings Guidance
For the thirteen weeks ended May 3, 2008, total company net sales were $3.38 billion, which is a decrease of 5 percent as compared with net sales of $3.55 billion for the thirteen weeks ended May 5, 2007. The company's first quarter comparable store sales decreased 11 percent compared with a decrease of 4 percent in the first quarter of the prior year.
Comparable store sales by division for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 were as follows:
Gap North America: negative 7 percent versus negative 4 percent last year
Banana Republic North America: negative 4 percent versus negative 2 percent last year
Old Navy North America: negative 18 percent versus negative 5 percent last year
International: negative 5 percent versus negative 3 percent last year
The company expects diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 to be $0.30 to $0.32. Included in the diluted earnings per share guidance for the first quarter is a benefit of about $15 million to pre-tax earnings from a reduction of interest expense accruals resulting primarily from foreign tax audit events occurring in the quarter.
Simmons added, "We are pleased with our ability to achieve bottom line earnings growth in the first quarter. However, our traffic patterns and sales continue to be challenging, it is still early in the year, and the economic environment remains volatile. We are reaffirming our earnings outlook for the year and continue to expect diluted earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.27."
