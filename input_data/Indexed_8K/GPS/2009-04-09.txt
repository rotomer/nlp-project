Exhibit 99.1
Gap Inc.

The company's comparable store sales for March 2009 were down 8 percent compared with an 18 percent decrease in March 2008.
SAN FRANCISCO - April 9, 2009 -
Comparable store sales by brand and region for March 2009 were as follows:
Gap North America: negative 14 percent versus negative 14 percent last year
Banana Republic North America: negative 16 percent versus negative 8 percent last year
Old Navy North America: flat versus negative 27 percent last year

"Although our sales results for March were mixed overall, we're pleased with the customer response to Old Navy's spring product and with our ability to deliver total company merchandise margins above last year," said Sabrina Simmons, chief financial officer of Gap Inc.
During March, the company ran its "Give & Get" promotion. Through the four-day sales event, employees were able to offer their friends and family a 30 percent discount on merchandise, and the company donated $1.5 million of those sales to help specific nonprofit organizations.
