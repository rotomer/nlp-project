On November 19, 2009, The Gap, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the authorization of $500 million for a new share repurchase program. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Concurrent with this authorization, on November 17, 2009, the Company entered into purchase agreements (the "Agreements") with certain individual members of the Fisher family: John J. Fisher and Robert J. Fisher (each, a "Seller"). Pursuant to the Agreements, the Company has agreed to buy and each Seller has agreed to sell a number of shares of the Company's common stock which in the aggregate among both of the Sellers would equal approximately 4% of the total number of shares purchased by the Company pursuant to this new $500 million repurchase program. The purchase price for the shares of the Company's common stock to be purchased from each Seller will be determined on a monthly basis and will be the weighted average price that the company pays for share repurchases pursuant to this new repurchase program in the open market. Either the Company or the individual Seller may terminate the agreement upon 15 business days notice. The foregoing description of the Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Agreements, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Transactions with Related Persons
Under a lease agreement approved by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, the Company leases a total of approximately 27,000 square feet of space in its One Harrison and Two Folsom San Francisco headquarter locations to Doris F. Fisher, William S. Fisher's mother, that is used primarily to display portions of her personal art collection. The agreements provide for base rent ranging from $30.00 to $42.35 per square foot per year over a 15-year term. Rental income from this leased space for fiscal 2008 was approximately $1 million. The Company believes that these rental rates were at least competitive when the agreements were entered into. The agreements also provide the Company and its employees significant benefits, including use of the space on a regular basis for corporate functions at no charge.
In February 2008, in connection with the Company's Board of Directors' authorization of a $1 billion share repurchase program, the Company entered into purchase agreements with the following individual members of the Fisher family: William S. Fisher, his brothers, John J. Fisher and Robert J. Fisher, and his parents, Doris F. Fisher and Donald G. Fisher. In total, the Company expects that approximately $147 million, or 15%, of the $1 billion share repurchase authorization will be purchased from the Fisher family under these agreements.
On November 17, 2009, in connection with the Company's Board of Directors' authorization of a $500 million share repurchase program, the Company entered into purchase agreements with the following individual members of the Fisher family: John J. Fisher and Robert J. Fisher. In total, the Company expects that approximately $20 million, or 4%, of the $500 million share purchase authorization will be purchased from the Fisher family under these agreements.
 
On November 19, 2009, the Company issued a press release announcing the authorization of $500 million for a new share repurchase program. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

SAN FRANCISCO  November 19, 2009 
"We're pleased with our third quarter results, particularly our ability to deliver earnings 25 percent above last year and our highest third-quarter operating margin in a decade," said Glenn Murphy, chairman and chief executive officer.

Financial Performance Highlights
 
 
 
 
Sales Results
Third quarter net sales were $3.59 billion, compared with $3.56 billion for the third quarter of last year. The company's third quarter comparable store sales were flat compared with a decrease of 12 percent for the third quarter of last year.

Margins
Gross margin of 42.5 percent for the third quarter increased 380 basis points compared with the prior year.
Operating margin was 13.9 percent for the third quarter compared with 11.1 percent for the prior year.
Operating Expenses
Due largely to investments in fall marketing at Gap and Old Navy, operating expenses were up $40 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 compared with last year.
The company expects operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 to be up about $100 million to $120 million compared with the prior year. This increase is due to increased marketing expense, higher variable store-related costs related to the company's objective of driving comparable store sales improvement, and higher bonus expenses in the fourth quarter.
The company expects fourth quarter marketing expenses to be up about $45 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
Effective Tax Rate
The effective tax rate was 38.6 percent for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. The company continues to expect that the effective tax rate will be about 39 percent for fiscal year 2009.
Share Repurchases
During the third quarter, the company repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares for $91 million. Approximately 0.6 million of the total 4.1 million shares were repurchased from individual members of the Fisher family as part of previously announced purchase agreements with them.
In a separate release today, the company announced that its board of directors authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase program, and that it has entered into new purchase agreements with members of the Fisher family. The company expects that about $20 million (approximately 4 percent) of the $500 million share repurchase program, will be purchased from these Fisher family members.
Dividends
The company paid a dividend of $0.085 per share during the third quarter.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
The company ended the third quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Year to date, free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, was an inflow of $931 million compared with an inflow of $519 million last year. Please see the reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from the GAAP financial measure in the tables at the end of this release.
Inventory
On a year-over-year basis, the company reported that inventory per square foot was down 9 percent at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, the company expects inventory per square foot to be about flat compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.

Capital Expenditures
Year to date, capital expenditures were $221 million. The company continues to expect capital spending of about $350 million for fiscal year 2009.
Real Estate
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, the company opened 13 store locations and closed 15 store locations. This compares with 37 openings and 17 closings for the third quarter of the prior year.

Exhibit 99.3
Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) today announced that Bill Fisher, son of the company founders Doris and Don Fisher and former 15-year veteran of the company, was elected to serve on the Board of Directors, effective immediately. Mr. Fisher was named by the Board to fill the seat previously held by his father, Don, who passed away in September.
San Francisco  November 17, 2009 
Since the company went public in 1976, at least two members of the Fisher family have served on the Board of Directors. Bill joins the Board alongside his brother, Bob, who has served on the Board since 1990. Their mother, Doris, is an honorary lifetime director.
"We're thrilled that Bill Fisher is re-joining our company as a member of the Board of Directors," said Glenn Murphy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gap Inc. "Bill helped establish our International division during his time with the company, and he'll bring both his extensive global experience and business acumen to contribute on a number of fronts. All of us on the Board benefit from the experience and perspective that Doris, Bob and Bill bring to our discussions."
Mr. Fisher worked in various operating roles at the company, starting as a Banana Republic store manager in 1984. After four years with Banana Republic, he joined Gap brand, where he started and built the International Division, including operations in Canada, France, the United Kingdom and Japan. In 1998, he decided to leave the company and founded private equity fund Manzanita Capital. Today, he continues to guide Manzanita and works with several non-profit organizations in San Francisco.
"I believe I am joining when there is a great chapter ahead for Gap," said Bill Fisher. "I hope to contribute to the future growth of the company and support our shareholders' interests."
