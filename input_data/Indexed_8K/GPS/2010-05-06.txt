SAN FRANCISCO - May 6, 2010 -
In addition, the company reported that net sales for the first quarter, which ended May 1, 2010, grew 6 percent to $3.33 billion compared with $3.13 billion for the first quarter last year. The company's first quarter comparable store sales increased 4 percent compared with a decrease of 8 percent in the first quarter of the prior year.
"With sales growth across all of our brands and significantly improved earnings, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance," said Sabrina Simmons, chief financial officer of Gap Inc.
First Quarter Guidance
The company expects diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 to be $0.43 to $0.44, which is an increase of about 40 percent compared with $0.31 for the first quarter last year and exceeds the current First Call estimate of $0.40. The expected first quarter diluted earnings per share includes a benefit of about $0.02 related to the favorable resolution of tax uncertainties in the quarter. Though the company experienced tax favorability in the first quarter, it continues to expect an effective tax rate of about 39 percent for the full year.
