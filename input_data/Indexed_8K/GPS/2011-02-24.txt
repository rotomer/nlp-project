SAN FRANCISCO  February 24, 2011 
"During 2010, we executed well on our goal of delivering sales improvement alongside our fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth," said Glenn Murphy, chairman and chief executive officer of Gap Inc. "We remain committed to investing in the future and executing with speed and consistency, allowing us to capitalize on the enormous global growth potential ahead of us."
Over the past year, Gap Inc. delivered on its promise to bring more customers worldwide the opportunity to purchase its products. In fiscal year 2010, the company opened its first flagship stores in Italy and China and expanded its online presence to over 90 countries, including the launch of dedicated sites in Canada, Europe and China. The company's online and international businesses represented 22 percent of the total fiscal year 2010 revenue, up 2 percent from the previous year.
Top line growth will continue to be a focus in fiscal year 2011. The company plans to make targeted, long-term growth investments such as the following: continuing to remodel Old Navy stores with the goal of having nearly 400 in the new format by the end of fiscal year 2011; opening about 75 new franchise stores; opening about 50 company-owned stores internationally, including about 10 to 15 stores in China, 8 to 10 stores in Italy, and 25 outlet stores; expanding Athleta in North America, with about 8 to 10 store openings by the end of fiscal year 2011; and continuing to grow online, both internationally and domestically.

Additional Results and 2011 Outlook
Earnings per Share
The company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.93 for fiscal year 2011.
Depreciation and Amortization
Fiscal year 2010 depreciation and amortization expense, net of amortization of lease incentives, was $562 million. The company expects depreciation and amortization expense, net of amortization of lease incentives, for fiscal year 2011 to be about $550 million.

Fiscal year 2010 operating expenses were $3.9 billion, about flat to last year. Marketing expenses for the full year were $516 million.
Operating Margin
The company expects that operating margin for fiscal year 2011 will likely decrease driven by pressure from sourcing cost inflation.
Effective Tax Rate
The effective tax rate was 38.9 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2010 was 39.3 percent. The company expects the effective tax rate to be about 39 percent for fiscal year 2011.
Inventory
On a year-over-year basis, the company reported that inventory per square foot was up 9 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Given Gap Inc.'s objective to at least maintain sales in downsized stores in North America, the company is transitioning to a new metric, inventory per store. On a year-over-year basis, inventory per store was up 8 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. The company expects inventory per store at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 to be up in the high single digits compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
