Exhibit 99.1
Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today reported that July 2011 net sales remained flat compared with last year.
SAN FRANCISCO - August 4, 2011 -
Net sales for the four-week period ended July 30, 2011 were $949 million compared with net sales of $948 million for the four-week period ended July 31, 2010. The company's comparable sales for July 2011, which include the associated comparable online sales, were down 5 percent compared with a 2 percent increase for July 2010.
In addition, the company reported that net sales for the second quarter, which ended July 30, 2011, increased 2 percent to $3.39 billion compared with $3.32 billion for the second quarter last year. The company's second quarter comparable sales, which include the associated comparable online sales, were down 2 percent compared with a 1 percent increase in the second quarter of the prior year.
"While July proved to be challenging, we're pleased that we grew net sales for the quarter and that we're able to guide earnings per share above analyst expectations," said Glenn Murphy, chairman and chief executive officer of Gap Inc.
Second Quarter Guidance
The company expects diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.34.
During the quarter, the company implemented improvements that enhance the precision of estimating in-transit inventory. Primarily driven by this enhancement, the company now expects inventory per store at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 to be up in the mid-single digits compared to the second quarter of last year.

Comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, including the associated comparable online sales, were as follows:
Gap North America: negative 3 percent versus negative 3 percent last year
