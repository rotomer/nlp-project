Exhibit 99.1
- Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today reported that December 2011 net sales decreased 1 percent compared with last year.
SAN FRANCISCO - January 5, 2012
Net sales for the five-week period ended December 31, 2011 were $1.98 billion compared with net sales of $2.01 billion for the five-week period ended January 1, 2011. The company's comparable sales for December 2011, which include the associated comparable online sales, were down 4 percent compared with a 2 percent decrease for December 2010.
"We expected December to be highly promotional, and while we competed aggressively across our brands, our performance was below our expectations," said Glenn Murphy, chairman and CEO of Gap Inc. "That said, we are encouraged by bright spots across our business, and we're clear and focused on what needs to be fixed in order to improve our sales trend in 2012."
Comparable sales for December 2011, which include the associated comparable online sales, were as follows:
Gap North America: negative 4 percent versus negative 6 percent last year
Banana Republic North America: negative 2 percent versus positive 2 percent last year
Old Navy North America: negative 4 percent versus flat last year
International: negative 6 percent versus negative 3 percent last year
Year-to-date net sales were $13.72 billion for the 48 weeks ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of 1 percent compared with net sales of $13.82 billion for the 48 weeks ended January 1, 2011. The company's year-to-date comparable sales, which include the associated comparable online sales, decreased 4 percent compared with a 2 percent increase last year.
