Additional Results and 2012 Outlook
Earnings per Share
Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.49 increased 40 percent compared with $0.35 for the second quarter last year.
The company raised its guidance for fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.00, compared with $1.56 in fiscal year 2011.
Depreciation and Amortization
The company continues to expect depreciation and amortization expense, net of amortization of lease incentives, for fiscal year 2012 to be about $475 million.
Operating Expenses
Second quarter operating expenses were approximately $1 billion, up $85 million compared with the second quarter last year, due primarily to investments in marketing and store payroll. Marketing expenses for the quarter were $147 million, up $33 million compared with the second quarter last year, driven primarily by investments at Gap brand.
The company plans to continue investing in its businesses and expects operating expenses in each of the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2012 to increase, on a year-over-year basis, by at least as much as the increase in the second quarter. As a result, the company continues to expect operating expense deleverage in the second half of fiscal year 2012.
Operating Margin
The company now expects operating margin for fiscal year 2012 to be about 11 percent, up from previous guidance of about 10 percent.
Effective Tax Rate
The effective tax rate was 40 percent for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. The company continues to expect the full year effective tax rate to be about 39.5 percent for fiscal year 2012.

On a year-over-year basis, inventory dollars per store were down 6 percent at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. The company expects inventory dollars per store to be down in the low single digits at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared with the end of the third quarter last year.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-term Investments
The company ended the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 with $2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Year to date, free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, was an inflow of $673 million compared with an inflow of $298 million last year. Please see the reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from the GAAP financial measure in the tables at the end of this press release.

Square footage of company-operated stores was 36.8 million at the end of the second quarter, a decrease of 2 percent from 37.7 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2011.
