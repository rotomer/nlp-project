SAN FRANCISCO  November 15, 2012 
Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) today reported strong third quarter earnings, underscoring its continued progress on key business strategies.
Net sales for the third quarter, which ended October 27, 2012, increased 8 percent to $3.86 billion compared with $3.59 billion for the third quarter last year. The companys third quarter comparable sales increased 6 percent. Net income for the third quarter was $308 million, up 60 percent compared with the third quarter last year. Third quarter diluted earnings per share rose 66 percent to $0.63 compared with $0.38 last year.
We're very pleased with our strong third quarter financial performance, highlighted by how well customers have responded to our product, said Glenn Murphy, chairman and chief executive officer of Gap Inc. We are ready to compete and win this holiday season as we drive to build upon our top line growth.
Given its progress year-to-date, the company raised its estimate for fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.25. It also increased its fiscal year 2012 operating margin guidance from about 11 percent to about 12 percent.

Additional Results and 2012 Outlook
Earnings per Share
Third quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.63 increased 66 percent compared with $0.38 for the third quarter last year. This includes a benefit of about $0.02 related to tax credits.
The company increased its fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.25. This compares with diluted earnings per share of $1.56 in fiscal year 2011.
Depreciation and Amortization
The company continues to expect depreciation and amortization expense, net of amortization of lease incentives, for fiscal year 2012 to be about $475 million.
Operating Expenses
Third quarter operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up $105 million compared with the third quarter last year, with continued investments in marketing and store payroll. Marketing expenses for the quarter were $178 million, up $29 million compared with the third quarter last year, driven primarily by investments in Gap brand marketing and customer relationship marketing.
The company is continuing to invest in its businesses, and on a year-over-year basis, expects operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 to increase by at least as much as the 11 percent increase in the third quarter. As a result, the company continues to expect operating expenses to deleverage in the fourth quarter.
Operating Margin
The company now expects operating margin for fiscal year 2012 to be about 12 percent, up from its previous guidance of about 11 percent.
Effective Tax Rate
The effective tax rate was 38.3 percent for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. The company now expects the full year effective tax rate to be about 39.0 percent for fiscal year 2012, down from previous guidance of about 39.5 percent.
Inventory
On a year-over-year basis, inventory dollars per store were down 4 percent at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. The company expects inventory dollars per store to be up in the low single digits at the end of fiscal year 2012 compared with the end of the 2011 fiscal year.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-Term Investments
As previously communicated, the company repaid the $360 million balance on its term loan during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. The company ended the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Year-to-date, free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, was an inflow of $776 million compared with an inflow of $222 million last year. Please see the reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from the GAAP financial measure in the tables at the end of this press release.
Share Repurchases
The company has repurchased $463 million in shares year-to-date. Third quarter share repurchases were 2.7 million shares for $96 million, and the company ended the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 with 480 million shares outstanding.
Dividends
The company paid a dividend of $0.125 per share during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, which was an increase of 11 percent compared with the third quarter last year. The company announced on Monday of this week that its Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share payable on or after January 30, 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 2, 2013. With this announcement, the company will pay a total of $0.50 per share in dividends for fiscal year 2012.
Capital Expenditures
Year-to-date capital expenditures were $449 million. The company expects fiscal year 2012 capital spending of about $675 million.
Real Estate
The company ended the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 with a total of 3,339 store locations in 45 countries, 3,068 of which were company-operated.
On a year-to-date basis, the company opened 107 and closed 75 company-operated store locations. Square footage of company-operated stores was 36.9 million at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of about 2 percent from 37.6 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. This decrease reflects Gap Inc.s strategy to optimize square footage in North America.
The company continues to expect net openings of about 15 company-operated stores and about 50 to 75 franchise stores during fiscal year 2012. Square footage for company-operated stores is expected to decrease by about 1 percent by the end of fiscal year 2012 compared with the end of fiscal year 2011.
