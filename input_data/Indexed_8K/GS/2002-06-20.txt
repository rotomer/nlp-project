Item 5. Other Events.
         On June 20, 2002, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. reported net earnings of $563 million for its fiscal second quarter ended May 31, 2002. Earnings per diluted share were $1.06 compared to $0.98 for the 2002 first quarter and $1.06 for the second quarter of 2001. Annualized return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 16.3% for the second quarter and 15.8% for the first half of 2002.

Investment Banking
         Net revenues in Investment Banking were $762 million, compared to $893 million for the first quarter of 2002 and $792 million for the second quarter of 2001.
         Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $428 million, 33% higher than the second quarter of 2001, principally due to increased mergers and acquisitions in the financial institutions, real estate and consumer sectors. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $334 million compared to $471 million for the same 2001 period, primarily reflecting lower equity issuance activity in the natural resources and communications, media and entertainment sectors and lower net revenues in debt underwriting. The firm's backlog declined slightly during the quarter.
Trading and Principal Investments
         Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $1.44 billion for the second quarter, 8% higher than the first quarter of 2002 and 15% lower than the second quarter of 2001.
         FICC net revenues of $1.14 billion increased 21% compared to the same 2001 period, primarily reflecting strong performances in leveraged finance, currencies and fixed income derivatives, partially offset by decreased net revenues in commodities.
         Net revenues in Equities were $418 million compared to $739 million for the second quarter of 2001, primarily due to lower net revenues in the firm's U.S. shares trading business, reflecting the continued weakness in the equity markets and the transfer of the Nasdaq fee-based business to Commissions, as well as lower net revenues in equity arbitrage.

         Principal Investments recorded negative net revenues of $125 million due to declines in the fair value of certain private investments, primarily in the high technology and telecommunications sectors.
Asset Management and Securities Services
         Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.65 billion, 20% higher than the first quarter of 2002 and 10% above the second quarter of 2001.
         Asset Management net revenues of $443 million increased 24% compared to last year's second quarter, reflecting a 13% increase in average assets under management, higher incentive income and increased fund origination fees.
         Securities Services net revenues were $262 million compared to $287 million for the same 2001 period, primarily due to decreased spreads in the firm's fixed income matched book. Net revenues from the firm's securities and margin lending business were essentially unchanged compared to the same prior year period.
         Commissions were $948 million compared to $862 million for the same period last year due to higher net revenues in the firm's global shares businesses, in part reflecting the transfer of the Nasdaq fee-based business into Commissions, partially offset by lower merchant banking overrides (i.e., an increased share of a fund's income and gains) and reduced clearing and execution fees.
         Operating expenses were $2.95 billion, 7% above the first quarter of 2002 and 3% below last year's second quarter.
         Compensation and benefits of $1.93 billion increased 1% compared to the same period last year. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50% for the first half of 2002 compared to 49% for the first half of 2001. Employment levels decreased 4% during the quarter and 7% compared to the end of 2001.
         Non-compensation-related expenses were $941 million for the quarter. Excluding amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, these expenses declined 4% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower levels of business activity and the continued effect of expense reduction initiatives implemented during 2001. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was lower than in the second quarter of 2001 reflecting the adoption of the goodwill non-amortization provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
         The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of 2002 was 37.5%, unchanged from the first quarter of 2002 and fiscal year 2001 and down compared to 39% for the second quarter of 2001.

         As of May 31, 2002, total capital was $53.36 billion, consisting of $18.86 billion in shareholders' equity and $34.50 billion in long-term debt. Book value per share was $38.13, based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 494.6 million at period end. The firm repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock during the quarter.
         The Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. declared a dividend of $0.12 per share to be paid on August 29, 2002 to common shareholders of record on July 30, 2002.
         On June 21, 2002, approximately 39 million shares of common stock related to the firm's initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent acquisitions become eligible for sale. In addition, approximately 12 million employee stock options granted at the time of the IPO and in subsequent acquisitions become exercisable on that date. Separately, in connection with the firm's ongoing policy of facilitating the orderly entry of shares into the market, up to an additional 14 million shares of common stock may become eligible for sale during the third quarter. Substantially all of the above-referenced shares are subject to compliance with blackout procedures and volume restrictions.
