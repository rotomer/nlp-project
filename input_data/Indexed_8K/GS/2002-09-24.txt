         On September 24, 2002, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. reported net earnings of $522 million for its fiscal third quarter ended August 30, 2002. Earnings per diluted share were $1.00 compared to $0.87 for the third quarter of 2001 and $1.06 for the 2002 second quarter. Annualized return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 15.6% for the first nine months of 2002 and 15.1% for the third quarter.

Investment Banking
         Net revenues in Investment Banking were $652 million, compared to $1.10 billion for the third quarter of 2001 and $762 million for the second quarter of 2002.
         Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $315 million, compared to $638 million for the third quarter of 2001, reflecting significantly reduced industry-wide activity in mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $337 million compared to $464 million for the same 2001 period, primarily due to lower net revenues from debt new issuance activity.
         The reduction in Investment Banking net revenues compared to the same period last year was due to lower levels of activity across all sectors, particularly communications, media and entertainment and high technology. The firm's backlog declined significantly during the quarter.
Trading and Principal Investments
         Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $1.49 billion for the third quarter, 21% higher than the third quarter of 2001 and 4% above the second quarter of 2002.
         FICC net revenues of $1.31 billion increased 19% compared to the same 2001 period, primarily reflecting strong performances in the firm's fixed income derivatives, mortgages, currencies and investment-grade credit businesses, partially offset by decreased net revenues in leveraged finance and commodities.
         Net revenues in Equities were $281 million compared to $573 million for the third quarter of 2001, reflecting lower net revenues in the firm's global shares businesses, which were affected by the continued weakness in the global equity markets and the transfer of the Nasdaq fee-based business to Commissions, as well as lower net revenues in equity arbitrage.

         Principal Investments recorded negative net revenues of $100 million, primarily due to declines in the fair value of certain investments in the high technology and telecommunications sectors, partially offset by real estate disposition gains.
Asset Management and Securities Services
         Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.50 billion, 14% above the third quarter of 2001 and 9% lower than the second quarter of 2002.
         Asset Management net revenues of $400 million increased 5% compared to last year's third quarter, reflecting a 6% increase in average assets under management. Assets under management were $336 billion at the end of the quarter, 3% higher than a year ago. During the quarter, assets under management declined 4%, reflecting net asset outflows of $1.6 billion and market depreciation of $12.4 billion.
         Securities Services net revenues were $266 million compared to $295 million for the same 2001 period, primarily due to lower net revenues in the firm's margin lending business and fixed income matched book.
         Commissions were $838 million compared to $649 million for the same period last year, primarily due to the transfer of the Nasdaq fee-based business into Commissions, as well as increased fees earned on higher transaction volumes in global equity markets.
         Operating expenses were $2.86 billion, 1% below last year's third quarter and 3% below the second quarter of 2002.
         Compensation and benefits of $1.82 billion increased 2% compared to the same period last year. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50% for the first nine months of 2002 compared to 49% for the first nine months of 2001. Employment levels decreased 2% during the quarter and 9% compared to the end of 2001.
         Non-compensation-related expenses were $974 million for the quarter. Excluding amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, these expenses increased 2% compared to the same period last year. The growth in non-compensation-related expenses reflects higher occupancy expenses, primarily due to one-time costs related to the postponement of construction plans for a smaller facility adjacent to the firm's office building currently under construction in Jersey City, New Jersey, as well as increased brokerage, clearance and execution fees. These increases were partially offset by lower market development and communications and technology costs. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was lower than in the third quarter of 2001 reflecting the adoption of the goodwill non-amortization provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
 
         The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2002 was 36.5%, down from 37.5% for both the first half of 2002 and fiscal year 2001.
         As of August 30, 2002, total capital was $56.60 billion, consisting of $18.84 billion in shareholders' equity and $37.76 billion in long-term debt. Book value per share was $38.18, based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 493.5 million at period end. The firm repurchased 5.5 million shares of its common stock during the quarter.
         The Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. declared a dividend of $0.12 per share to be paid on November 25, 2002 to common shareholders of record on October 28, 2002.
