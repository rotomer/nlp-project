Investment Banking
     
Full Year
     Net revenues in Investment Banking were $2.83 billion for the year compared to $3.84 billion in 2001.
     Net revenues in Financial Advisory decreased 28% from the prior year to $1.50 billion, reflecting a 49% decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business declined 25% to $1.33 billion, primarily reflecting a 17% decline in industry-wide initial public offerings and a 7% decline in industry-wide total equity underwriting volume, as well as lower net revenues from debt underwriting.

     The reduction in Investment Banking net revenues was primarily due to lower levels of activity across all sectors, particularly communications, media and entertainment, natural resources, high technology and healthcare. The firm's investment banking backlog increased slightly during the fourth quarter but was significantly lower than at the end of 2001.

Fourth Quarter
     Net revenues in Investment Banking were $523 million, compared to $797 million for the fourth quarter of 2001 and $652 million for the third quarter of 2002.
     Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $299 million, compared to $381 million for the fourth quarter of 2001, reflecting significantly reduced industry-wide activity in mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $224 million compared to $416 million for the same 2001 period, primarily reflecting lower equity issuance activity.
Trading and Principal Investments
     
Full Year
     Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $5.25 billion for the year, compared to $6.35 billion in 2001.
     FICC net revenues of $4.47 billion increased 10% compared to 2001, reflecting strong performances in the firm's currencies, mortgages, fixed income derivatives, and investment-grade credit businesses, partially offset by decreased net revenues in commodities and leveraged finance.
     Net revenues in Equities were $1.01 billion compared to $2.92 billion for 2001, primarily reflecting lower net revenues in the firm's global shares businesses, which were affected by the continued weakness in the equity markets, the transfer of the Nasdaq fee-based business into Commissions and the negative effect of a single block trade in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, net revenues in equity derivatives and equity arbitrage were lower than the prior year.

     Principal Investments recorded negative net revenues of $229 million primarily due to declines in the value of certain investments in the high technology and telecommunications sectors, partially offset by real estate and energy sector disposition gains.
     As of November 29, 2002, the aggregate carrying value of the firm's principal investments held directly or through the firm's merchant banking funds was $1.78 billion, consisting of corporate principal investments of $1.04 billion and real estate principal investments of $744 million.
     
Fourth Quarter

     FICC net revenues were $793 million compared to $867 million for the fourth quarter of 2001, reflecting lower net revenues in commodities, fixed income derivatives and global money markets, partially offset by strong performances in the firm's currencies and investment-grade credit businesses.
     Net revenues in Equities were $204 million compared to $435 million for the fourth quarter of 2001, primarily reflecting lower net revenues in the firm's global shares businesses, in part due to the transfer of the Nasdaq fee-based business into Commissions, as well as lower net revenues in equity derivatives, partially offset by higher net revenues in equity arbitrage.

     Principal Investments recorded negative net revenues of $7 million, primarily due to declines in the value of certain private investments, partially offset by real estate disposition gains.
Asset Management and Securities Services
     
Full Year
     Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $5.91 billion for the year, 5% higher than 2001.
     Asset Management net revenues of $1.65 billion increased 12% compared to last year, primarily reflecting an 8% increase in average assets under management and increased incentive income. Assets under management were $348 billion at the end of 2002, essentially flat compared to the end of 2001. Market depreciation of $12 billion, primarily in equity assets, was partially offset by net asset inflows of $9 billion, primarily in fixed income and equity assets.
     Securities Services net revenues were $981 million compared to $1.13 billion for 2001, primarily reflecting lower net revenues in the firm's margin lending business and fixed income matched book.
     Commissions were $3.27 billion, up 8% compared to 2001, primarily due to increased net revenues in the firm's shares businesses, in part due to the transfer of the Nasdaq fee-based business into Commissions, partially offset by lower merchant banking overrides (i.e., an increased share of a fund's income and gains when the return on the fund's investments exceeds certain threshold returns) and reduced clearing fees.
     
Fourth Quarter
     Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.38 billion, essentially unchanged compared to the fourth quarter of 2001 and 9% lower than the third quarter of 2002.
     Asset Management net revenues of $387 million increased 5% compared to last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to higher management fees and increased incentive income. During the quarter, assets under management increased 4% reflecting $10 billion in net asset inflows, primarily in money market and equity assets, and $2 billion in market appreciation.
     Securities Services net revenues were $246 million compared to $270 million for the fourth quarter of 2001, primarily reflecting lower net revenues in the firm's fixed income matched book and margin lending business.

     Commissions were $742 million compared to $731 million for the same period last year, reflecting higher equity commissions, in part due to the transfer of the Nasdaq fee-based business into Commissions, partially offset by lower merchant banking overrides.
     Operating expenses were $10.73 billion for 2002, 11% below 2001.
     Compensation and benefits of $6.74 billion decreased 12% compared to the prior year, commensurate with lower net revenue levels. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for fiscal year 2002 was 48% compared to 49% for fiscal 2001. Employment levels decreased 13% from November 2001.
     Non-compensation-related expenses were $3.70 billion for 2002, 6% below 2001. Excluding amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, these expenses decreased 3% compared to last year reflecting lower market development and communications and technology costs, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was lower than in 2001 reflecting the adoption of the goodwill non-amortization provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
     The effective income tax rate for 2002 was 35.0%, down from 37.5% for 2001. The decline in the effective income tax rate as compared to 2001 was primarily due to a change in the firm's geographic earnings mix combined with ongoing efforts to convert major operating subsidiaries around the world to corporate form, an increase in tax-exempt income and an increase in domestic tax credits.
     As of November 29, 2002, total capital was $57.71 billion, consisting of $19.00 billion in shareholders' equity and $38.71 billion in long-term debt. Book value per share was $38.69, based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 491.2 million at period end.
     On November 20, 2002, the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the Board) authorized the repurchase of an additional 15 million shares of common stock pursuant to the firm's existing share repurchase program. The firm repurchased 19.4 million shares of its common stock during 2002, including 6.4 million shares in the fourth quarter.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
     Statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K may constitute "forward-looking statements". These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control.

     Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that we expect to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2001.
