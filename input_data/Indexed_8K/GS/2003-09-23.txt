Investment Banking
     Net revenues in Investment Banking were $687 million compared to $652 million for the third quarter of 2002 and $659 million for the second quarter of 2003. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $304 million compared to $315 million for the third quarter of 2002, reflecting continued weakness in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $383 million compared to $337 million for the same 2002 period, primarily reflecting higher net revenues from debt new issuance activity. The firm's investment banking backlog declined during the quarter.
Trading and Principal Investments
     Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $1.62 billion compared to $1.49 billion for the third quarter of 2002 and $2.01 billion for the second quarter of 2003.
     Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) net revenues of $828 million decreased 37% compared to the same 2002 period, primarily due to weak results in mortgages and currencies, reflecting higher interest rates, widening mortgage spreads and volatile currency markets. Net revenues in interest rate products were lower compared to a particularly strong third quarter of 2002. These decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues in credit products, which benefited from continued narrowing of credit spreads.
     Net revenues in Equities were $441 million compared to $281 million for the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to higher net revenues in equity arbitrage, as well as in the firm's global shares businesses, partially offset by lower net revenues in equity derivatives, reflecting reduced market volatility.
     Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $346 million, primarily due to an unrealized gain related to the firm's convertible preferred stock investment in Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) of $277 million, as well as increases in the fair value of other corporate principal investments.

Asset Management and Securities Services
     Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.49 billion compared to $1.50 billion for the third quarter of 2002 and $1.32 billion for the second quarter of 2003.
     Asset Management net revenues of $481 million increased 20% compared to last year's third quarter, primarily reflecting higher assets under management, the contribution from Ayco, which was acquired on July 1, 2003, and increased incentive income. During the quarter, assets under management increased 5%, reflecting net asset inflows of $10 billion, spread across all asset classes, $4 billion from the acquisition of Ayco, primarily in fixed income and equity assets, and market appreciation of $5 billion, primarily in equity assets.

     Securities Services net revenues were $326 million compared to $266 million for the same 2002 period, primarily reflecting higher customer balances in the firm's securities lending and margin lending businesses.
     Commissions were $684 million compared to $838 million for the same period last year, primarily reflecting lower equity commissions in the firm's U.S. shares businesses, reduced clearing fees and lower merchant banking overrides.
     Operating expenses were $2.81 billion, essentially unchanged from last year's third quarter.
     Compensation and benefits of $1.90 billion increased 4% compared to the same period last year, commensurate with higher net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50% for the first nine months of 2003, consistent with the first nine months of 2002. Employment levels increased 6% during the quarter to 19,476, due primarily to the inclusion of 1,028 employees from the acquisition of Ayco. Excluding Ayco, employment levels were essentially unchanged during the quarter.
     Non-compensation-related expenses of $898 million decreased 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily reflecting lower depreciation and amortization expenses, occupancy expenses, brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, and market development expenses.
     The effective income tax rate was 33% for the first nine months of 2003, down from 34% for the first half of 2003 and 35% for fiscal year 2002. The lower effective income tax rate reflects an increase in tax credits and a change in the firm's geographic earnings mix.
     As of August 29, 2003, total capital was $72.89 billion, consisting of $20.44 billion in shareholders' equity and $52.45 billion in long-term debt. Book value per share was $41.72 based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no

     During the quarter, the firm repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $85.32 per share. The remaining share authorization under the firm's existing common stock repurchase program is 9.9 million shares.
     The Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. declared a dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid on November 24, 2003 to common shareholders of record on October 27, 2003.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
     This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 29, 2002.
     Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that the firm expects to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 29, 2002.
