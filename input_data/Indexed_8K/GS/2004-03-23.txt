Diluted earnings per share were $2.50 compared with $1.29 for the first quarter of 2003 and $1.89 for the fourth quarter of 2003. Annualized return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 30.4%, and annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 23.5% for the first quarter of 2004.

Investment Banking
     Net revenues in Investment Banking were $763 million compared with $718 million for the first quarter of 2003 and $647 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. Net revenues in Financial Advisory of $359 million increased 7% compared with the same period last year, but reflected continued weakness in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $404 million compared with $381 million for the same 2003 period, primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide equity and equity-related offerings, offset in part by lower net revenues from debt underwriting. The firm's investment banking backlog increased during the quarter.
Trading and Principal Investments
     Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $4.12 billion, 47% above the first quarter of 2003 and 57% above the fourth quarter of 2003.
     Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) rose to $2.10 billion, an increase of 9% compared with the previous record set in last year's first quarter, as each of the major businesses performed well. FICC continued to operate in a favorable environment characterized by low interest rates, a steep yield curve, narrow credit spreads and volatile markets. The increase was driven by significantly higher net revenues in credit products and currencies. In addition, net revenues in interest rate products, mortgages and commodities were strong, but were lower compared with the first quarter of 2003.
     Net revenues in Equities rose to $1.66 billion, an increase of 77% compared with the first quarter of 2003, as the business operated in a more favorable environment, characterized by stronger equity markets and increased customer-driven activity. Net revenues were significantly higher in the global equities products groups, reflecting particularly strong results across shares and derivatives. Net revenues were also significantly higher in the firm's principal strategies business.

     Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $359 million, primarily due to an unrealized gain related to the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) of $201 million, gains from other corporate principal investments and the recognition of merchant banking overrides.
Asset Management and Securities Services
     Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.04 billion compared with $666 million for the first quarter of 2003 and $778 million for the fourth quarter of 2003.
     Asset Management net revenues of $761 million increased 67% compared with last year's first quarter, principally reflecting significantly higher incentive fees. The increase also reflected higher average assets under management and the contribution from Ayco. Assets under management increased 10% during the quarter, including net asset inflows of $24 billion, primarily in alternative investment and equity assets, and market appreciation of $15 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets. Although the firm has numerous incentive arrangements, many such arrangements have annual performance periods that end on December 31st. For that reason, fees associated with these incentive arrangements are weighted to the firm's first quarter.

     Securities Services net revenues were $282 million compared with $211 million for the first quarter of 2003, primarily due to higher customer balances in the firm's securities lending and margin lending businesses.
     Operating expenses were $4.00 billion, 26% higher than the first quarter of 2003 and 52% higher than the fourth quarter of 2003.
     Compensation and benefits expenses of $2.96 billion increased 42% compared with the same period last year, commensurate with higher net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50% for the quarter, consistent with last year's first quarter. Employment levels were essentially unchanged during the quarter.
     Non-compensation-related expenses of $1.00 billion decreased 2% compared with the same period last year. Occupancy and depreciation and amortization expenses decreased, primarily due to lower exit costs associated with reductions in the firm's global office space. These exit costs for the first quarter of 2004 were $35 million, compared with $97 million for the first quarter of 2003. These decreases were partially offset by higher brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, primarily reflecting increased volumes in many of the firm's trading businesses. Professional services and other expenses included provisions for a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings of $60 million for the first quarter of 2004, compared with $100 million for the same period last year. Excluding these provisions, professional services and other expenses increased $48 million, principally due to higher levels of business activity.

     The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2004 was 33.0%, up from 32.4% for fiscal year 2003 and down from 35.0% for the first quarter of 2003.
     As of February 27, 2004, total capital was $91.37 billion, consisting of $22.23 billion in shareholders' equity and $69.14 billion in long-term debt. Book value per share was $45.51 based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 488.6 million at period end. Tangible book value per share was $35.38.

     On January 30, 2004, the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the Board) authorized the repurchase of an additional 15.0 million shares of common stock pursuant to the firm's existing share repurchase program. The firm repurchased 4.7 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at an average price of $99.42 per share. The remaining share authorization under the repurchase program, including the newly authorized amount, is 19.4 million shares.
     The Board declared a dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid on May 27, 2004 to common shareholders of record on April 27, 2004.
     On May 10, 2004, approximately 55 million shares of common stock related to the firm's initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent acquisitions, held primarily by people no longer active at the firm, become eligible for sale.
     On June 23, 2004, approximately 44 million shares of common stock related to the firm's IPO and subsequent acquisitions, held primarily by people who are active at the firm, become eligible for sale. In addition, approximately 10 million employee stock options granted at the time of the firm's IPO become exercisable on that date. Substantially all of these shares are subject to compliance with blackout procedures and volume restrictions designed, in part, to facilitate orderly sales.
     As of June 23, 2004, all of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by our former profit participating limited partners and former retired limited partners, and all of the shares deliverable pursuant to equity-based awards granted to employees in connection with the firm's IPO will be eligible for sale.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
     This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2003.
     Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that the firm expects to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2003.
