Annualized return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 26.7% for the second quarter of 2004 and 28.5% for the first half of 2004.

Investment Banking
     Net revenues in Investment Banking were $953 million compared with $659 million for the second quarter of 2003 and $763 million for the first quarter of 2004. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $513 million compared with $258 million for the same period last year, reflecting an increase in client activity. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $440 million compared with $401 million for the same 2003 period, primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide equity and equity-related offerings, partially offset by lower net revenues from debt new issuance activity. The firm's investment banking backlog declined slightly during the quarter.
Trading and Principal Investments
     Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $3.63 billion, 35% above the second quarter of 2003 and 12% below the first quarter of 2004.
     Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) net revenues of $1.89 billion increased 15% compared with the same 2003 period. All major businesses generated strong results in the quarter, although currencies declined from a particularly strong second quarter last year. The business environment was somewhat less favorable compared with the first quarter of 2004 as interest rates increased and credit spreads were volatile.
     Net revenues in Equities of $1.08 billion were essentially unchanged compared with the second quarter of 2003. Net revenues in the firm's equities products group increased, primarily reflecting higher commission volumes in the shares businesses, partially offset by lower net revenues in derivatives, principally due to decreased customer-driven activity. Net revenues in principal strategies were lower compared with last year's second quarter and were significantly lower across most regions and sectors of the business compared with a particularly strong first quarter of 2004.
     Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $657 million, primarily due to an unrealized gain related to the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) of $561 million, as well as gains from other corporate principal investments.

Asset Management and Securities Services
     Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $931 million, 43% above the second quarter of 2003 and 11% below the first quarter of 2004.
     Asset management net revenues of $601 million increased 49% compared with last year's second quarter, primarily due to higher average assets under management, the contribution from Ayco and increased incentive income. During the quarter, assets under management increased $3 billion, reflecting net asset inflows of $9 billion, primarily in alternative investment, equity and fixed income assets, partially offset by market depreciation of $6 billion.
(2)
     Securities Services net revenues of $330 million increased 35% compared with the second quarter of 2003, primarily due to significantly higher customer balances in the firm's securities lending and margin lending businesses.
     Operating expenses were $3.77 billion, 28% higher than the second quarter of 2003 and 6% lower than the first quarter of 2004.
     Compensation and benefits expenses of $2.76 billion increased 38% compared with the same period last year, commensurate with higher net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50% for the first half of 2004, consistent with the first half of 2003. Employment levels were essentially unchanged during the quarter.
     Non-compensation-related expenses of $1.00 billion increased 9% compared with the same period last year, primarily reflecting higher professional services and other expenses, and brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, principally due to increased business activity. These increases were partially offset by lower occupancy and depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily reflecting lower exit costs associated with reductions in the firm's global office space.
     The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2004 was 32.4%, down from 33.0% for the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings. The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2004 was unchanged from fiscal year 2003.
     As of May 28, 2004, total capital was $92.16 billion, consisting of $23.15 billion in shareholders' equity and $69.01 billion in long-term debt. Book value per share was $47.58 based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 486.6 million at period end. Tangible book value per share was $37.48.

     On June 23, 2004, approximately 42 million shares of common stock related to the firm's initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent acquisitions, held primarily by people who are active at the firm, become eligible for sale. In addition, approximately 10 million employee stock options granted at the time of the firm's IPO and in subsequent acquisitions become exercisable on that date. Substantially all of these shares are subject to compliance with blackout procedures and volume restrictions designed, in part, to facilitate orderly sales.
     As of June 23, 2004, all of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by the firm's former profit participating limited partners and the shares deliverable pursuant to equity-based awards granted to employees in connection with the firm's IPO will have become eligible for sale.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
     This Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results, see "Business - Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2003.
     Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that the firm expects to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Business - Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2003.
