Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $890 million compared with $687 million for the third quarter of 2003 and $953 million for the second quarter of 2004. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $451 million compared with $304 million for the same period last year, primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $439 million compared with $383 million for the same 2003 period, due to higher net revenues from debt new issuances and equity underwriting activity, partially offset by lower net revenues from convertible issuances. The firm's investment banking backlog declined during the quarter.
Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $2.70 billion, 15% above the third quarter of 2003 and 26% below the second quarter of 2004. The decline compared with the second quarter of 2004 was primarily due to changes in the fair value of the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG).
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $1.87 billion compared with $879 million for the third quarter of 2003. The increase was primarily driven by strong results in mortgages, commodities, credit products and interest rate products. Results in

currencies were only slightly higher than the difficult third quarter of 2003. Despite a flattening yield curve in the quarter, customer-driven activity in FICC remained generally strong, particularly in commodities, where energy prices generally rose.
Net revenues in Equities of $910 million decreased 17% compared with the third quarter of 2003, as the business operated in a less favorable environment, generally characterized by flat to declining equity prices, further reductions in market volatility and lower customer-driven activity. Results in the firm's principal strategies business declined across most sectors compared with the third quarter of 2003. In addition, net revenues in the firm's equities products group were lower in both shares and derivatives.

Principal Investments recorded negative net revenues of $79 million, primarily due to an unrealized loss of $245 million (as compared with a $561 million unrealized gain in the second quarter of 2004) related to the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of SMFG, partially offset by gains from other corporate and real estate principal investments.
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $941 million, 23% above the third quarter of 2003 and essentially unchanged as compared with the second quarter of 2004.
Asset Management net revenues of $596 million increased 24% compared with last year's third quarter, primarily due to higher average assets under management. During the quarter, assets under management increased $11 billion, reflecting net asset inflows of $10 billion across alternative investment, money market and fixed income assets, as well as market appreciation of $1 billion.
Securities Services net revenues of $345 million increased 21% compared with the third quarter of 2003, primarily due to significantly higher customer balances in the firm's securities lending and margin lending businesses.
Operating expenses were $3.24 billion, 15% higher than the third quarter of 2003 and 14% lower than the second quarter of 2004.
Compensation and benefits expenses of $2.26 billion increased 19% compared with the same period last year, commensurate with higher net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50% for the first nine months of 2004, consistent with the first nine months of 2003. Employment levels increased 4% during the quarter and 4% compared with the end of 2003.
Non-compensation-related expenses of $968 million increased 8% compared with the same period last year, primarily due to higher professional services and other expenses, principally reflecting higher legal and consulting fees.
Table of Contents
The effective income tax rate was 32.3% for the first nine months of 2004, essentially unchanged from the first half of 2004 and fiscal year 2003.
As of August 27, 2004, total capital was $95.19 billion, consisting of $23.51 billion in shareholders' equity and $71.68 billion in long-term debt. Book value per share was $48.08 based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 489.1 million at period end. Tangible book value per share was $38.09.

The firm repurchased 4.8 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at an average price of $89.71 per share. The remaining share authorization under the firm's existing common stock repurchase program is 12.0 million shares.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results, see "Business - Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2003.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that the firm expects to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Business - Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2003.
