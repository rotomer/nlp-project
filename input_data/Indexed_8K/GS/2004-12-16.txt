Full Year
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $3.37 billion for the year, 24% higher than 2003. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $1.74 billion for the year, 45% higher than 2003, primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $1.64 billion, 8% higher than 2003, reflecting a significant increase in industry-wide public common stock offerings and industry-wide initial public offerings. The firm's investment banking backlog increased in the fourth quarter and, at year end, was higher than the end of 2003.

Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $7.32 billion for the year, 31% higher than 2003, primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in credit products and commodities, as well as improved performances in currencies and mortgages. In addition, net revenues in interest rate products were strong, but were lower compared with 2003. During 2004, FICC operated in an environment generally characterized by strong customer-driven activity, rising energy prices, narrow credit spreads and low, although rising, interest rates. The yield curve remained steep in 2004, but flattened in the second half of the year.
Net revenues in Equities were $4.67 billion for the year, 9% higher than 2003, reflecting higher net revenues in the firm's global equities products group, primarily due to increased activity in shares and derivatives. In addition, net revenues were higher in the firm's principal strategies business. During 2004, Equities operated in an environment characterized by improved customer-driven activity, particularly early in the year, and generally higher equity prices. However, volatility levels continued to decline during the year.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $1.33 billion, primarily due to an unrealized gain related to the firm's convertible preferred stock investment in Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) of $771 million as well as gains and overrides from other corporate principal investments.
Fourth Quarter
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $2.88 billion, 10% higher than the fourth quarter of 2003 and 7% higher than the third quarter of 2004.
Net revenues in FICC were $1.46 billion, 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2003, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in commodities as well as increased net revenues in credit products and currencies, partially offset by lower net revenues in interest rate products and mortgages. During the quarter, FICC operated in an environment generally characterized by higher energy prices, trending currency markets and a flattening yield curve.
Net revenues in Equities were $1.03 billion, 12% lower than the fourth quarter of 2003, as the business operated in an environment characterized by further declines in market volatility. Net revenues in the firm's global equities products group decreased across all regions. Net revenues in the firm's principal strategies business were strong, but were lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2003.

Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $3.85 billion for the year, 35% higher than 2003.
Asset Management net revenues were $2.55 billion for the year, 38% higher than 2003, primarily due to higher average assets under management, significantly higher incentive fees and a full year contribution from Ayco . During the year, assets under management increased 21% to $452 billion, reflecting net asset inflows of $52 billion, across all asset classes, as well as market appreciation of $27 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets.
(2)
Securities Services net revenues were $1.30 billion for the year, 29% higher than 2003, primarily due to significantly higher customer balances in securities lending and margin lending.

Asset Management net revenues were $595 million, 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2003, primarily reflecting higher average assets under management. During the quarter, assets under management increased 6%, reflecting market appreciation of $17 billion, primarily in equity assets, as well as net asset inflows of $9 billion across fixed income, alternative investment and equity assets, partially offset by net asset outflows in money markets.
Securities Services net revenues were $339 million, 28% higher than the fourth quarter of 2003, primarily due to significantly higher customer balances in securities lending and margin lending.
Operating expenses were $13.87 billion for 2004, 20% higher than 2003.
Compensation and benefits expenses were $9.59 billion for 2004, 30% higher than the prior year.

Table of Contents
Full Year Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation-related expenses were $4.22 billion for 2004, 4% higher than 2003. Professional services and other expenses included net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $103 million for 2004 compared with $159 million for 2003. Excluding these provisions, professional services and other expenses increased $343 million, primarily due to higher professional fees, increased levels of business activity and higher charitable contributions. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased, reflecting higher transaction volumes in certain of the firm's businesses. Market development costs were also higher, primarily reflecting $62 million in connection with the firm's establishment of a joint venture in China as well as higher levels of business activity.
These increases were partially offset by decreased amortization of identifiable intangible assets, as 2003 included impairment charges of $188 million, as well as lower occupancy and depreciation and amortization expenses. Total exit costs associated with reductions in the firm's global office space, which are included in occupancy and depreciation and amortization expenses, were $41 million for 2004 compared with $153 million for 2003.
Fourth Quarter Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation-related expenses were $1.25 billion, 4% higher than the fourth quarter of 2003 and 29% higher than the third quarter of 2004. The fourth quarter of 2004 included $40 million of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings (included in professional services and other expenses) and $62 million in connection with the firm's joint venture in China (included in market development costs). The fourth quarter of 2003 included $55 million of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and $168 million of impairment charges (included in amortization of identifiable intangible assets).
Excluding these charges, non-compensation expenses increased 17% compared with the same prior year period, primarily due to higher professional services and other expenses, reflecting higher levels of business activity, increased charitable contributions and higher professional fees.
The effective income tax rate for 2004 was 31.8%, down from 32.4% for 2003 and 32.3% for the first nine months of 2004. The change in the effective tax rate for 2004 compared with 2003 reflects a decrease in state and local taxes and the effect of various audit settlements.
As of November 26, 2004, total capital was $105.78 billion, consisting of $25.08 billion in shareholders' equity and $80.70 billion in long-term debt. Book value per share was $50.77 based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 494.0 million at year end. Tangible book value per share was $40.91.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2003.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that the firm expects to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2003.
