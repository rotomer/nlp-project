Item 8.01 Other Events.
On January 25, 2005, the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the "Registrant") authorized the repurchase of an additional 40 million shares of common stock pursuant to the Registrant's existing common stock repurchase program. This repurchase program is intended to substantially offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee equity-based compensation and to help maintain the Registrant's shareholders' equity at appropriate levels. Taking into account the increased authorization, the total remaining authorization under the repurchase program was approximately 41.2 million shares as of January 25, 2005.
