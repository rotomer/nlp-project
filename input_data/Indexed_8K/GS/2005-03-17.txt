Diluted earnings per share were $2.94 compared with $2.50 for the first quarter of 2004 and $2.36 for the fourth quarter of 2004.

Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $893 million, 17% higher than the first quarter of 2004 and 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2004. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $414 million, 15% higher than the first quarter of 2004, primarily reflecting an increase in activity. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $479 million, 19% higher than the first quarter of 2004, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in debt underwriting, primarily due to increased high-yield and bank loan activity, partially offset by lower net revenues in equity underwriting, particularly from convertible issuances. The firm's investment banking backlog increased during the quarter.
Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $4.38 billion, 6% higher than the first quarter of 2004 and 52% higher than the fourth quarter of 2004.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $2.49 billion, 18% higher than the first quarter of 2004, as all major businesses performed well. The increase was driven by significantly higher net revenues in commodities and in credit products (including distressed investing), partially offset by lower net revenues in currencies as compared with a strong first quarter of 2004. Net revenues in interest rate products and mortgages were essentially unchanged compared with the first quarter of 2004. During the quarter,
Table of Contents
FICC operated in an environment generally characterized by strong customer-driven activity, continued volatility in commodity markets, a flattening yield curve and narrow credit spreads.
Net revenues in Equities were $1.55 billion, 7% lower than the first quarter of 2004, but significantly higher than more recent quarters. The firm's principal strategies business performed well, but net revenues were lower compared with a particularly strong first quarter of 2004. Net revenues in the firm's global equities products group were essentially unchanged compared with a strong first quarter of 2004, reflecting higher net revenues in derivatives, offset by lower net revenues in shares and convertibles. During the quarter, the business operated in an environment characterized by solid customer-driven activity, generally higher equity prices and continued low volatility levels.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $344 million, primarily due to an unrealized gain related to the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) of $181 million as well as gains from other corporate and real estate principal investments. Restrictions on the firm's ability to hedge or sell one-third of the common stock underlying its investment in SMFG lapsed in February 2005. As of March 17, 2005, the firm had hedged a majority of these unrestricted shares.
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.13 billion, 8% higher than the first quarter of 2004 and 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2004.
Asset Management net revenues were $749 million, 2% lower than a particularly strong first quarter of 2004. This reflected higher management fees, driven by growth in assets under management, offset by lower incentive fees. During the quarter, assets under management increased 7%, reflecting net asset inflows of $27 billion across all asset classes, as well as market appreciation of $3 billion, primarily in equity and alternative investment assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $380 million, 35% higher than the first quarter of 2004, primarily due to significantly higher customer balances in securities lending and margin lending.
Operating expenses were $4.26 billion, 7% higher than the first quarter of 2004 and 49% higher than the fourth quarter of 2004.
Compensation and benefits expenses were $3.20 billion, 7% higher than the first quarter of 2004, commensurate with higher net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50.0% for the quarter, consistent with last year's first quarter. Employment levels were essentially unchanged during the quarter.

Table of Contents
Non-compensation expenses were $1.06 billion, 5% higher than the first quarter of 2004. Professional fees were higher, reflecting increased legal and consulting fees. Market development expenses and brokerage, clearing and exchange fees also increased, primarily reflecting higher levels of business activity. Other expenses included net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $31 million for the first quarter of 2005 compared with $60 million for the same period last year. Excluding these provisions, other expenses increased $42 million, primarily due to higher levels of business activity and higher expenses from consolidated entities held for investment purposes. These increases were partially offset by lower occupancy and depreciation and amortization expenses, as the first quarter of 2004 included exit costs of $35 million associated with reductions in the firm's global office space.
The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2005 was 29.5%, down from 31.8% for fiscal year 2004 and down from 33.0% for the first quarter of 2004, due to an $80 million net benefit from various audit settlements. Excluding the effect of audit settlements, the effective income tax rate for the quarter would have been 33.3%, up from fiscal year 2004, primarily due to higher tax credits in 2004 and increased state and local taxes in 2005.
As of February 25, 2005, total capital was $121.66 billion, consisting of $26.08 billion in shareholders' equity and $95.58 billion in long-term debt. Book value per share was $53.15 based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 490.6 million at period end. Tangible book value per share was $41.57.

The firm repurchased 11.5 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at an average price of $106.91 per share. The remaining share authorization under the firm's existing common stock repurchase program is 35.0 million shares.
The Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. declared a dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid on May 26, 2005 to common shareholders of record on April 26, 2005.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in Part I, Item 1 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 26, 2004.

Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that the firm expects to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in Part I, Item 1 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 26, 2004.
