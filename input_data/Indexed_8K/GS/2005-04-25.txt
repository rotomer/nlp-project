EXHIBIT 1.1
 
 
April 14, 2005
Goldman, Sachs & Co.,        85 Broad Street,        New York, N.Y. 10004.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
From time to time The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain shares of its Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Shares") (which may be represented by depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares") deposited against delivery of Depositary Receipts (the "Depositary Receipts") evidencing the Depositary Shares that are to be issued by the depositary specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (the "Depositary"), under a deposit agreement, dated the date specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement, among the Company, the Depositary and the holders from time to time of the Depositary Receipts issued thereunder) (the Preferred Shares and the Depositary Shares, if any, representing the Preferred Shares, collectively, the "Shares"). Each Depositary Share will represent beneficial ownership of the fraction of a Preferred Share, as specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement. The Preferred Shares and the Depositary Shares, if any, representing such Preferred Shares specified in such Pricing Agreement, if any, are referred to collectively as the "Firm Shares" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the Preferred Shares represented by such Pricing Agreement are referred to as the shares of "Designated Preferred Shares" with respect to such Pricing Agreement. If specified in such Pricing Agreement, the Company may grant the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election an additional number of Preferred Shares and Depositary Shares, if any, representing such Preferred Shares, specified as
 
provided in such Pricing Agreement as provided in Section 3 hereof (collectively the "Optional Shares"). The Firm Shares and the Optional Shares, if any, which the Underwriters elect to purchase pursuant to Section 3 hereof are herein collectively referred to as the "Designated Shares".
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Shares shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that Goldman, Sachs & Co. may use the Prospectus (as defined below) in connection with offers and sales of the Shares as contemplated in the Prospectus under the caption "Plan of Distribution  Market-Making Resales by Affiliates" ("Secondary Market Transactions"). The Company further acknowledges and agrees that Goldman, Sachs & Co. is under no obligation to effect any Secondary Market Transactions and, if it does so, it may discontinue effecting such transactions at any time without providing any notice to the Company. The term "Underwriter", whenever used in this Agreement, shall include Goldman, Sachs & Co., whether acting in its capacity as an Underwriter or acting in connection with a Secondary Market Transaction, except as may be specifically provided otherwise herein.
1. Particular sales of Designated Shares may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Shares, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Shares in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Shares or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Shares. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Shares and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Shares shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate number of the Firm Shares, the maximum number of Optional Shares, if any, the initial public offering price of such Firm and Optional Shares or the manner of determining such price, the terms of the Designated Shares, including the terms on which and terms of the securities into which the Designated Shares will be convertible or exchangeable, whether the Designated Shares will be represented by Depositary Shares, the name of the Depositary and Date of the Deposit Agreement, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Shares, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Shares, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, the number of such Designated Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter and the commission, if any, payable to the Underwriters with respect thereto and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Firm and Optional Shares, if any, and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in the registration statement and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Shares. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.
2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:

The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Shares under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, the Deposit Agreement, any Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Shares for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey(s); (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Shares; (v) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Shares (other than, in the case of Goldman, Sachs & Co., in any Secondary Market Transactions); (vi) any fees and expenses in connection with listing the Shares; (vii) the cost of preparing certificates for the Shares; (viii) the cost and charges of any transfer agent or registrar or dividend disbursing agent; and (ix) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder and under any Additional Shares Options that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 8 and 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Shares by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
7. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Shares under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares are, at and as of each Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares, true and correct; the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed; and the following additional conditions:
(a) The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to such Designated Shares shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 p.m., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction;
 
(b) Counsel for the Underwriters shall have furnished to the Representatives such written opinion and letter, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares, to the effect set forth in Annex II(a) hereto as well as such other related opinion(s) from counsel, which may include counsel other than counsel for the Underwriters, as the Representatives may reasonably request;
(c) A General Counsel or Associate General Counsel for the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives his or her written opinion, dated each Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares, respectively, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in Annex II(b) hereto;
(d) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Shares at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares and at each Time of Delivery for such Designated Shares, the independent accountants shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of such Pricing Agreement, and a letter, dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex III hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;
(e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Shares;
(f) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock;

on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares or both on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Shares;
(h) If so specified in the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Shares, the Depositary Shares (or, if none, the Preferred Shares) comprising the Designated Shares at each Time of Delivery shall have been duly listed subject to notice of issuance, on the NYSE (or such other exchange or trading facility as may be specified in the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Shares), or application thereto shall have been made;
(i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement; and
(j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at each Time of Delivery for the Designated Shares a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.
8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Shares through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Shares.
provided, however,
 
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Shares, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Shares on the other from the offering of the Designated Shares to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not
 
permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Shares on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Shares in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Shares and not joint.
pro rata
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Firm Shares or Optional Shares which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Shares, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that
 
they have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone a Time of Delivery for such Shares for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Shares.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Shares and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate number of the Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, to be purchased at the respective Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Firm Shares or Optional Shares, as the case may be, of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Firm Shares or the Additional Shares Option relating to such Optional Shares, as the case may be, shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.
 
11. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the indemnity agreement of the Company in subsection (a) of Section 8 hereof, the representations and warranties in subsections (b) and (c) of Section 2 hereof and any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the Registration Statement or any Prospectus contained in any certificate furnished by the Company pursuant to Section 7 hereof, insofar as they may constitute a basis for indemnification for liabilities (other than payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) arising under the Act, shall not extend to the extent of any interest therein of a controlling person or partner of an Underwriter who is a director or officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement or a controlling person of the Company when the Registration Statement has become effective, except in each case to the extent that an interest of such character shall have been determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction as not against public policy as expressed in the Act. Unless in the opinion of counsel for the Company the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, the Company will, if a claim for such indemnification is asserted, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such interest is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
12. If any Pricing Agreement or Additional Shares Option shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Shares or Optional Shares with respect to which such Pricing Agreement or Additional Shares Option shall have been terminated, except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, Designated Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Shares, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Shares except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Shares shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly, by Goldman Sachs & Co. on behalf of such Underwriters or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Treasury Department; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
provided
however
14. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors
 
and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
18. The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) related to those benefits, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us counterparts hereof.

Goldman, Sachs & Co.,        As Representatives of the        Several Underwriters,               c/o Goldman, Sachs & Co.,                      85 Broad Street                             New York, New York 10004.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We refer to the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement, dated  - , 20... (the "Pricing Agreement"), between The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of            [depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each representing one            of a share of] [Title of Preferred Shares] (the "[Preferred] Shares"). [The Depositary Shares are being issued pursuant a deposit agreement (the "Deposit Agreement"), dated as of            , 20    , between the Company and            , as depositary (the "Depositary"). The Preferred Shares and the Depositary Shares representing the Preferred Shares, collectively, are herein called the "Shares". The Depositary Shares are evidenced by depositary receipts ("Depositary Receipts") issued pursuant to the Deposit Agreement.] In connection with the several purchases described above, we, as counsel for the several Underwriters, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, we advise you that, in our opinion:
(1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

Goldman, Sachs & Co.,        As Representatives of the        Several Underwriters,               c/o Goldman, Sachs & Co.,                      85 Broad Street                             New York, New York 10004.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and offering of           [depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each representing one            of a share of] [Title of Preferred Shares] (the "[Preferred] Shares") of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the "Company"). [The Depositary Shares are being issued pursuant a deposit agreement (the "Deposit Agreement"), dated as of            , 20    , between the Company and                      , as depositary (the "Depositary"). The Preferred Shares and the Depositary Shares representing the Preferred Shares, collectively, are herein called the "Shares".] The two Registration Statements relating to the Shares (File Nos. 333-112367 and 333-122977) were filed on different dates on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution.
The Shares have been offered by the Prospectus dated March 15, 2005 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated ......., .... (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Basic Prospectus. The Basic Prospectus is contained in the second Registration Statement and, pursuant to Rule 429 under the Act, may be used in connection with the securities covered by both Registration Statements. The Basic Prospectus as so supplemented does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission which contain information as of various dates.
In accordance with our understanding with you as to the scope of our services under the circumstances applicable to the offering of the Shares, we reviewed the Registration Statements, the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its counsel and its accountants and advised you as to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its counsel and its accountants in which the contents of certain portions of the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, and certain related matters were discussed, and we reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, an opinion of [a][an Associate] General Counsel of the Company and a letter from the Company's independent accountants delivered to you in connection with the offering of the Shares.
On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of the prospectus contemplated
 
thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Act, we advised you and now confirm that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statements, when such part became effective, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Shares, to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Shares, any part of any of the Registration Statements, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Shares, the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Also, nothing that has come to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the last sentence of the prior paragraph has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Shares, the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date and time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In addition, we do not know of any litigation or any governmental proceeding instituted or threatened against the Company that would be required to be disclosed in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, and is not so disclosed. We call to your attention, however, the fact that the Company has an internal legal department and that, while we represent the Company on a regular basis, our engagement has been limited to specific matters as to which we were consulted by the Company and, accordingly, our knowledge with respect to litigation and governmental proceedings instituted or threatened against the Company is similarly limited. Also, insofar as the offering of the Shares is concerned, we do not know of any documents that, as of the date and time of delivery of this letter, are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statements and are not so filed.
The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statements, the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement except for those made under the captions "Description of Preferred Stock We May Offer", ["Description of Preferred Stock We May OfferFractional or Multiple Shares of Preferred Stock Issued as Depositary Shares",] "Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance" and "Plan of Distribution" in the Basic Prospectus and "Specific Terms of the Notes" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions, therein described, of the Shares[, the Deposit Agreement under which the Shares are being issued] and the Pricing and Underwriting Agreements relating to the Shares. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statements, the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement.
We, as counsel for the several Underwriters, are furnishing this letter to you, as Representative of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Shares. This letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person (including persons acquiring the Shares from the Underwriters) or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.
 
ANNEX II(b)
(1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware;
(2) This Agreement, the Pricing Agreement and the Deposit Agreement with respect to the Designated Shares have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; and
(3) The Preferred Shares have been duly authorized.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, such counsel has relied upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials and other sources believed by such counsel to be responsible; and that such counsel has assumed that the Deposit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Depositary, that the certificate for the Preferred Shares conforms to the specimen thereof examined by such counsel (or members of the Company's legal department acting under such counsel's supervision) and has been duly countersigned by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar of the Preferred Shares, and that the signatures on all documents examined by such counsel (or members of the Company's legal department acting under such counsel's supervision) are genuine, assumptions that such counsel has not independently verified. In addition, such counsel may state that such counsel has examined, or has caused members of the Company's legal department to examine, such corporate and partnership records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as such counsel has considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of such opinion.
