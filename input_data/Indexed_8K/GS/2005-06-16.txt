Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $815 million, 14% lower than the second quarter of 2004 and 9% lower than the first quarter of 2005. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $386 million, 25% lower than the second quarter of 2004, reflecting a decrease in completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $429 million, 3% lower than the second quarter of 2004, reflecting lower net revenues in equity underwriting, primarily due to a decrease in industry-wide equity and equity-related offerings, partially offset by higher net revenues in debt underwriting, primarily due to an increase in bank loan and mortgage activity. The firm's investment banking backlog increased during the quarter.
Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $2.81 billion, 22% lower than the second quarter of 2004 and 36% lower than the first quarter of 2005.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $1.52 billion, 20% lower than the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to lower net revenues in credit products, interest rate products and commodities. In addition, mortgages performed well, although net revenues were lower compared with the second quarter of 2004, while net revenues in

currencies improved. During the second quarter, trading conditions were less favorable than more recent quarters, as markets generally lacked direction. In addition, credit markets weakened and the U.S. yield curve continued to flatten.
Net revenues in Equities were $1.11 billion, 3% higher than the second quarter of 2004, primarily reflecting higher net revenues in the firm's principal strategies business, partially offset by lower net revenues in the firm's customer franchise businesses, particularly in convertibles. During the quarter, the business operated in an environment characterized by generally lower equity prices and continued low market volatility.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $189 million, primarily due to $107 million in gains from corporate and real estate principal investments and a $73 million gain related to the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG).
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.18 billion, 27% higher than the second quarter of 2004 and 4% higher than the first quarter of 2005.
Asset Management net revenues were $689 million, 15% higher than the second quarter of 2004, reflecting higher management fees, driven by growth in assets under management, partially offset by lower incentive fees. During the quarter, assets under management increased 2%, reflecting net asset inflows of $10 billion, primarily in fixed income, alternative investment and equity assets, partially offset by market depreciation of $2 billion, primarily in equity assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $489 million, 48% higher than the second quarter of 2004, as our prime brokerage business continued to perform well, reflecting higher global customer balances in securities lending and margin lending as well as seasonally higher activity levels in Europe.
Operating expenses were $3.56 billion, 6% lower than the second quarter of 2004 and 16% lower than the first quarter of 2005.
Compensation Expenses
Compensation and benefits expenses were $2.40 billion, 13% lower than the second quarter of 2004, commensurate with lower net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50.0% for the first half of 2005, consistent with the first half of 2004. Employment levels were essentially unchanged during the quarter.

Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $1.16 billion, 16% higher than the second quarter of 2004. Other expenses increased primarily due to higher expenses of consolidated entities held for investment purposes and higher levels of business activity. Occupancy expenses were higher and included $16 million of real estate exit costs associated with the relocation of office space. Professional fees were higher, reflecting increased consulting and legal fees. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees increased, reflecting higher transaction volumes in certain of the firm's businesses. Market development costs also increased, primarily due to higher levels of business activity. Excluding non-compensation expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes , non-compensation expenses were 11% higher than the second quarter of 2004 and 7% higher than the first quarter of 2005.
(3)
Provision For Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2005 was 29.9%, up from 29.5% for the first quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of audit settlements in 2005, the effective income tax rate for the first half of 2005 would have been 33.1%, down from 33.3% for the first quarter of 2005 and up from 31.8% for fiscal year 2004. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first half of 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to lower tax credits and increased state and local taxes in 2005.
As of May 27, 2005, total capital was $121.53 billion, consisting of $26.40 billion in total shareholders' equity (common equity of $25.65 billion and preferred equity of $750 million) and $95.13 billion in long-term debt. Book value per common share was $53.46 based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 479.7 million at period end. Tangible book value per common share was $41.46.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in Part I, Item 1 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 26, 2004.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that the firm expects to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Business  Certain Factors That May Affect Our Business" in Part I, Item 1 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 26, 2004.
