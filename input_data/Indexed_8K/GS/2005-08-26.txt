Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          On August 23, 2005, Goldman Sachs Headquarters LLC ("Headquarters"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the "Registrant"), entered into a Ground Lease, as tenant, with Battery Park City Authority, as landlord (the "Lease"). The Lease grants to Headquarters a leasehold interest in a parcel of land designated as Site 26 (the "Site"), within Battery Park City in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, and has a 64-year term.
          Headquarters currently intends to construct on the Site an office building of approximately 2.1 million gross square feet, at a projected cost of approximately $2.3 to $2.5 billion. It is anticipated that construction will begin late 2005, with initial occupancy scheduled for 2009.
          A copy of the Lease is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
          This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the Registrant's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Registrant's control. It is possible that the actual construction schedule and size and cost of the building may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated schedule, size and costs. Important factors that could affect the proposed construction schedule and size and cost of the building include the timing of governmental approvals, increases in the cost of building materials and construction costs generally, shortages, or delays in the delivery, of materials, strikes, work stoppages and other similar events and changes in the scope and nature of the Registrant's business, as well as the number of the Registrant's employees.

          (c) Within thirty (30) days after the date on which the City Council of the City of New York (or any successor governmental agency) shall fix the tax rate applicable to real property comparable to the Premises and situated in the Borough of Manhattan, Tenant shall advise Landlord of its calculation of the PILOT for the forthcoming Tax Year, including a specification of the same in reasonable detail, pursuant to hereof. In the event that the City Council of the City of New York (or any successor governmental agency) shall not have fixed the tax rate for any Tax Year on or before the fifteenth day of the final month of the immediately preceding Tax Year and, therefore, Tenant shall be unable to calculate the PILOT for such Tax Year prior to the commencement of such Tax Year, Tenant shall pay semi-annually (by the date PILOT is due under hereof), as estimated PILOT (the ""), an amount equal to the amount required to be paid under this Article on account of PILOT for the second half of the preceding Tax Year. Within ten (10) days after the date on which the City Council of the City of New York shall fix the tax rate, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount (""), if any, by which PILOT properly payable for the portion of such Tax Year in respect of which Tenant previously paid Estimated PILOT exceeds the amount of such Estimated PILOT. In the event that the amount of such Estimated PILOT shall exceed the amount of PILOT properly payable for the portion of the Tax Year in respect of which Tenant previously paid such Estimated PILOT, Tenant may credit such excess against (and deduct such excess from) future semi-annual payments of PILOT during such Tax Year, and to the extent if any, that the amount of Tenant's credit exceeds the next semi-annual installment of PILOT or if the semi-annual payments of PILOT for such Tax Year have been fully paid, Tenant may credit and deduct the amount of the excess from the semi-annual payments of PILOT payable with respect to the next Tax Year(s). Within sixty (60) days after the date on which Tenant shall have advised Landlord of its calculation of PILOT or Corrected PILOT, as the case may be, for a given Tax Year, Landlord shall advise Tenant as to whether Landlord agrees with Tenant's calculation, with a reasonably detailed statement as to the basis of any disagreement. If Landlord shall advise Tenant that Landlord agrees with Tenant's calculation or if Landlord shall fail to advise Tenant of its determination within such sixty (60)-day period, Tenant's calculation shall be the basis for PILOT for that Tax Year (except to the extent that any of (i) one or more of the factors employed in determining the Capped PILOT, (ii) the applicable tax rate, (iii) the AV of the Land for such Tax Year, (iv) the AV of the Building for such Tax Year or (v) the Exemption Base (collectively, the "") change or thereafter are finally determined or become known to Tenant and thereby result in a change, or allow Tenant to better calculate, PILOT). If Landlord shall advise Tenant that it disagrees with Tenant's calculation and shall have delivered such reasonably detailed statement as the
Section 3.02(b)

PILOT Elements
 
basis therefor, Landlord's calculation shall be the basis for PILOT for that Tax Year (except to the extent that any of the PILOT Elements change or thereafter are finally determined or become known to Tenant or Landlord and thereby result in a change, or allow Tenant or Landlord to better calculate, PILOT), unless within twenty (20) days after Landlord's advice to Tenant, Tenant shall notify Landlord of its disagreement with Landlord's calculation with a reasonably detailed statement as to the basis of any disagreement, in which event Tenant shall pay PILOT in accordance with Landlord's calculation pending resolution of the dispute. If such dispute shall determine that (i) Tenant overpaid PILOT, then Tenant shall be entitled to a credit against the next installment of PILOT together with interest thereon at the Prime Rate from the date of the overpayment by Tenant until the date on which Tenant applies such credits (and if the Expiration Date shall occur (other than as a result of an Event of Default by Tenant hereunder) prior to Tenant's ability to apply such credit, then Landlord shall pay the unapplied amount of such credit to Tenant, not later than the Expiration Date, together with interest as aforesaid), or (ii) Tenant underpaid PILOT, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord within ten (10) days after the date of the determination a sum equal to the amount of such underpayment together with interest thereon at the Involuntary Rate from the date of the underpayment by Tenant until the date on which Tenant remits payment to Landlord. If any PILOT Element in respect of a period for which PILOT has already been paid by Tenant shall change and thereby result in a change in PILOT, then (i) if Tenant overpaid PILOT, then Tenant shall be entitled to a credit against the next installment of PILOT together with interest thereon at the Prime Rate from the date of the overpayment by Tenant until the date on which Tenant applies such credits (and if the Expiration Date shall occur prior to Tenant's ability to apply such credit, then Landlord shall pay the unapplied amount of such credit to Tenant, not later than the Expiration Date, together with interest as aforesaid), or (ii) if Tenant underpaid PILOT, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord a sum equal to the amount of such underpayment together with interest thereon at the Prime Rate from the date of the underpayment by Tenant until the date on which Tenant remits payment to Landlord.
          (d) Tenant shall continue to pay the full amount of PILOT required under this , notwithstanding that Tenant may have instituted tax assessment reduction or other actions or proceedings pursuant to hereof to reduce the assessed valuation of the Premises or any portion thereof. If any such tax reduction or other action or proceeding applicable to any Tax Year shall result in a final determination in Tenant's favor or other settlement in reduction of such assessment, (i) Tenant shall be entitled to a credit against future PILOT to the extent, if any, that the PILOT previously paid for the Tax Year for which such final determination was made exceeds the PILOT as so determined; and (ii) if such final determination is made for the then current Tax Year, future payments of PILOT for said Tax Year shall be based on the PILOT as so determined. If, at the time Tenant is entitled to receive such a credit, the City of New York is paying interest on refunds of Taxes, Tenant's credit shall include interest at the rate and for the applicable period then being paid by the City of New York. Tenant shall
Section 3.02
Section 4.06
 
be entitled to a refund from Landlord for (A) any credit hereunder which remains unused as of the Expiration Date or (B) any such excess determined after the Expiration Date, in each case less any amounts then owed to Landlord by Tenant hereunder and that the Expiration Date does not occur by reason of an Event of Default hereunder.
provided
          (e) If Tenant shall obtain a reduction in the tax assessment for any Tax Year, Tenant shall not be entitled to any credit described in unless within one year of the date of the final determination or settlement reducing said assessment Tenant shall have notified Landlord of such determination, with proof of the date of final determination accompanying any such notice. For the purposes of this , the "date of the final determination" shall mean: (x) in the case of an assessment reduction as a result of an accepted offer of reduction by the Tax Commission of the City of New York, the date the acceptance of the Tax Commission offer is filed, or (y) in the case of an assessment reduction pursuant to a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction after trial and/or appeal, the date of the entry of such order. The provisions of this shall apply notwithstanding that any other law, rule or regulation would permit a longer or shorter period of time within which Tenant may apply for a refund or credit resulting from the reduction of real property tax assessments.

In implementing the provisions of this section, the contracting agency shall consider the number and types of minority and women-owned business enterprises located in the region in which the state contract is to be performed, the total dollar value of the state contract, the scope of work to be performed and the project size and term. If, based on such considerations, the contracting agency determines there is not a reasonable availability of contractors on the list of certified business to furnish services for the project, it shall issue a waiver of compliance to the contractor. In making such determination, the contracting agency shall first consider the availability of other business enterprises located in the region and shall thereafter consider the financial ability of minority and women-owned businesses located outsider the region in which the contract is to be performed to perform the state contract.
     6. For purposes of determining a contractor's good faith effort to comply with the requirements of this section or to be entitled to a waiver therefrom the contracting agency shall consider:

The contractor shall serve a copy of such complaint upon the contracting agency by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested.

          (a) Tenant shall (with respect to its own Contracts), and shall use its Best Efforts to cause its Contractors to, make a search for Minorities and women for employment in the Construction of the Project.
Exhibit C-8
 
          (b) Tenant shall (with respect to its own Contracts), and shall use its Best Efforts to cause its Contractors to, encourage Minority and women employees to recruit other Minorities and women for employment on the Project.
          (c) Tenant shall (with respect to its own Contracts), and shall use its Best Efforts to cause its Contractors to, fulfill its/their Minority and women workforce participation obligations under above in a substantially uniform manner throughout the Construction of the Project.
Section 3(a)
          (d) Tenant shall not (with respect to its own Contracts), and shall use its Best Efforts to cause its Contractors not to transfer Minority and women employees from employer to employer or project to project for the purpose of meeting Tenant's and Contractors' obligations hereunder.
          (e) Tenant shall meet with BPCA and such other persons as BPCA may invite, on a periodic basis as required by BPCA, to discuss issues relating to Minority and Women Workforce Participation. At such meetings Tenant shall report on the names of its Contractors then engaged in construction on the Project or which within 60 days are scheduled to be engaged in construction on the Project, on the nature of the work and anticipated construction schedule of such Contractors, on the anticipated hiring needs of such Contractors, on the names of the responsible foremen for each of the construction trades directly employed by such Contractors, and such other information reasonably requested by BPCA that will promote the employment of Minorities and women. Tenant shall use its Best Efforts to obtain the above information from its Contractors and shall, upon BPCA's request, use its Best Efforts to cause its Contractors to attend said meetings and provide the above information.
          (f) Tenant shall monitor all of its Contractor's compliance with the foregoing obligations are complied with by each Contractor.
          (g) Tenant shall (with respect to its own Contracts), and shall use its Best Efforts to cause its Contractors to, consult with BPCA regarding fulfillment of its obligations hereunder prior to solicitation for any contractors, subcontractors, or consultant.

Section 4
     5. . A business enterprise which is a Certified MBE or a Certified WBE is an eligible MBE or WBE and shall remain an eligible MBE or WBE for so long as such business continues to be a Certified MBE or Certified WBE. Except as otherwise set forth below, Certification as an MBE or WBE shall be the sole and conclusive determination of eligibility for the purposes of this Program. BPCA will rely on a determination with respect to MBE or WBE certification of, or failure to certify, a business
Determination of MBE and WBE Eligibility
Exhibit C-9
 
enterprise as an eligible MBE or WBE made by the Division or its successor or other designated New York State certifying agency, office or authority pursuant Article 15A of the New York State Executive Law, or any guidelines or regulations issued thereunder, or any other or successor applicable law, or regulations or executive order. At Tenant's request, BPCA shall assist Tenant in Certifying a business it believes is a qualified candidate for Certification, including using its Best Efforts to expedite Certification. If a business is not MBE or WBE Certified at the time the Contract is awarded, but thereafter becomes a Certified MBE or WBE, the entire Contract amount shall be deemed as awarded to a Certified MBE or WBE. If a business is not MBE or WBE Certified at the time Contract is awarded and its application to the State for Certification is rejected for whatever reason, BPCA may, in its sole discretion, still consider the Contract as awarded to an MBE or WBE and the award amount shall be counted under this Affirmative Action Program provided that such rejection is not based, in whole or in part, on a determination that such MBE or WBE is not a bona fide MBE or WBE as defined by the State of New York pursuant to Article 15A of the New York State Executive Law and any guidelines or regulations issued thereunder. Although Certification enables eligibility for this Program, there are other factors which Tenant may take into consideration in determining appropriateness of an eligible MBE or WBE's participation in the Project, including, but not limited to, financial stability.
     6. . Tenant shall (with respect to its own Contracts), and when contemplated by the applicable Contract bid package, shall use its Best Efforts to cause its Contractors to, provide meaningful participation in Contracts for the Project to MBEs and WBEs, provided that such obligation shall be deemed to have been fulfilled when the aggregate Contract Value of Approved MBE Contracts and Approved WBE Contracts shall equal twenty-five percent (25%) of Total Development CostsIn determining the aggregate Contract Value of Approved MBE and WBE Contracts, an amount equal to the Contract Value of all Contracts for which BPCA (or the arbitrators or Director) has issued waivers to Tenant or its Contractors pursuant to Section 313, subsections 5, 6, 7 & 8, and Section 316 of the Executive Law, shall be included as part of the aggregate Contract Value for the purpose of fulfillment of Tenant's and Contractors' obligation under this Program, including obligations under , below and all other provisions relating to Tenant's and Contractors' MBE and WBE obligations as may be set forth herein.

MBE/WBE Participation Procedures
Section 6
          (a) Tenant shall advise BPCA promptly of Tenant's proposed design and construction schedule for the Project and afford BPCA's Affirmative Action Officer a reasonable opportunity to become familiar with the proposed scope, nature and scheduling of Tenant's major Contracts. Tenant shall furnish BPCA with a projected schedule which shall include a detailed description (the "") of such Contracts, broken down by trade. Tenant will update or amend the Contract Schedule as required to reflect any changes in Tenant's proposed Contracts and will promptly notify BPCA thereof. The Contract Schedule will set forth the anticipated times at which invitations to bid or requests for proposals are to be issued for work in each trade and the general scope of such work. In formulating the Contract Schedule, Tenant will confer with the BPCA Affirmative Action Officer to identify those portions of the work or purchases which can be divided into separate contract packages or which can be subcontracted, so as to maximize opportunities for participation in the work by MBEs and WBEs. To the extent practicable and at the sole discretion of the Tenant, Tenant shall prepare separate contract packages for such work which shall be bid and let separately by Tenant or which shall be subcontracted separately by Tenant's Contractors, and shall not be bid or let as part of any other work. Tenant shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of an invitation or request to bid for each individual contract, furnish BPCA with written notice thereof.
Contract Schedule
          (b) Tenant acknowledges that BPCA has provided to it a list of eligible MBEs and WBEs for portions of the Construction of the Project. In general, an MBE or WBE will be deemed to be qualified to perform work if, among other things, the Tenant determines (i) its personnel have successfully performed work of a similar nature in the past; (ii) it can demonstrate the present ability to organize, supervise and perform work of the kind and quality contemplated for the Project; (iii) it is financially stable; and (iv) it is able to pass the Tenant's background and integrity check process. In determining whether an MBE or WBE meets these
Exhibit C-11
 
standards, Tenant shall consider; among other things, experience in the trade, technical competence, organizational and supervisory ability and general management capacity.
          (c) For each request for proposal or invitation to bid, Tenant shall compile a bidders list. Each bidders list shall contain MBEs and WBEs deemed qualified by Tenant in accordance with , unless there are no qualified MBE's or WBE's as further stated below. Prior to issuing the request for proposal or invitation to bid, Tenant shall confer with BPCA regarding MBE and WBE participation and if an MBE and WBE included on the list sent by BPCA has been found not to be qualified, Tenant shall inform BPCA as to the reasons for such determination. BPCA may provide the names any additional eligible MBE and WBE firms which may be qualified to perform the specific work associated with the request for proposal or invitation to bid. In the event BPCA provides additional MBE and/or WBE firms, Tenant shall perform due diligence as to their qualifications and availability to perform the work. If Tenant finds that the MBE and/or WBE is qualified and available to perform the work, said firm(s) shall be added to the bidders list. If Tenant finds that the MBE and/or WBE is not qualified or available to perform the work, Tenant shall advise BPCA and inform BPCA as to the reasons for such determination. BPCA acknowledges that if Tenant's due diligence elicits no qualified or available MBE or WBEs for a particular bid package, the finalized bidders list shall not contain an MBE or WBE and the value of the specific Contract will be deemed Exempt as defined herein. Tenant shall invite a reasonable number of MBEs and WBEs which Tenant finds qualified and available hereunder (including those MBEs and WBEs on the list provided by BPCA pursuant to above which Tenant finds qualified) to submit proposals for work required to be performed under Tenant's Contract packages (including both Contracts and subcontracts). BPCA shall acknowledge in writing in a prompt manner that it has conferred with Tenant regarding the bidders list for each trade.

Tenant shall also maintain at its offices complete and accurate written copies of all Contracts and amendments, including Approved MBE Contracts and Approved WBE Contracts, awarded on the Project. Such Contracts and amendments may be reviewed by BPCA at Tenant's offices at such times as BPCA may reasonably request and shall be governed by the Confidentiality provisions set forth in the Lease. After award of a Contract, Tenant shall notify the BPCA Affirmative Action Officer of any modification or amendment of such Contract which will materially reduce or increase the scope of work to be performed by an
Exhibit C-12
 
MBE or WBE or materially diminish or increase the Contract Price of any Contract (including Subcontracts) awarded to an MBE or WBE. Each Contract entered into by Tenant after the date of the Lease shall (i) contain such non-discrimination provisions as are required by the Lease, (ii) require the Contractor thereunder to comply with the applicable Minority and Women Workforce Requirements of , and the procedures set forth in , of this Program and (iii) require such Contractor to comply with the applicable provisions of and of this Program with respect to any Contracts awarded by such Contractor. Tenant shall promptly furnish the BPCA Affirmative Action Officer with the name of each party to whom Tenant (or its Contractors) awards a Contract, together with, in the case of each Approved MBE Contract or Approved WBE Contract, a summary of the scope of services to be performed under such Contract and the Contract price thereof, as the same may be amended from time to time.

          (g) Tenant shall, within ninety (90) days after Construction of the Project, provide a statement to BPCA of Tenant's Total Development Costs, certified by Tenant and a Certified Public Accountant, listing in reasonable detail the components thereof. Within ninety (90) days after receipt of such statement, BPCA may cause a firm of independent Certified Public Accountants selected jointly by BPCA and Tenant to examine and audit the records, account books and other data of Tenant used as the basis for such certified statement, and be informed as to the same by a representative of Tenant, all of which Tenant shall make available to BPCA. If such audit shall establish that the Total Development Costs were understated, then the Total Development Costs shall be increased accordingly. The audit, if any, shall be conducted at the expense of BPCA unless it shall be established that Tenant understated the Total Development Costs by more than three and one-half percent (3 and /%), in which case Tenant shall pay the reasonable cost of BPCA's audit. If any items of Total Development Costs are not yet determined at the time of completion of the Construction of the Project (for example, costs of tenant improvements not yet completed or paid for), Tenant may make one or more supplemental submissions of such additional Total Development Cost items, and such items shall be subject to audit by BPCA as provided in this .

Minority and Women Business Enterprise Workshops
Exhibit C-13
 
to schedule a series of workshops in an attempt to maximize MBE and WBE participation in the Construction of the Project. The primary objective of such workshops is to schedule pre-bid meetings and provide assistance to MBEs and WBEs interested in bidding in their respective trades and to stimulate potential joint ventures, subcontracts and supply and vendor opportunities. The workshops shall include the use of private and public sector business resources to provide construction-related and office assistance to MBEs and WBEs in the following categories: (1) contract procurement; (2) technical matters; (3) estimating; (4) payment requisition preparation; (5) personnel evaluation; (6) computer technology; and (6) new business opportunities.
     10. .
Non-Compliance
          (a) Tenant acknowledges that the percentages of Minority and Women Workforce Participation set forth in Section 3(a) above, and the work and Contract Value thereof set forth in , represent reasonable estimates of Tenant's ability to provide meaningful participation to Minority and women workers and MBEs and WBEs, respectively, during the Construction of the Project. Tenant recognizes and acknowledges that the purpose of this Program and of Tenant's and BPCA's undertakings hereunder is to fulfill BPCA's statutory obligations in connection with the Construction of the Project by affording Minority and women workers and MBEs and WBEs an opportunity to participate in the Construction of, and Contracts for, the Project, to the end that such Minority and women workers and MBEs and WBEs can share in economic benefits and also can gain necessary training, experience and other benefits which will facilitate their full participation in the construction industry and management and operation of projects hereafter. Consistent with Section 313 of the Executive Law, BPCA acknowledges that the failure to reach the goals set forth in and above does not by itself mean that Tenant has failed to use its Best Efforts. Tenant recognizes and acknowledges that its failure to use its Best Efforts to achieve the goals set forth in and above, or comply with the procedures set forth in and above, with respect to the utilization of Minority and women workers and MBEs and WBEs in the Construction of, and Contracts for, the Project may result in damage to BPCA's affirmative action programs and policies, as well as to Minority and women workers and MBEs and WBEs who would be denied an opportunity to share in the economic benefits provided by the construction work and would be denied the training, experience and other benefits which participation in the Project would provide. Tenant further recognizes and acknowledges that such damage cannot be readily quantified, but that the amounts set forth below are reasonable in light of the magnitude of the harm which would result from non-compliance by it hereunder, other than to a extent, and that payments made for the purposes of the Minority Workers Training Fund and Women Workers Training Fund and the MBE Assistance Fund and WBE Assistance Fund, referred to in below, are a reasonable means of compensating for that harm.

If Tenant and Landlord give such notice to Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver to Successor Agent all Materials in Escrow Agent's possession or thereafter received by Escrow Agent. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
     6. Escrow Agent may elect to resign hereunder and terminate this Agreement by giving Landlord and Tenant ninety (90) days' notice of such resignation and termination. If, during such 90 day-period, Tenant notifies Escrow Agent that Tenant has appointed a Successor Agent reasonably acceptable to Landlord, then Escrow Agent shall deliver to such Successor Agent all Materials in Escrow Agent's possession or thereafter received by Escrow Agent and Escrow Agent shall have no further obligations under this Agreement.

This Guaranty is one of payment and not of collection.
          2. As used herein, the term "Guaranteed Obligations" means the obligations and liabilities, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, of Goldman Sachs Headquarters LLC, a limited liability company wholly owned by the Guarantor and duly formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Company"), to Battery Park City Authority (the "Landlord"), in the event of a contest by the Company pursuant to:
          [Section 4.05 of the Lease, to pay to Landlord or the party entitled thereto the amount of such Imposition or part thereof as finally determined in such proceedings, the payment of which may have been deferred during the prosecution of such proceedings, together with any costs, fees (including attorney's fees and disbursements), interest, penalties or other liabilities in connection therewith] or
          [Section 14.02 of the Lease, to pay to Landlord or the party entitled thereto the amount necessary to comply with such Requirements or part thereof as finally determined, together with any costs, fees (including attorney's fees and disbursements), interest, penalties or other liabilities in connection therewith] or
          [Section 16.02 of the Lease, to pay to Landlord or the party entitled thereto the amount of such lien or part thereof as finally determined, together with any costs, fees (including attorney's fees and disbursements), interest, penalties or other liabilities in connection therewith] or

          3. The Guarantor agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel) incurred in the enforcement or protection of the rights of Landlord in connection with a breach by the Company of the Guaranteed Obligations or, to the extent incurred after demand under this Guaranty has been made and not timely honored, in connection with a breach of this Guaranty by the Guarantor.
          4. Landlord shall not be obligated as a condition precedent to performance under this Guaranty to proceed against the Company under the Lease or otherwise or against any mortgagee, guarantor or other person or collateral, before making a claim or collecting under this Guaranty, or to file any claim relating to the obligations owing to it if the Company becomes subject to an Insolvency Event (as hereinafter defined), and failure of Landlord to so proceed or file shall not affect the Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty.
          5. The Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty are absolute and unconditional, primary and irrevocable, and independent of the obligations of the Company, and shall not be limited, discharged, deferred or otherwise affected by any lack of validity, legality or enforceability of, or the voidability of, the Guaranteed Obligation, the Lease or any other agreement or instrument evidencing the Guaranteed Obligation or by the validity, enforceability, perfection or existence of any collateral therefor or by any other circumstance relating to any Guaranteed Obligation insofar as the same would otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defense of a guarantor or surety, including without limitation, any of the following;

          e. any change, restructuring or termination of the structure or existence of the Company.
          in each case, whether occurring before or after any default by the Company under the Lease, and with or without further notice to or assent from the Guarantor.

The Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally waives the following: (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and of any change in the financial condition of the Company; (b) notice of any obligation or liability to which it may apply; (c) promptness, diligence, presentment, demand for payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (d) protest, notice of dishonor, notice of default and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and/or this Guaranty; (e) notice of any suit or the taking of other action by Landlord against, and any other notice to, the Company, the Guarantor or others; (f) the right to interpose all substantive and procedural defenses of the law of guaranty, indemnification and suretyship; (g) any rights and remedies accorded by applicable law specifically to guarantors or sureties, including, without being limited to, any extension of time conferred by any law now or hereafter in effect; (h) the right to assert in any proceeding for the enforcement of this Guaranty as against Landlord any set-off or counterclaims, except for any compulsory counterclaim; or (i) any right or claim of right to cause a marshaling of the assets of the Company or to cause Landlord to proceed against the Company and/or any collateral or security held by Landlord at any time or in any particular order.
          7. Landlord may enforce and protect any and all the obligations and liabilities of the Guarantor by suit in equity or action at law. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to Landlord or allowed it by law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by Landlord at any time or from time to time.
          8. Landlord may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder compromise or subordinate any Guaranteed Obligation, including any security therefor.
          9. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants as follows:
          a. The Guarantor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Guarantor has the corporate power and authority to own its property and assets, to carry on its business as now being conducted by it and to execute, deliver and perform the Guaranty.
Exhibit F  3
 
          b. The execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Guarantor.
          c. The execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty will not violate or conflict with any provision of law or any order of any court or agency of government or the organizational documents of the Guarantor, or any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Guarantor is a party or by which it or any of its property is subject to or bound, or be in conflict with or result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice and/or lapse of time) a default under any such indenture, agreement or other instrument, in each case insofar as such violation, conflict, breach or default would adversely affect Landlord's rights or impair the Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty.
          d. All authorizations, consents and approvals of governmental bodies or agencies necessary for the due execution and delivery of this Guaranty or in connection with the performance of the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder have been obtained.
          e. This Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, moratorium or insolvency or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general rules of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in an action at law or a proceeding in equity).
          f. The Guarantor further agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment in respect of, or any part thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or interest thereon, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Landlord or any other recipient of such payment upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition, dissolution, receivership, conservatorship, winding up or other similar proceeding (any of the foregoing, an "Insolvency Event") involving or affecting the Company. If at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon an Insolvency Event involving or affecting the Company, the Guarantor's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had not been made.
          g. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts or other obligations which constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by, or required to be performed by, the Company under the Lease but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of an Insolvency Event involving or affecting the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Guarantor's obligation to make payment or otherwise perform in accordance with this Guaranty nor any remedy for the enforcement thereof shall be impaired, modified, changed, stayed, released or limited in any manner by any impairment, modification, change, release, limitation or
Exhibit F  4
 
stay of the liability of the Company or its estate in bankruptcy or any remedy for the enforcement thereof, resulting from the operation of any present or future provision of the United States bankruptcy laws or other statute or from the decision of any court interpreting any of the same.
          10. This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of Landlord and its successors and assigns and shall be binding upon the successors of the Guarantor. The Guarantor may not assign its rights nor delegate its obligations under this Guaranty, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of Landlord, which may be withheld in Landlord's sole discretion, and any purported assignment or delegation absent such consent is void, except for an assignment and delegation of all of the Guarantor's rights and obligations hereunder to a partnership, corporation, trust or other organization in whatever form that succeeds to all or substantially all of the Guarantor's assets and business and that assumes such obligations by contract or operation of law. Upon any such delegation and assumption of obligations and the confirmation thereof by the successor entity or assignee in an writing reasonably acceptable to Landlord, the Guarantor shall be relieved of and fully discharged from all obligations hereunder, whether such obligations arose before or after such assumption.
          11.

Please find attached a term sheet and a series of attachments resulting from discussions representatives of the State and City have had with your staff regarding the possibility of Goldman Sachs returning to Battery Park City's Site 26. It is our hope that the terms herein described are responsive to the issues which we believe to be of concern to Goldman Sachs. These include transportation, security, economic incentives, and construction concerns.
Should Goldman Sachs give favorable consideration to the terms as described in these documents, the State and City shall work with your staff to develop the necessary documentation to commemorate the terms of the transaction, as soon as possible.
We are available at your convenience to discuss any of these matters further.
 
Attachments to Proposal:
 
 
 
August 4, 2005
Construction and design work:
The Secretary to the Governor will personally establish and maintain hands-on involvement in every aspect of project development, to ensure its favorable completion.
The Secretary to the Governor, in conjunction with the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center (LMCCC), shall put in place a customized procedure to expedite approval of all construction and design work, including the attached Design Approval Procedures.
Real Estate Tax:
The Battery Park City Authority and the City shall commit that the PILOT on Goldman development at Site 26 shall not exceed 115% (replacing the previously negotiated 130% PILOT formula, but subject to the same term) of the average PILOTs (as finally determined on a per gross square foot basis) at the World Financial center, including the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Most Favored nation status:
The Battery Park City Authority (and the City, as its successor) shall offer to match for Goldman Sachs the terms of any subsequent lease extensions and/or purchase rights offered to tenants on the other BPCA sites.
If additional as-of-right economic or tax incentives, credits, savings, abatements or other benefits ("New Lower Manhattan Incentives") are made available to tenants or developers (but not to Goldman Sachs at Site 26) in the World Trade Center area (including 7 WTC and World Financial Center, but excluding Freedom Tower), after the date hereof through 2012 (excluding Lower Manhattan Incentive legislation passed by the State Legislature in the 2005 Legislative session (Bill S. 5930) and any related chapter amendments as of this date (the "2005 Lower Manhattan Incentives Legislation")). The City, State and BPCA will offer or provide additional benefits to Goldman Sachs to the extent necessary to ensure that such additional benefits, together with discretionary and as-of-right benefits already available to Goldman Sachs at Site 26, are equivalent to the New Lower Manhattan Incentives (as calculated using consistent methodologies). The Ground Lease will provide that to the extent that the City and State shall not otherwise provide Goldman Sachs with an additional $6 million benefit, either in the form of a commercial rent occupancy tax abatement (under the 2005 Lower Manhattan Incentives Legislation, as amended, or otherwise) or another credit, then
 
August 4, 2005
Goldman Sachs shall be permitted to credit such amount against its PILOT obligations, together with interest thereon at the rate of 7.75 percent per annum until fully recovered (but that in no event is it intended that Goldman Sachs should have the benefit of both such $6 million credit and the CRT abatement under the 2005 Lower Manhattan Incentives Legislation and if the same occurs, Goldman Sachs will repay the second of such amounts realized).
Headcount Requirements:
The calculation of headcount commitments for economic incentives shall permit Goldman Sachs to include up to 65 percent of contract employees toward the headcount (without a requirement to establish their full-time status), subject to a 20% limitation on the number of contract employees and full-time equivalent employees that may be included in the annual headcount. Should Goldman Sachs fall below the headcount commitments for any duration of time, they shall be given a 90-day period to cure such default.
Upon a sale of a portion(s) of Goldman Sachs, its headcount, employment growth and occupancy commitments (but not its headquarters or designated operations and facilities), and the discretionary benefits described in the project agreement between NYCEDC and Goldman Sachs, shall be ratably adjusted.
The terrorism-related provisions of the NYCEDC project agreement will be modified such that the "Multiplier Factor" shall not be used for purposes of calculating benefits recapture amounts to be paid by Goldman.
Liberty Bonds:
The State and City shall make available and approve, as necessary, $1.65 Billion in Liberty Bonds for the project, subject to applicable federal criteria for eligible project costs. The State and City shall support issuances in tranches if Goldman Sachs requests, subject to Goldman Sachs' satisfaction of only ministerial conditions.
If Goldman Sachs moves its corporate headquarters from the site prior to the fifth anniversary of substantial completion, or otherwise breaches any of the other commitments in the Liberty Bond project agreement so as to trigger liquidated damages under the project agreement between Liberty Development Corporation (LDC) and Goldman Sachs, said damages shall be, in the aggregate, 35 basis points per annum (so long as default is continuing) multiplied by the outstanding principle amount with a cap of $60 million. Goldman Sachs will also commit in the LDC project agreement not to relocate its headquarters for so long as the Liberty Bonds are outstanding, but Goldman
 
August 4, 2005
Sachs' sole liability for doing so (except as described in the preceding sentence) shall be as set forth in the NYCEDC project agreement.
LDC shall not be required to approve any amendments or waivers granted by the Battery Park City Authority (BPCA) in favor of Goldman Sachs regarding the ground lease. However, it is expected that BPCA will consult with LDC prior to agreeing to amendments to ensure conformity with federal and IRS provisions.
Inasmuch as the Liberty Bonds are not expected to be issued prior to the execution and delivery of the Ground Lease and other documents (but rather four to six weeks thereafter), all of said documents shall be expressly conditioned on the issuance of Liberty Bonds on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise as previously agreed upon and the failure to effect such issuance (other than as a result of an abandonment of the issuance by Goldman Sachs) shall render said documents null and void.
Sales Tax:
The Ground Lease will provide to Goldman Sachs sales tax benefits for core and shell costs and eligible fit-out costs (including non-fixture fit out, technology and furnishings) and amounts not otherwise provided by law through the fourth year of initial occupancy of the improvements on Site 26 (beginning with construction commencement). We do not expect the value of the sales tax benefits to exceed $60 million, which amount is exclusive of amounts to which Goldman Sachs may be entitled on account of its earned "Growth Credits" under the NYCEDC project agreement. Such benefits shall not be subject to recapture or forfeiture under said project agreement.
Vesey Street Entrance; Logistics Plan:
The Battery Park City Authority shall not require Goldman Sachs to create an entrance to its building from Vesey Street.
Battery Park City Authority has approved the Logistics Plan (included in the attached NYSDOT Right of Entry Agreement).
Work Rules:
The Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center shall commit to working with Goldman Sachs to develop a set of appropriate work rules, consistent with a "fast track construction process" without regard to historical practice of BPCA, including the attached Work Rules. Appeals shall be made to LMCCC within three days.
 
August 4, 2005
MWBE:
Minority- and women-owned business involvement shall account for 25% of the cost associated with the building's core and shell (excluding "Exempt" and "Proprietary" work), after the date of execution of the ground lease, subject to and in accordance with the attached MWBE Program (and related sample report). We would encourage and expect Goldman Sachs to establish a pilot program to ensure appropriate levels of minority participation in the construction workforce.
Green Building Standards:
A LEEDS Gold standard for the building shall be sufficient to meet BPCA's green building requirements.
Environmental Remediation:
BPCA shall deliver a clean site, with any required environmental remediation to be performed by either BPCA or, at Goldman Sachs' election, Goldman Sachs. Should Goldman Sachs perform the remediation, BPCA will fund all such work up to $1 million, and shall not withhold reasonable approval of the contractor.
Designation and Access:
Concurrently herewith, BPCA will execute and deliver the Designation Letter Extension and the Access Letter, the latter of which provides Goldman Sachs with 2 free months of access to the site on the terms set forth therein.
Escrows and Milestones:
The State and the City commit to entering into a MOU to establish that the physical and security treatments, as described in documents attached hereto, shall be put in place as described and as scheduled in said documents. In lieu of an MOU, the State, the City, BPCA and Goldman Sachs will implement directly into the other documentation for the transaction (such as the ground lease) the terms set forth in this section "Escrows and Milestones."
The MOU (or the documentation) shall provide for an exemption for sales tax payments for tenant improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and shall further provide for (i) Goldman Sachs' payment into an escrow (the "Sales Tax Escrow") of the sales tax amounts that would otherwise have been due (but excluding, and after receipt by Goldman Sachs of, amounts to which Goldman Sachs is entitled in connection with the
 
August 4, 2005
sales tax exemption described above in "Sales Tax" and entitled on account of Growth Credits under the NYCEDC project agreement) and (ii) BPCA's deposit into an escrow (the "Ground Lease Payments Escrow") of ground lease payments made by Goldman Sachs.
The Sales Tax Escrow shall be payable to the State and the City if prior to December 31, 2009 (which date may be extended to not later than March 31, 2010, as long as the public parties are proceeding with all necessary diligence to complete the construction of the Specific Downtown Projects and/or the development and implementation of the Plan as described in clauses (i) and (ii) below):
     (i) the Specific Downtown Projects for Construction (per the attached schedule labeled "Specific Downtown Projects (Construction Milestone Schedule)") shall have been completed; and
     (ii) the Plan (as defined in the attached letter from James K. Kallstrom to Edward C. Forst, dated July 27, 2005 (the "Kallstrom Letter"), which Plan shall be deemed supplemented for purposes of this proposal by the letter from Raymond W. Kelly to Edward C. Forst, dated July 21, 2005) shall have been developed and implemented in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Kallstrom Letter.
The Sales Tax Escrow shall be payable to Goldman Sachs (i) if as of December 31, 2009 (as the same may be extended in accordance with the parenthetical above with respect to the Specific Downtown Projects), the Specific Downtown Projects shall have not been completed, or (ii) if prior to such date, the State shall have taken an action that would frustrate such completion by such date or shall have taken any action with respect to any Specific Downtown Project that is contrary to the agreements set forth herein or in any of the attachments hereto.
The Sales Tax Escrow shall also be payable to Goldman Sachs if the Plan is not developed or implemented in accordance with said procedures or on or prior to December 31, 2009 (as the same may be extended in accordance with the parenthetical above with respect to the Plan).
The Ground Lease Payments Escrow shall be payable to the City if the portions of the Plan that are the City's responsibility are developed and implemented in accordance with the procedures and within the time requirements set forth in the Kallstrom Letter and in no event later than December 31, 2009 (which date may be extended to not later than March 31, 2010, as long as the City is proceeding with all necessary diligence to the development and implementation of such portions of the Plan).
 
August 4, 2005
The Ground Lease Payments Escrow shall be payable to Goldman Sachs if any portion of the Plan which is the City's responsibility to develop and implement is not developed or implemented in accordance with the procedures or within said time requirements set forth in the Kallstrom Letter and in no event later than December 31, 2009 (as the same may be extended in accordance with the parenthetical in the immediately preceding paragraph), or if the City takes any action that frustrates the development and implementation of any other component of the Plan in accordance with the foregoing.
The City acknowledges that the City's responsibilities and obligations in respect of the Plan are in many respects indivisible from the obligations of the State in respect of the Plan and require the cooperation and participation of the City and the New York City Police Department with the State and other relevant governmental agencies.
The dates and time requirements referred to in the preceding paragraphs in this section "Escrows and Milestones" shall be subject to force majeure events, but otherwise, time shall be of the essence with respect to the dates set forth herein).
     "Force majeure" means:
 
August 4, 2005
Goldman Sachs will have the right to utilize the sales tax exemption for the remaining term of the ground lease without requirement that it make payments into the escrow accounts for purchases (up to a maximum equivalent to the then-present value of $160 million on January 1, 2006, using the City's discount rate), which benefits shall not be subject to recapture or forfeiture under the NYCEDC project agreement, subsequent to the occurrence of those events that result (or, had they occurred later, would have resulted) in the payment of the Sales Tax Escrow to Goldman Sachs.
If all or any portion of work listed as items A, C, D, G and H of the Specific Downtown Projects are not completed, or the Plan is not developed and implemented, in either case by December 31, 2009, or if all or any portion of work listed as items B and F of the Specific Downtown Projects are not completed by December 31, 2010, then (in addition to its right to the escrowed amounts as described above) Goldman Sachs will be relieved of its commitments under the NYCEDC project agreement and the LDC project agreement (without forfeiture or recapture obligations).
In addition, HRPT or LMDC shall deposit into an escrow account (the "HRPT Escrow") an amount equal to the construction costs for improvements within HRPT property west of the western curb of the Lay-by Lane similar to those improvements constructed by or on behalf of HRPT in similar areas in Hudson River Park (the "Base Amount"), estimated to be $5 million. Said amounts shall be disbursed to Goldman Sachs as it constructs said improvements as contemplated in Exhibit 3 of the Hudson River Park Trust Permit attached hereto.
Electricity:
 
August 4, 2005
Site 26 shall be provided, at Gold Sachs's option, 5 megawatts of peak demand [9am-5pm] electricity otherwise allocated to the WTC, on the same discounted rate basis as provided to WTC.
Self-insurance:
Goldman Sachs may exercise its right to self insure in an amount not to exceed the lesser of (1) $350 mm (adjusted by CPI) and (ii) 15% of the annual average of Goldman Sachs's pre-tax earnings over the previous eight fiscal quarters.
Extension of Time Commitments:
Each deadline or commencement date for Goldman Sachs's performance shall be extended by one year plus, if the documents are not executed and delivered by November 5, 2005, one day for each day after November 1, 2005 until the documents are executed and delivered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pilot Commencement Date shall be changed from July 1, 2006, to July 1, 2007, only if The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. does not create assessable building infrastructure at the Project Premises (PILOT) prior to January 5, 2006; otherwise, it shall be the July 1st following the first taxable status date on which the New York City Department of Finance assesses building infrastructure improvements at the project premises (PILOT).
Constitutionality of Benefits:
If any economic incentives are ruled unconstitutional, then the City and State governments shall use their best efforts to provide such economic incentives in a constitutional manner subject to Goldman maintaining its commitments under the NYCEDC Project Agreement. If notwithstanding such efforts, the incentives cannot be so provided, then Goldman Sachs may elect either (i) to be relieved of its commitments under NYCEDC and LDC project agreements upon repayment of any benefits (multiplied by the applicable "Recapture Percentage") that have been realized by Goldman Sachs, (except Goldman Sachs shall still be liable for any forfeiture payments or liquidated damages for which it became liable prior to such ruling), upon which election any future benefits not found unconstitutional in such ruling shall be permanently forfeited, or (ii) to maintain its commitments under the NYCEDC Project Agreement and continue to enjoy any future benefits not found to be unconstitutional in such ruling, subject to (x) pro-ration based on loss of benefits of its headcount commitment with respect to "Non-Relocation Reductions", employment growth and occupancy commitments and (y) with respect to "Relocation Reductions", increasing each buffer percentage used to determine benefits recapture payment obligations by an amount equal to such percentage multiplied by the percentage of benefits determined to
 
August 4, 2005
be unconstitutional and not otherwise replaced by the City and State, provided that if 10% or more of the benefits are ruled unconstitutional and not otherwise replaced by the City and State, then no recapture payments shall be applicable until there shall have been a Relocation Reduction of 7% or more (as such percentage shall be increased by the calculation provided for above in this clause (y)).
Ferry Landing Rights:
The Port Authority will use best efforts (and the State will use its best efforts to have the Port Authority use its best efforts), consistent with the existing agreement with the current ferry landing operator:
     (i) to make arrangements with such operator to provide to Goldman Sachs, upon Goldman Sachs' written request, access to and landing rights at such ferry landings (including appropriate landing and slip spaces, and processing and waiting areas). to accommodate ferry services by or on behalf of Goldman Sachs, and
     (ii) to have such access and landing rights provided by the operator on non-discriminatory and commercially reasonable terms comparable to the terms on which access and landing rights are provided to other entities operating like ferry services.
NYC Comptroller Approval:
The City and State understand that a condition to Goldman Sachs' proceeding with the transaction is that the City and State obtain, not later than the close of business August 10, 2005, the approval of the New York City Comptroller to all of the terms of the proposed transaction, including those set forth herein and in the attachments hereto, and the City and State will use reasonable good faith efforts to obtain such approval by such date.
Elevation of Security-Related Disputes:
If Goldman Sachs has a dispute with the State or City regarding any aspect of the security for Site 26 or the WTC Site and environs, then, within ten (10) business days after Goldman Sachs' request, the Governor or Mayor, or both (as applicable), shall meet with Goldman Sachs' Chief Executive Officer to discuss and attempt to resolve such dispute.
Perimeter Security  Bollards:
 
August 4, 2005
With regard to bollard placement, Goldman Sachs, HRPT, the City, the State, NYSDOT, NYCDOT and BPCA acknowledge and agree to the provisions set forth in the attached "Perimeter Security  Bollards Statement."
 
Draft of August 8, 2005
Perimeter Security  Bollards
With regard to bollard placement, GS, HRPT, the State, NYSDOT and BPCA acknowledge and agree as follows (and the City does not object to the agreements made hereinbelow):
 
Draft of August 8, 2005
Performance standards for bollards at Site 26 are based on Department of State specifications SD-SDT-0201.
At high speed approaches to the property, K12/L3 bollards/barriers will be required. These bollards/barriers are tested and certified by Department of State to stop a vehicle weighing 15,000 lbs traveling at 50 mph with no more penetration than 3 ft (capable of absorbing 1.7 mega joules of energy). The K12/L3 bollards will be used the entire length of West Street, following the curb of Route 9-A, and will also turn the corners at West Street along both Vesey Street and Murray Street (with the bollards to be set back to accommodate pedestrian and bicycle curb cuts as discussed) for approximately 80' west of each corner.
At lower speed approaches to the property, K8/L3 bollards/barriers will be required. These bollards/barriers are tested and certified by Department of State to stop a vehicle weighing 15,000 lbs traveling at 40 mph with no more penetration than 3 ft (capable of absorbing 1.1 mega joules of energy). The K8/L3 bollards will be used from approximately 80' west of the corner(s) at West Street (where the K12/L3 bollard zone ends) along Vesey Street and Murray Street and will continue west along the balance of the perimeter.
To meet the specifications for energy absorption, the actual bollards will have a diameter, and height, and be spaced a distance apart, that conforms to the K12/L3 and K8/L3 standards. Those standards and dimensions are in accordance with Department of State standards and the available below grade engineering requirements.
 
Mr. Timur Galen Managing Director Goldman, Sachs & Co. 85 Broad Street New York, NY 10004
Dear Mr. Galen:
     I have summarized below the agreements we have reached over the last several very productive weeks for our further discussion. Underlying all our agreements is our mutual belief that redevelopment of Lower Manhattan must include high quality design features that ensure a respectful setting for the World Trade Center (WTC) Memorial and the creation of a "pedestrian precinct" by developing a promenade which will itself be an attractive destination point. The Route 9A/West Street pedestrian precinct will provide a distinctly different experience for pedestrians and motorists from Chambers Street to Battery Place than that of Route 9A/West Street north of Chambers Street. This will be accomplished by adherence to design principles outlined in this letter and implementation of different lighting, crosswalk, curb and planting strategies than practiced north of Chambers Street. The Route 9A/West Street pedestrian precinct will strengthen the east west pedestrian connection across Route 9A/West Street and better connect Battery Park City and the Hudson River Park to their neighbors on the east side of Route 9A/West Street. As discussed below, many of these principles can be agreed to now. Others will require approval of the Federal Highway Administration and/or City and State agencies that can only be obtained as the design is progressed. This letter will indicate which strategies we can commit to at this time and the process for resolution of outstanding issues.
Statement of design intent
 
access to the Hudson River Park and waterfront, strengthen the connection between the financial district and Battery Park City, support the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan, and support a vibrant multi-use community.
     NYSDOT recognizes that the promenade must reflect the varied nature of the surrounding neighborhoods from the residential and recreational uses north of Murray Street, to the premium office building district from Murray to Liberty, the WTC Memorial, the quality residential properties in Battery Park City south of Liberty and the mixed used buildings south of Liberty on the east side of the promenade. NYSDOT, in conjunction with you and other stakeholders in Lower Manhattan, will address these distinctive environments through the following:
     The intent is to provide continuity along the promenade while ensuring that individual urban spaces can have unique characteristics conforming to their surrounding environments. Such treatments would, for example, ensure that the urban design treatments used in front of Site 26 smoothly transition to the treatments used in front of the World Financial Center. Exhibit A discusses particular treatments that we will implement provided and to the extent we are able to obtain the requisite coordination and agreement of governmental and private stakeholders, which is outlined on Exhibit A and which we undertake to achieve.
Specific Agreements
 
 
          I look forward to continued progress towards resolving any remaining issues.
Sincerely,
/s/ Timothy J. Gilchrist Timothy J. Gilchrist Director Office of Downstate Transportation Strategy
 
Exhibit A
LIGHTING:
:
TREES/LANDSCAPE PLAN
BPCA, NYSDOT, HRPT, and NYCDOT have approved the landscape design plan submitted by Goldman Sachs, with the understanding that the final landscape design along Vesey Street will be consistent with the landscape design previously submitted, with the following exceptions:
Goldman Sachs shall be responsible for the installation, maintenance and replacement of any London Plane trees planted on the West Street side of Site 26. The London Plane trees proposed in Goldman Sachs' landscape design are significantly taller, and have different maintenance requirements, than other trees in Hudson River Park, and are a species not recommended by the Hudson River Park Trust.
.
PAVEMENT/NOISE
BOLLARDS/TRAFFIC BARRIERS ALONG WEST SIDE OF ROAD:
NYSDOT is willing at Goldman Sachs request to fabricate a 30" high stone wall edge for Route 9A/West Street. If Goldman Sachs desires to utilize bollards instead, NYSDOT has approved the use of bollard's subject to the other provisions of the Perimeter Security Bollards Statement delivered herewith and subject to the following conditions:

(A) Term:
The Term of the Permit and any extensions thereof.
(B) Construction of the Improvements on the Premises:
(1) At or around substantial completion of Permittee's construction of the building at Site 26, or upon sooner requisition by Permittee evidencing expenditures, the Trust shall pay Permittee such funds, known as the "Base Amount", in accordance with the terms of the Escrow [as defined in the Memorandum of Understanding, dated as of the date of the Permit (the "MOU"), between The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Permittee and various public agencies regarding the development of Site 26]. Such Base Amount shall be applied to the construction of improvements on the Premises, including without limitation, streetscapes and landscapes, according to the design plan (the "Design Plan") provided by Permittee to the Trust, so Permittee or its subcontractors may construct such improvements on the Premises according to the Design Plan. The Trust's obligations pursuant to this paragraph may be satisfied by the release of funds from the Escrow.
(2) The improvements to be constructed on the Premises will be rated at least the same class of construction as similar improvements located in Battery Park City ("BPCA Rating"), Permittee may opt, at its sole discretion, to construct improvements on the Premises that are rated a higher class than the BPCA Rating, if Permittee reasonably determines that a higher standard is typical for world headquarter facilities of similarly-situated financial institutions. Permittee shall be responsible for any costs in excess of the Base Amount incurred in constructing such improvements.
(3) The Base Amount is not intended to be applied to the construction of any improvements located east of the western curb of the lay-by lane to be constructed at Site 26 (such improvements, "Street Improvements").

Re:    World Trade Center Site and Environs Security Plan
Dear Mr. Forst:
     The World Trade Center Redevelopment Agreement, dated November 24, 2004 between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the City of New York, among other items, provides that the Port Authority and the City will develop a mutually acceptable Security Plan for the World Trade Center (WTC) Site. (That agreement is attached hereto as Attachment A.)
     On May 12, 2005, Governor George Pataki called upon Mr. John Cahill, Secretary to the Governor, to coordinate the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment effort. As his Senior Advisor for Counter-Terrorism, I was identified by the Governor to coordinate the security interests and activities of the various public sector and private entities that are participants in the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan. Part of that task has been to develop the necessary security protocols with the City of New York, and specifically, the New York City Police Department as a principal stakeholder in this effort.
     To develop these protocols, we are in the process of acquiring the services of a Security Consultant to prepare and assist in the implementation of a Site-Wide World Trade Center All Hazards and Risks Master Security Plan and Standards, with a Concept of Operations, Operational Procedures, and Functional Requirements (the "Plan"). The Plan will encompass and coordinate all aspects and components of security for the WTC Site, related entities and proximal environs, from security design, through construction and completion, to occupancy, and operations. It will identify all security components that will impact the redevelopment of the WTC Site and recommend long-term security measures and procedures that will be integrated with the proximal environs, and Lower Manhattan. In developing the Plan, the Consultant will be collaborating with the various agencies and other public and private stakeholders performing the design and
 
construction for the WTC Site to ensure the full integration of proposed security measures with these efforts, however, the Security Consultant is not being tasked to modify the design or structural elements of the buildings or the WTC Site. A security strategy, and security measures with technical, physical, operational, and functional requirements necessary to implement the recommended strategy and measures throughout the affected area, will be included in the Plan. It will address mitigations that provide appropriate levels of protection against all hazards and risks. It is the intention of the State to seek an allocation of appropriate funds to ensure the implementation of the final, approved Plan.
     Further, it is the State's expectation that, given the history of the WTC Site, possessing as it does security concerns unlike any other location in the United States and representing a fulcrum of national remembrance, pride and resolve, that there will be a Federal commitment to the security of the WTC Site. This will be manifest in the providing of direct support as necessary, as well as intelligence information in a relevant and timely fashion. While this additional Federal support will be an important benefit to our efforts, nevertheless, the State agrees that any inability ultimately to attain such support will not affect the State's commitments as set forth herein.
     As stated above, and as its title clearly indicates, the Plan will encompass the full range of protective systems components, equipment, staffing, construction and operational procedures. The Plan will take into account the interdependencies of the entities involved in the WTC Site redevelopment and the proximal environs and include input form all stakeholders.
     Security-related pedestrian and vehicle traffic management pertaining to the WTC Site will be accomplished pursuant to the above-referenced World Trade Center Redevelopment Agreement.
     The incident management and response plans that emerge will be fully coordinated with the City of New York, LMDC, the Port Authority (including the Port Authority Police Department and PATH), LMCCC, the New York City Police and Fire Departments, the New York State and New York City Departments of Transportation, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority/New York City Transit (MTA/NYCT), the affiliates of Silverstein Properties Inc., WTC Retail LLC, the WTC Trade Center Memorial Foundation, and other stakeholders in the environs and mesh with all appropriate response protocols. Such plans will give due attention to maintaining and/or re-establishing viable access for the conduct of stakeholders' business in the environs as appropriate. Command and control will be facilitated at a security operations center that includes participation in, and two-way communication with the relevant stakeholders.
     The best available effective technologies will be selected to support the full range of security access, surveillance, detection, communications, intelligence and other security systems.
     The State of New York, the City of New York, the Port Authority, the Metropolitan Transit Authority and the New York City Police Department are closely cooperating in the development of the Plan. Such cooperation ensures that the Plan will be fully inclusive of the security concerns within the area. As the Plan develops, these concerns will be
 
considered prior to the implementation of the agreed security protocols that will be derived from the Plan. We fully recognize that multiple stakeholders in Lower Manhattan have vested interests in the security methods that will result from this effort, and we are committed to having those stakeholders participate and have a significant and meaningful role in interactive working groups that contribute to the development of the Plan. That same process will continue throughout the Plan's implementation, and provide for continued information sharing and consultation and ongoing evaluation of the Plan's implementation and effectiveness and proposed modifications to the Plan.
         You are requested to identify one or more appropriate individual(s) of your organization who will be available to participate fully throughout this process which will include participation as indicated in the below timeline and milestone sequence. The following timeline will commence with the transmittal of a Notice to Proceed to the selected consultant, currently anticipated to occur on or about August 17, 2005. The timeline will start from this date as follows:
         Your participation will commence with a meeting to be held on the afternoon of August 3, 2005 to begin the vendor selection process. Your representatives' full participation in the activities described in the above milestones is expected to be only a portion of such individuals' broader and more comprehensive involvement in many aspects of the development, implementation and ongoing evaluation and modification of the Plan.
         As you and selected members of your team are aware from prior briefings, the Freedom Tower will be constructed to very high standards. The standards to which the Freedom Tower will be built were set forth in detail at a briefing provided to you by the State and attended by the New York City Police Department on June 28, 2005. In addition, these standards are consistent with recommendations of the "Freedom Tower Security Assessment & Recommendations," dated April 8, 2005, issued by the New York City Police Department, which detailed the design threat for vehicular-borne attack. All other buildings on the Site will be constructed to the high standards discussed.
 
     In summary, both the State and City of New York are synchronized and committed to establishing and implementing, in concert with the other involved public and private stakeholders, security standards, plans and operations for the WTC Site and proximal environs in the manner described above. We look forward to your active participation in this process.
Enclosure
 
Excerpt from WORLD TRADE CENTER REDEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT entered November 24, 2004 between the Port Authority and the City of New York:
The following streets and sidewalks shall be designed and constructed by the Port Authority to such standards that meet the requirements of the City Department of Transportation ("DOT") taking into account any modifications to such requirements as would be necessary to effectuate the Security Plan (as hereafter defined) (i) Vesey (ii) Fulton (iii) Dey (iv) Cortlandt (v) Liberty (vi) Church, if Church is required to be constructed, (vii) Greenwich, and if the WTC Site is extended southward, (viii) Cedar. The parties agree that all material sidewalk design elements, including but not limited to: geometry, grades, drainage, signs and markings, lighting, sidewalks, curb cuts and any parking meters or other city paid parking devices, if included, shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties and that the parties will consult with LMDC, or its designee, the Silverstein Net Lessees, the Retail Net Lessees and any WTC hotel lessee or operator on the design and implementation of such material sidewalk elements.
Article Two  subparagraph (d) 
The parties agree that it shall be the responsibility of the City to operate and manage the streets and sidewalks, including traffic patterns and flows, subject to the Security Plan. The Port Authority or its designee shall be responsible for the maintenance of all sidewalks. The City and the Port Authority will mutually agree on all issues relating to curb usage and agree to consult with LMDC, or its designee, any Silverstein Net Lessee, Retail Net Lessee and any WTC Hotel lessee or operator on curb usage issues in front of any building or area leased by any of the aforementioned parties. The City agrees to consult with the Port Authority, LMDC or the designee and any affected Silverstein Net Lessee, Retail Net Lessee or any WTC Hotel lessee or operator on any decisions that will permanently and materially affect vehicular and pedestrian traffic in and through the WTC Site. The City will promptly review and process all requests for street closing permits from the Port Authority, LMDC or its designee, the Silverstein Net Lessees, the Retail Net Lessee and any WTC Hotel lessee or operator, required to facilitate the construction and/or maintenance of all at-grade and below-grade infrastructure at the WTC Site. Notwithstanding the foregoing the parties have agreed to certain street widths and street grades as stated in the WTC Design and Site Plan Agreement and set forth on .
Article Two  subparagraph (f) 
Appendix C
The parties recognize that if the Security Plan closes any additional streets within or adjacent to the WTC Site to vehicular traffic, that traffic flows throughout lower Manhattan will be affected. Accordingly, the parties agree that if any such streets are closed to vehicular traffic for security purposes, the parties will revisit the traffic flow patterns on the other streets in and adjacent to the WTC Site to insure a proper flow of vehicular traffic in and through the WTC Site.
Article Two  subparagraph (g) 
Security at the WTC Site shall be governed by an agreed-upon security plan acceptable to the City and the Port Authority (the "Security Plan"). When adopted, the Security Plan will supersede any existing Memoranda of Understanding between the City and the Port Authority addressing security issues, but only as to the WTC Site. Insofar as possible, consistent with security needs, the Security Plan shall seek to ensure that heightened security measures do not result in undue impacts on the WTC Site or the immediate surroundings. The City and the Port Authority agree to consult with LMDC or its designee, the Silverstein Net Lessees, the Retail Net Lessee and the WTC Hotel owner or operator in the adoption of the Security Plan.
Article Five  subparagraph (a) 
 
Edward C. Forst Executive Vice President Chief Administrative Officer Goldman Sachs 85 Broad Street New York, New York 10004
Dear Mr. Forst:
As you know from our previous discussions, the NYPD is committed to the development and implementation of a comprehensive security plan for Lower Manhattan.
Our security plan for Lower Manhattan will address a wide range of issues, including optimal command, control and communication, street and traffic management and other operational issues, area wide security monitoring and the use of technology.
The Port Authority is also working on the development of a security plan for the World Trade Center site. The NYPD is working with the Port Authority and other State agencies to ensure that this effort is seamlessly integrated into the overall Lower Manhattan security plan.
We recognize that Goldman Sachs, as well as other relevant stakeholders, should be included in this process. In fact, the security plan will be based on the outline of such a plan already shared with Goldman Sachs. We also invite Goldman Sachs to provide a liaison that would be available for all security planning work.
One component of the plan will be a centralized coordination center that will provide space for full-time, on site representation from Goldman Sachs and other stakeholders. This will ensure maximum communication and coordination in case of any event.
We look forward to discussing this further.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
          You have requested permission for access by you, your affiliates and your contractors and agents to Site 26 in Battery Park City (the "Premises") prior to the execution of a ground lease (the "Lease") for the Premises with Battery Park City Authority ("BPCA") for the purpose of performing the work described below (the "Work") in connection with a proposed new headquarters and trading facility to be constructed by you. BPCA agrees to permit such access, subject to the following conditions:
The term of your access to the Premises pursuant to this Letter Agreement shall commence upon such date as you may specify by written notice to BPCA (such date, the "Access Commencement Date") and shall expire upon the earliest to occur of (a) the expiration or earlier termination of the letter agreement, dated as of September 7, 2004, between you and BPCA (as amended and reinstated by the Designation Letter Reinstatement and Amendment, of even date herewith, between you and BPCA, the "Designation Letter"), (b) the effective date of the Lease between you and BPCA in respect of the Premises (in which case your right of access shall be governed by said Lease), and (c) your termination of your right of access pursuant to this Letter Agreement, which you may elect at any time on written notice to BPCA (such earliest date, the "Access Termination Date").

Landscape Design for Site 26 ("the Project") Battery Park City, New York
Dear Timur:
We have received, reviewed and approved Goldman Sachs' landscape design as contained in the Goldman Sachs' Design Development Submission of February 11, 2005, for the Project. This approval provides for future potential revisions to aspects of the design including the interface of bicyclists and pedestrians at the corner of Vasey Street and West Street. This approval is given with the understanding that Goldman Sachs shall be responsible for the installation, maintenance and replacement of any London Plane trees planted on the West Street side of Site 26.
All parties recognize that the issue and location of bollards is being addressed in a separate document attached to this proposal.

Dear Timur:
The landscape drawings dated January 27, 2005 and submitted yesterday by Doug Blais of the Governor's office are conceptually approved. We understand that you will submit detailed drawings at a later date for our review. As that time, we would expect you to address the following issues:
Plans should be dimensioned and labeled, particularly sidewalks and entrances so conflicts can be noted.
Street trees should be identified.
Shrub planting bands should be identified and explained.
Paving stone should be identified. Please bear in mind that non-standard pavement must be approved by DOT and the Art Commission. DOT's requirements will include a maintenance agreement. We have a basic agreement with DOT and the Art Commission about certain materials. Stone paving is not included in that agreement.
The standard Battery Park City tree pit has a minimum width of 5' and a depth of 5'. The maximum width of the tree pit on the drawings is 4'2-1/2" and is encroached upon by the bollard footings. The footings appear to have a 4' depth and are continuous. The depth of the tree pit appears to be only 3'.
The bollard spacing must meet minimum ADA requirements. Bollards should not be located within the handicapped ramps.
Will standard BPC b-poles be used for lighting? If not, what is proposed instead?
 
STEPHANIE GELB, AIA VICE PRESIDENT PLANNING AND DESIGN
We understand that the plaza between Sites 25 and 26 will be submitted at a later date. There needs to be a more convincing transition.
I hope that this is helpful to you. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

The parties hereto (other than Escrow Agent) agree that if Escrow Agent shall at any time exercise its right of set-off under Section 3.1(h) or otherwise, then the balance of the Escrow Fund after such set-off shall be re-allocated between the Ground Lease Payments Escrow and the Sales Tax Escrow based upon the relative percentages of the Escrow Amount representing the Ground Lease Payment Escrow and the Sales Tax Escrow immediately prior to such set-off. If it is determined that a party hereto is liable to any other party hereto for the amount so set-off by the Escrow Agent, then such amount shall be deposited by such party into the Escrow Fund with interest at the rate provided for in Section 1.3, and such amount and interest shall be allocated between the Ground Lease Payment Escrow and the Sales Tax Escrow based on the same percentages employed in the immediately preceding sentence (regardless whether such relative percentages may have subsequently changed).

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT
For accounts opened in the US:
          To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When an account is opened, we will ask for information that will allow us to identify relevant parties.
          Upon execution of this Agreement, the Tenant and Landlord shall provide the Escrow Agent with a fully executed W-8 or W-9 IRS form, which shall include the Tenant and Landlord's tax identification number. In addition, all interest or other income earned under the Escrow Agreement shall be allocated and/or paid pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof and reported by the recipient to the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. Notwithstanding such written directions, Escrow Agent shall report and, as required withhold any taxes as it determines may be required by any law or regulation in effect at the time of the distribution. In the absence of timely direction, all proceeds of the Escrow Amount shall be retained in the Escrow Fund and reinvested from time to time by the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 3. In the event that any earnings remain undistributed at the end of any calendar year, Escrow Agent shall report to the Internal Revenue Service or such other authority such earnings as it deems appropriate or as required by any applicable law or regulation or, to the extent consistent therewith, as directed in writing by the Landlord and Tenant. In addition, after consultation with the party on whose behalf taxes are to be withheld, Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it reasonably deems appropriate and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.
          Section 4.14    In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing at the time of execution of this Escrow Agreement, as indicated in Schedule 1 attached hereto), whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule 1 hereto ("Schedule 1"), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the authorized representatives identified in Schedule 1, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of your executive officers,

("Executive Officers"), as the Escrow Agent may select. Such "Executive Officer" shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed Incumbency Certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow Agent and the recipient's bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by the recipient to identify (i) the recipient, (ii) the recipient's bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a person other than the intended recipient being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the intended recipient s bank or an intermediary bank designated. The parties to this Escrow Agreement acknowledge that these security procedures are commercially reasonable. All person(s) designated to give funds transfer instructions to the Escrow Agent are indicated in Schedule 1 hereof. This schedule may be amended from time to time by written notice to the Escrow Agent from the applicable party.
