Including these non-cash expenses, net earnings were $2.48 billion and diluted earnings per common share were $5.08 for the first quarter.

Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.47 billion, 65% higher than the first quarter of 2005 and 55% higher than the fourth quarter of 2005. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $736 million, 78% higher than the first quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting strong growth in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $735 million, 53% higher than the first quarter of 2005, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in debt underwriting, primarily due to an increase in leveraged finance and investment-grade activity, and significantly higher net revenues in equity underwriting. The firm's investment banking backlog declined during the quarter.

Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $6.88 billion, 57% higher than the first quarter of 2005 and 68% higher than the fourth quarter of 2005.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $3.74 billion, 50% higher than the first quarter of 2005, as the business continued to operate in a favorable environment. Net revenues were significantly higher in credit products, commodities and currencies, as customer-driven activity was strong and market opportunities were favorable. In addition, net revenues in interest rate products were higher compared with a strong first quarter of 2005, while net revenues in mortgages were lower compared with the same prior year period.
Net revenues in Equities were $2.45 billion, 58% higher than the first quarter of 2005, as the business operated in a favorable environment, characterized by generally higher equity prices. Net revenues were significantly higher in the firm's customer franchise and principal strategies businesses. The increase in the firm's customer franchise businesses was primarily due to higher net revenues in derivatives and shares, reflecting strong customer-driven activity and favorable market opportunities. Net revenues in principal strategies reflected strong performance across all regions.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $695 million, reflecting a $405 million gain related to the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) and $290 million in gains and overrides from real estate and other corporate principal investments.
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.98 billion, 75% higher than the first quarter of 2005 and 60% higher than the fourth quarter of 2005.
Asset Management net revenues were $1.49 billion, 99% higher than the first quarter of 2005, reflecting significantly higher incentive fees and a 21% increase in management and other fees. Incentive fees were $739 million for the first quarter of 2006 compared with $131 million for the same prior year period. During the quarter, assets under management increased 7% to $571 billion, reflecting net asset inflows of $25 billion across all asset classes as well as market appreciation of $14 billion in equity, fixed income and alternative investment assets. The firm has numerous incentive fee arrangements, many of which have annual performance periods that end on December 31 and are not subject to adjustment thereafter. For that reason, incentive fees are seasonally weighted each year to the firm's first fiscal quarter.

st
Securities Services net revenues were $491 million, 29% higher than the first quarter of 2005, as the firm's prime brokerage business generated strong results, primarily reflecting significantly higher global customer balances in securities lending and margin lending.
Table of Contents
Operating expenses were $6.65 billion, 56% higher than the first quarter of 2005 and 75% higher than the fourth quarter of 2005.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses were $5.30 billion, 66% higher than the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to higher net revenues. Employment levels were essentially unchanged during the quarter.
Effective for the first quarter of 2006, the firm adopted SFAS No. 123-R, which requires that stock-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, including those subject to non-compete agreements, be expensed in the year of grant. In addition to expensing current year awards, prior year awards must continue to be amortized over the relevant service period. Therefore, although there is no incremental economic cost to the firm, the firm's compensation and benefits in 2006 will include both amortization of prior year awards as well as new awards granted to retirement-eligible employees for services rendered in 2006.
The majority of the expense related to the continued amortization of prior year awards will be recognized in 2006. The estimated annual expense for 2006 is approximately $650 million, of which $237 million was recognized in the first quarter of 2006. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues, excluding the non-cash expenses of $237 million for the continued amortization of prior year awards, was for the quarter compared with 50.0% for last year's first quarter. Including the non-cash expenses of $237 million, the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 51.3%.

Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $1.35 billion, 27% higher than the first quarter of 2005. Excluding non-compensation expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes , non-compensation expenses were 20% higher than the first quarter of 2005. Approximately one-half of this increase was attributable to higher brokerage, clearing and exchange fees in both Equities and FICC. Other expenses were higher primarily due to costs related to the firm's recently acquired insurance business and increased charitable contributions. Other expenses included net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $29 million for the first quarter of 2006 compared with $31 million for the same prior year period. Occupancy expenses increased primarily reflecting higher operating expenses and increased rent.
(4)
Provision For Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2006 was 32.8%, up from 32.0% for fiscal year 2005 and up from 29.5% for the first quarter of 2005, primarily due to a net benefit from various audit settlements recognized during the first quarter of 2005.

As of February 24, 2006, total capital was $143.57 billion, consisting of $28.92 billion in total shareholders' equity (common equity of $27.17 billion and preferred stock of $1.75 billion) and $114.65 billion in long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $60.42 based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 449.6 million at period end. Tangible book value per common share was $50.04.

The dividend will be paid on May 25, 2006 to common shareholders of record on April 25, 2006. The Board also declared dividends of $338.08, $387.50 and $338.08 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, respectively (represented by depositary shares, each representing a 1/1000th interest in a share of preferred stock), to be paid on May 10, 2006 to preferred shareholders of record on April 25, 2006.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 25, 2005.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that the firm expects to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 25, 2005.
