(f)           To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than sixteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158);
(g)           During the period beginning from the date hereof and continuing to and including the later of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for the Shares as notified to the Company by you and (ii) the last Time of Delivery for the Shares, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided hereunder, any securities of the Company that are substantially similar to the Shares, including but not limited to any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, Preferred Shares orShares or any such substantially similar securities (other than pursuant to employee stock option plans existing on, or upon the conversion of convertible or exchangeable securities outstanding as of, the date hereof) without your prior written consent;

(a)      To make no amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus during the Secondary Transactions Period that shall be disapproved by Goldman, Sachs & Co. promptly after reasonable notice thereof. The "Secondary Transactions Period" means the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing for as long as may be required under applicable law, in the reasonable judgment of Goldman, Sachs
 
& Co. after consultation with the Company, in order to offer and sell any such Shares in Secondary Market Transactions as contemplated by the Pricing Prospectus;
(b)      During the Secondary Transactions Period, to furnish to Goldman, Sachs & Co. copies of all reports or other communications (financial or other) furnished to stockholders generally, and to deliver to Goldman, Sachs & Co. (i) as soon as they are available, copies of any reports and financial statements furnished to or filed with the Commission or any national securities exchange on which the Shares or any class of securities of the Company is listed; and (ii) such additional information concerning the business and financial condition of the Company as Goldman, Sachs & Co. may from time to time reasonably request (such financial statements to be on a consolidated basis to the extent the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries are consolidated in reports furnished to its stockholders generally or to the Commission); and
(c)      Each time the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented during the Secondary Transactions Period, to furnish or cause to be furnished to Goldman, Sachs & Co., upon its request, written opinions of counsel for the Company, a letter from the independent accountants who have certified the financial statements included in the Registration Statement as then amended and certificates of officers of the Company, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Goldman, Sachs & Co., all to the effect specified in subsections (c), (d) and (j), respectively, of Section 8 hereof (as modified to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company may elect, upon notice to Goldman, Sachs & Co., not to comply with this Section 5A with respect to any Secondary Market Transaction, but only for a period or periods that the Company reasonably determines are necessary in order to avoid premature disclosure of material, non-public information, unless, notwithstanding such election, such disclosure would otherwise be required under this Agreement; and provided, further, that no such period or periods described in the preceding proviso shall exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any period of 12 consecutive calendar months. Upon receipt of any such notice, Goldman, Sachs & Co. shall cease using the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto in connection with Secondary Market Transactions until it receives notice from the Company that it may resume using such document (or such document as it may be amended or supplemented).
6.      (a)           (i)           The Company and each Underwriter agree that the Underwriters may prepare and use one or more preliminary or final term sheets relating to the Shares containing customary information;
 
(ii)           Each Underwriter represents that, other than as permitted under subparagraph (a)(i) above, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act without the prior consent of the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and that Schedule II(a) hereto is a complete list of any free writing prospectus for which the Underwriters have received such consent; and
(iii)           The Company represents and agrees that it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus without the prior consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and that Schedule II(a) hereto is a complete list of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses for which the Company has received such consent;
(b)      The Company has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; and
(c)      The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and, if requested by Goldman, Sachs & Co., will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter (or, in the case of any Secondary Market Transaction, to Goldman, Sachs & Co.) an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
7.      The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Shares under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the
 
Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Shares for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(d) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Shares; (v) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Shares; (vi) any fees and expenses in connection with the listing of the Shares; (vii) the cost of preparing the Shares; (vii) the costs and charges of any transfer agent or registrar or dividend distributing agent; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder and under any Additional Shares Option that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Shares by them, the cost of preparing and distributing any term sheet prepared by any Underwriter, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
8.      The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder, as to the Shares to be purchased at each Time of Delivery, shall be subject, in your discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of such Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
(a)      The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; any final term sheet contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof, and any other material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or threatened by the
 
Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to your reasonable satisfaction;
(b)      Counsel for the Underwriters shall have furnished to you such written opinion and letter, dated such Time of Delivery, to the effect set forth in Annex I hereto;

(d)      On the date hereof at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement and at such Time of Delivery, the independent accountants shall have furnished to you a letter, dated the date hereof, and a letter, dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex III hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as you may reasonably request, and in form and substance satisfactory to Goldman, Sachs & Co.;
(e)      (i)           Neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of Goldman, Sachs & Co. so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
(f)      On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock;
 
(g)      On or after the Applicable Time there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of Goldman, Sachs & Co. makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares being delivered at such Time of Delivery on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
(h)      The Depositary Shares comprising theShares being delivered at each Time of Delivery shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the NYSE, or application thereto for such listing shall have been made;
[
]
(i)      The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(e) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement; and
(j)      The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at such Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such time, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
9.      (a)           The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection
 
with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
(b)      Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from
 
the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)      If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose)
 
or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e)      The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10.      (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include
 
any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Shares.
(b)      If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares that remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Shares to be purchased at such Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at such Time of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c)      If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of all Shares to be purchased at such respective Time of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or, with respect to the Second Time of Delivery, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Shares) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11.      The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.
12.      Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the indemnity agreement of the Company in subsection (a) of Section 9 hereof, the representations and warranties in subsections (b) and (c) of Section 1 hereof and any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the Registration Statement or any Prospectus contained in any certificate furnished by the Company
 
pursuant to Section 8 hereof, insofar as they may constitute a basis for indemnification for liabilities (other than payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) arising under the Act, shall not extend to the extent of any interest therein of a controlling person or partner of an Underwriter who is a director or officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement or a controlling person of the Company when the Registration Statement has become effective, except in each case to the extent that an interest of such character shall have been determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction as not against public policy as expressed in the Act. Unless in the opinion of counsel for the Company the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, the Company will, if a claim for such indemnification is asserted, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such interest is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
13.      If this Agreement or the Additional Shares Options shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Firm Shares or Optional Shares with respect to which this Agreement or the Additional Shares Options, as the case may be, shall have been terminated, except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Shares except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
14.      In all dealings hereunder, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (and only Goldman, Sachs & Co.) shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters (including with respect to any determination as to whether any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters has been satisfied, any representation or agreement of the Company has been complied with or any such condition, representation or agreement may be waived), and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Goldman, Sachs & Co. as the representatives at One New York Plaza, 42 Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an
nd
 
Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
15.      This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
16.      Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
17.      The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
18.      This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
19.      
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
20.      The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial
 
by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
21.      This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
22.      Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us four counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.
Accepted as of the date hereof:
On behalf of each of the Underwriters

(3)      The issuance of the Shares in accordance with the Deposit Agreement and the sale of the Shares by the Company to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Shares, the Deposit Agreement, and the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, in each case with respect to the Shares, will not, (a) violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company, (b) result in a default under or breach of the agreements filed as exhibits nos.  -  through  - , inclusive, to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  - , 20.. and exhibits nos.  -  through  - , inclusive, to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended  - , 20..and exhibits nos.  -  to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed  - , 20..or (c) violate any Federal law of the United States or law of the State of New York applicable to the Company; , , that for the purposes of this paragraph (3), we express no opinion with respect to Federal or state securities laws, fraudulent transfer laws, other antifraud laws and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and related laws; and , , that insofar as the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Shares, the Deposit Agreementand the Underwriting Agreement is concerned, we express no opinion as to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each representing one of a share ofTitle of Preferred Shares(the "PreferredShares") of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the "Company"). The Depositary Shares are being issued pursuant a deposit agreement (the "Deposit Agreement"), dated as of , 20, between the Company and , as depositary. The Preferred Shares and the Depositary Shares representing the Preferred Shares, collectively, are herein called the "Shares".The Registration Statement relating to the Shares (File No. 333-) was filed on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution.

The Shares have been offered by the Prospectus dated , 20 (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated , 20 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Base Prospectus. The Base Prospectus, as so supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
                   
    
     
                    
     
     
In accordance with our understanding with you as to the scope of our services under the circumstances applicable to the offering of the Shares, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, as well as the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Base Prospectus, the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its counsel and its accountants and advised you as to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations
 
thereunder. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its counsel and its accountants concerning certain matters relating to the Company and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, an opinion of anAssociateGeneral Counsel of the Company and a letter from the Company's independent accountants delivered to you in connection with the offering of the Shares.
[
] [
]
On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of the prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we advised you and now confirm that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, and the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Shares, to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Shares,
(a)      any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
(b)      the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of : AP.M. on , 20 (which you have informed us is a time prior to the time of the first sale of the Shares by any Underwriter), when considered together with the statements made under the caption "Description of Title of Preferred Shares" [and "Description of the Depositary Shares"in, and the information in the tableon the front cover of, the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or

[

(c)      the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of the prior paragraph has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Shares, the Base
 
Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In addition, we do not know of any litigation or any governmental proceeding instituted or threatened against the Company that would be required to be disclosed in the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, and is not so disclosed. We call to your attention, however, the fact that the Company has an internal legal department and that, while we represent the Company on a regular basis, our engagement has been limited to specific matters as to which we were consulted by the Company and, accordingly, our knowledge with respect to litigation and governmental proceedings instituted or threatened against the Company is similarly limited. Also, insofar as the offering of the Shares is concerned, we do not know of any documents that, as of the date and time of delivery of this letter, are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement and are not so filed.
The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Preferred Stock We May Offer", "Description of Preferred Stock We May Offer  Fractional or Multiple Shares of Preferred Stock Issued as Depositary Shares","Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance" and "Plan of Distribution" in the Base Prospectus and "Description of Title of Preferred Shares", "Description of the Depositary Shares"and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions, therein described, of the Shares, the Deposit Agreementand the Underwriting Agreement relating to the Shares. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditor's attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package.
