Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.53 billion, 87% higher than the second quarter of 2005, reflecting growth across all regions, and 4% higher than the first quarter of 2006. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $608 million, 58% higher than the second quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting strong growth in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $918 million, 114% higher than the second quarter of 2005. Net revenues were significantly higher in equity underwriting, primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide equity and equity-related offerings, and in debt underwriting, primarily due to an increase in leveraged finance activity. The firm's investment banking backlog increased during the quarter.
Table of Contents
Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $6.96 billion, up from $2.81 billion in the second quarter of 2005 and essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2006.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $4.32 billion compared with $1.52 billion in the second quarter of 2005, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in commodities, credit products and interest rate products. The increase in commodities reflected a $700 million gain related to the sale of East Coast Power, L.L.C., one of the firm's power generation facilities, as well as strong results across the business. In addition, net revenues were higher in currencies and mortgages. During the quarter, FICC operated in a favorable environment generally characterized by strong customer-driven activity, favorable market opportunities, tight credit spreads and volatile markets.
Net revenues in Equities were $2.35 billion compared with $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2005, reflecting significantly higher net revenues across all regions in shares and derivatives. In addition, net revenues in the firm's principal strategies business improved compared with the second quarter of 2005. During the quarter, the business operated in an environment characterized by strong customer-driven activity and generally favorable market opportunities, although conditions became more challenging in May.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $293 million, reflecting $354 million in gains and overrides from corporate and real estate principal investments, partially offset by a $61 million loss related to the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG).
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.61 billion, 37% higher than the second quarter of 2005. Net revenues decreased 19% compared with the first quarter of 2006, reflecting lower incentive fees in Asset Management.
Asset Management net revenues were $954 million, 38% higher than the second quarter of 2005. The increase was driven by significantly higher management and other fees, primarily due to growth in assets under management, as well as higher incentive fees. During the quarter, assets under management increased 4% to $593 billion, reflecting net asset inflows of $15 billion, spread across all asset classes, as well as market appreciation of $7 billion, primarily in alternative investment and fixed income assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $656 million, 34% higher than the second quarter of 2005, as the firm's prime brokerage business continued to generate strong results, reflecting significantly higher global customer balances in securities lending and margin lending as well as higher seasonal activity levels in Europe.
Table of Contents
Operating expenses were $6.57 billion, 85% higher than the second quarter of 2005 and essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2006.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses were $5.09 billion compared with $2.40 billion in the second quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting higher net revenues. Employment levels increased 2% during the quarter.
In the first quarter of 2006, the firm adopted SFAS No. 123-R, which requires that share-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, including those subject to non-compete agreements, be expensed in the year of grant. In addition to expensing current year awards, prior year awards must continue to be amortized over the relevant service period. Therefore, although there is no incremental economic cost to the firm, compensation and benefits in 2006 will include both amortization of prior year awards as well as new awards granted to retirement-eligible employees for services rendered in 2006.
The majority of the expense related to the continued amortization of prior year awards will be recognized in 2006. The estimated annual expense for 2006 is approximately $650 million, of which $375 million was recognized in the first half of 2006. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues, excluding the non-cash expenses of $375 million, was 49.0% for the first half of 2006, compared with 50.0% for the first half of 2005. Including the non-cash expenses of $375 million, the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50.8% for the first half of 2006.

Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $1.49 billion, 28% higher than the second quarter of 2005. Excluding non-compensation expenses related to consolidated investment entities held for investment purposes , non-compensation expenses were 23% higher than the second quarter of 2005. One-half of this increase was attributable to higher brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, primarily in Equities. Other expenses were higher primarily due to costs related to the firm's insurance business, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2006, and net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $19 million.
(3)
Provision For Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2006 was 33.6%, up from 32.8% for the first quarter of 2006 and 32.0% for the fiscal year 2005. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first half of 2006 compared with the first quarter of 2006 was primarily due to the effect of lower estimated tax credits. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first half of 2006 compared with the fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the impact of audit settlements in 2005 and lower estimated tax credits in 2006.
Table of Contents
As of May 26, 2006, total capital was $157.39 billion, consisting of $31.80 billion in total shareholders' equity (common equity of $29.20 billion and preferred stock of $2.60 billion) and $125.59 billion in long-term borrowings.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 25, 2005.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that the firm expects to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 25, 2005.
