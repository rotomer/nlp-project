A copy of the Registrant's press release containing this information is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On September 12, 2006, the Registrant reported net revenues of $7.46 billion for its third quarter ended August 25, 2006. Net earnings for the quarter were $1.68 billion and diluted earnings per common share were $3.45 , in each case excluding incremental non-cash expenses of $133 million related to the accounting for certain share-based awards under SFAS No. 123-R . Including these non-cash expenses, net earnings were $1.59 billion and diluted earnings per common share were $3.26 for the third quarter of 2006. These results compare with $3.25 for the third quarter of 2005 and $4.97 , excluding incremental non-cash expenses of $138 million related to SFAS No. 123-R , for the second quarter of 2006.

Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.29 billion, 27% higher than the third quarter of 2005 and 16% lower than the second quarter of 2006. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $609 million, 9% higher than the third quarter of 2005, reflecting increased client activity. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $679 million, 49% higher than the third quarter of 2005. Net revenues were significantly higher in debt underwriting, primarily due to an increase in leveraged finance activity, and in equity underwriting. The firm's investment banking backlog was essentially unchanged during the quarter.

Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $4.72 billion, 7% lower than the third quarter of 2005 and 32% lower than a particularly strong second quarter of 2006.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $2.74 billion, 4% higher than a strong third quarter of 2005, reflecting higher net revenues in commodities and mortgages, partially offset by lower net revenues in currencies. In addition, net revenues in credit products were strong, but lower compared with the third quarter of 2005, while net revenues in interest rate products were essentially unchanged. Although FICC performed well, the business operated in a less favorable environment, as customer-driven activity declined from the first half of the year and volatility levels were generally low.
Net revenues in Equities were $1.55 billion, 3% lower than the third quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in principal strategies and, to a lesser extent, shares. These declines were partially offset by higher net revenues in derivatives and the contribution from the firm's insurance business, which was acquired in 2006. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment in which equity prices lacked direction and customer-driven activity declined from the first half of the year.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $430 million, reflecting a $261 million gain related to the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) and $169 million in gains and overrides from other principal investments.
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.46 billion, 20% higher than the third quarter of 2005 and 10% lower than the second quarter of 2006.
Asset Management net revenues were $918 million, 26% higher than the third quarter of 2005. The increase was primarily driven by significantly higher management and other fees, principally due to growth in assets under management. During the quarter, assets under management increased 6% to $629 billion, reflecting non-money market net asset inflows of $27 billion, principally in alternative investment and fixed income assets, money market net asset inflows of $3 billion and market appreciation of $6 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets.
 (3)
Securities Services net revenues were $537 million, 13% higher than the third quarter of 2005, as the firm's prime brokerage business continued to generate strong results, primarily reflecting significantly higher global customer balances in securities lending and margin lending.
Table of Contents
Operating expenses were $5.10 billion, 5% higher than the third quarter of 2005 and 22% lower than the second quarter of 2006.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses were $3.51 billion compared with $3.64 billion in the third quarter of 2005. Employment levels increased 7% during the quarter.
In the first quarter of 2006, the firm adopted SFAS No. 123-R, which requires that share-based awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, including those subject to non-compete agreements, be expensed in the year of grant. In addition to expensing current year awards, prior year awards must continue to be amortized over the relevant service period. Therefore, although there is no incremental economic cost to the firm, compensation and benefits in 2006 will include both amortization of prior year awards as well as new awards granted to retirement-eligible employees for services rendered in 2006.
The majority of the expense related to the continued amortization of prior year awards will be recognized in 2006. The estimated annual expense for 2006 is approximately $650 million, of which $508 million was recognized in the first nine months of 2006. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues, excluding the non-cash expenses of $508 million, was 48.0% for the first nine months of 2006, compared with 49.0% for the first six months of 2006 and 50.0% for the first nine months of 2005. Including the non-cash expenses of $508 million, the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 49.8% for the first nine months of 2006.

Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $1.59 billion, 29% higher than the third quarter of 2005. Excluding non-compensation expenses related to consolidated investment entities held for investment purposes , non-compensation expenses were 26% higher than the third quarter of 2005. More than one-half of this increase was attributable to higher brokerage, clearing and exchange fees, primarily in Equities. Other expenses were higher primarily due to costs related to the firm's insurance business, which was acquired in 2006.
(4)
Provision For Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 33.3% for the first nine months of 2006, down from 33.6% for the first six months of 2006 and up from 32.0% for fiscal year 2005. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2006 compared with fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the impact of audit settlements in 2005 and lower estimated tax credits in 2006.
Table of Contents
As of August 25, 2006, total capital was $162.82 billion, consisting of $33.49 billion in total shareholders' equity (common equity of $30.39 billion and preferred stock of $3.10 billion) and $129.33 billion in long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $67.87 based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 447.8 million at period end. Tangible book value per common share was $57.27.

On July 24, 2006, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. issued an additional $500 million of perpetual Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D (Series D Preferred Stock).
The firm repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $148.90 per share, for a total cost of $573 million during the quarter. On September 11, 2006, the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the Board) authorized the repurchase of an additional 60.0 million shares of common stock pursuant to the firm's existing share repurchase program. The remaining share authorization under the firm's existing common stock repurchase program, including the newly authorized amount, is 73.3 million shares.
The Board declared a dividend of $0.35 per common share to be paid on November 20, 2006 to common shareholders of record on October 23, 2006. The Board also declared dividends of $395.85, $387.50, $395.85 and $390.74 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, respectively (represented by depositary shares, each representing a 1/1000th interest in a share of preferred stock), to be paid on November 10, 2006 to preferred shareholders of record on October 26, 2006.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 25, 2005.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues that the firm expects to earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 25, 2005.
