Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
     This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the Registrant's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Registrant's control. It is possible that the Registrant's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the Registrant's future results, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 24, 2006 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 24, 2006.
     Statements about the Registrant's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the Registrant actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the Registrant's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 24, 2006.
