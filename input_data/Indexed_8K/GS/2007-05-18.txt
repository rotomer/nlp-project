On May 15, 2007, Goldman Sachs Capital II, a Delaware statutory trust ("GS Capital II") and a subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the "Registrant"), issued in a public offering 1,750,000 5.793% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital Securities, liquidation amount of $1,000 per security, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, to the extent described in the Registrant's prospectus supplement dated May 8, 2007, by the Registrant (the "Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal APEX"). We refer to this transaction as the "GS Capital II Transaction". Concurrently with the GS Capital II Transaction, Goldman Sachs Capital III, a Delaware statutory trust ("GS Capital III") and a subsidiary of the Registrant, issued in a public offering 500,000 Floating Rate Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital Securities, liquidation amount of $1,000 per security, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, to the extent described in the Registrant's prospectus supplement dated May 8, 2007, by the Registrant (the "Floating Rate Normal APEX" and together with the Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal APEX, the "Normal APEX"). We refer to this transaction as the "GS Capital III Transaction".
Under the terms of the Fixed to Floating Rate Normal APEX, the Registrant has agreed to sell to GS Capital II, and GS Capital II has agreed to purchase, 17,500.1 shares of the Registrant's perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (the "Series E Preferred Stock").

Upon the issuance of the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series F Preferred Stock, the ability of the Registrant to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of its common stock or preferred stock will be subject to certain restrictions. These restrictions are set forth in the Certificate of Designations to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Registrant, establishing the terms of the Series E Preferred Stock (the "Series E Certificate of Designations") and the Certificate of Designations to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Registrant, establishing the terms of the Series F Preferred Stock (the "Series F Certificate of Designations").

Under the RCCs, the Registrant covenanted in favor of certain of its debtholders, who are initially the holders of the Initial Covered Debt (as defined below), that it will not redeem or purchase (x) the Registrant's Remarketable 5.593% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2043 (the "Fixed Rate Notes") issued to GS Capital II, the Registrant's Remarketable Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes due 2043 issued to GS Capital III (the "Floating Rate Notes" and together with the Fixed Rate Notes, the "Notes") or Normal APEX prior to the Stock Purchase Date (as defined in each RCC) or (y) Normal APEX or shares of the Series E Preferred Stock or Series F Preferred Stock prior to the date that is ten years after the Stock Purchase Date, unless (i) the Registrant has obtained the prior approval of the SEC if such approval is then required under the SEC rules then applicable to consolidated supervised entities; and (ii) the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a maximum amount determined by reference to the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds the Registrant has received from the sale of common stock, rights to acquire common stock, mandatorily convertible preferred stock, qualifying preferred stock and certain qualifying capital securities since the date 180 days prior to delivery of notice of such redemption or the date of such purchase.

Guarantor's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or under their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Except as disclosed in the Pricing Prospectus, the Guarantor's internal control over financial reporting is effective and the Guarantor is not aware of any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting; and
(q) The Guarantor maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act; such disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to the Guarantor and its subsidiaries is made known to the Guarantor's principal executive officer and principal financial officer by others within those entities; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
2. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Guarantor and the Trust agree that the Trust issue and sell to each of the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Trust, at the purchase price set forth in Schedule III (a), the number of Normal APEX set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto.
As compensation to the Underwriters for their commitments hereunder, and in view of the fact that the proceeds from the sale of the Normal APEX will be used by the Trust to purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes, the Guarantor on the Closing Date will pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Goldman, Sachs & Co., for the accounts of the several Underwriters, the amount per Normal APEX set forth in Schedule III (a) in respect of the Normal APEX to be delivered by the Trust hereunder on the Closing Date.
3. Upon the authorization by you of the release of the Normal APEX, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Normal APEX for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus. Each Underwriter severally represents and agrees that it will not offer or sell the Normal APEX in the United States or to United States persons except if such offers or sales are made by or through NASD member broker-dealers registered with the Commission.
4. (a) The Normal APEX to be purchased by each Underwriter hereunder will be represented by one or more definitive global certificates representing the Normal APEX in book-entry form which will be deposited by or on behalf of the Company with The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its designated custodian. The Company will deliver the Normal APEX to Goldman, Sachs & Co., for the account of each Underwriter, against payment by or on behalf of such Underwriter of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the account specified by the Company to Goldman, Sachs & Co. at least forty-eight hours in advance, by causing DTC to credit the Normal APEX to the account of Goldman, Sachs & Co. at DTC. The Company will cause the certificates representing the Normal APEX to be made available to Goldman, Sachs & Co. for checking prior to the Time of Delivery (as defined below) at the office of DTC or its designated custodian (the "Designated Office"). The time and date of such delivery and payment shall be 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on May 15, 2007 or at such other place and time and date as Goldman, Sachs & Co. and the Company may agree upon in writing. Such time and date are herein called the "Time of Delivery".
 
(b) The documents to be delivered at the Time of Delivery by or on behalf of the parties hereto pursuant to Section 8 hereof, including the cross-receipt for the Normal APEX and any additional documents required by the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8(k) hereof, will be delivered at the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad St., New York, New York 10004 (the "Closing Location"), and the Normal APEX will be delivered at the Designated Office, all at the Time of Delivery. A meeting will be held at the Closing Location at 5:30 p.m., New York City time, on the New York Business Day next preceding the Time of Delivery, at which meeting the final drafts of the documents to be delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence will be available for review by the parties hereto. For the purposes of this Section 4, "New York Business Day" shall mean each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
5. The Trust and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree with each of the Underwriters (except that the agreements in paragraphs (f) and (i) of this Section 5 are made only by the Guarantor and not by the Trust):
(a) To prepare the Prospectus in a form approved by you and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the date of this Agreement; to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus prior to the Time of Delivery that shall be disapproved by you promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise you, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus has been filed and to furnish you with copies thereof; if requested by you prior to the Applicable Time, to prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Normal APEX and Related Securities, in the form set forth in Schedule III (b) hereto and to file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time required by such Rule; to file promptly all other material required to be filed by the Trust or the Guarantor with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Guarantor and (to the extent not exempt under Rule 12h-5 under the Exchange Act) the Trust with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and for so long as the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Normal APEX (including, in the case of Goldman, Sachs & Co., in any Secondary Market Transactions during the Secondary Transactions Period as defined in Section 5A hereof), and during such same period to advise you, promptly after either the Trust or the Guarantor receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or other prospectus in respect of the Normal APEX, of any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act, of the suspension of the qualification of the Normal APEX or any of the Related Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or other prospectus in respect of the Normal APEX or suspending any such qualification, to promptly use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order; and in
 
the event of any such issuance of a notice of objection, promptly to take such steps including, without limitation, amending the Registration Statement or filing a new registration statement, at the Guarantor's own expense, as may be necessary to permit offers and sales of the Normal APEX by the Underwriters (references herein to the Registration Statement shall include any such amendment or new registration statement);
(b) If required by Rule 430B(h) under the Act, to prepare a form of prospectus in a form approved by you and to file such form of prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than may be required by Rule 424(b) under the Act; and to make no further amendment or supplement to such form of prospectus which shall be disapproved by you promptly after reasonable notice thereof;
(c) If by the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Normal APEX remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Guarantor will file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Normal APEX and the Related Securities, in a form satisfactory to you. If at the Renewal Deadline the Guarantor is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Guarantor will, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Normal APEX and the Related Securities, in a form satisfactory to you and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Guarantor will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Normal APEX to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Normal APEX. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be;
(d) Promptly from time to time to take such action as you may reasonably request to qualify the Normal APEX and the Related Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as you may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Securities (including, in the case of Goldman, Sachs & Co., in any Secondary Market Transactions during the Secondary Transactions Period), provided that in connection therewith the Guarantor shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;
(e) Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement and from time to time, to furnish the Underwriters with written and electronic copies of the Prospectus in New York City in such quantities as you may reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required at any time prior to the expiration of nine months after the time of issue of the Prospectus in connection with the offering or sale of the Normal APEX or the Related Securities (or, in the case of Goldman, Sachs & Co., in connection with any Secondary Market Transactions during the Secondary Transactions Period, whether before or after such expiration) and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to
 
notify you and upon your request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as you may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and in case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) in connection with sales of any of the Normal APEX or the Related Securities at any time nine months or more after the time of issue of the Prospectus, upon your request but at the expense of such Underwriter, to prepare and deliver to such Underwriter as many written and electronic copies as you may request of an amended or supplemented Prospectus complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (it being understood, however, that the preceding clause, rather than this clause, shall apply with respect to Goldman, Sachs & Co. in connection with any Secondary Market Transactions during the Secondary Transactions Period); provided, however, that the Guarantor and Trust may elect, upon notice to Goldman, Sachs & Co., not to comply with this paragraph (e) with respect to any Secondary Market Transaction, but only for a period or periods that the Guarantor reasonably determines are necessary in order to avoid premature disclosure of material, non-public information, unless, notwithstanding such election, such disclosure would otherwise be required under this Agreement; and provided, further, that no such period or periods described in the preceding proviso shall exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any period of 12 consecutive calendar months. Upon receipt of any such notice, Goldman, Sachs & Co. shall cease using the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in connection with Secondary Market Transactions until it receives notice from the Guarantor that it may resume using such document (or such document as it may be amended or supplemented);
(f) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than sixteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Guarantor, Rule 158);
(g) To pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Act;
(h) To use their best efforts to list, subject to notice of issuance, the Normal APEX on the New York Stock Exchange;
(i) The Guarantor will issue the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Guarantee concurrently with the issue and sale of the Normal APEX as contemplated herein; and
(j) To use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the securities pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified in the Pricing Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds".
5A. The Trust and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree with Goldman, Sachs & Co., with respect to the issuance of the Normal APEX:
(a) To make no amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus during the Secondary Transactions Period which shall be disapproved by Goldman, Sachs & Co. promptly after reasonable notice thereof. The
 
"Secondary Transactions Period" means the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing for as long as may be required under applicable law, in the reasonable judgment of Goldman, Sachs & Co. after consultation with the Guarantor, in order to offer and sell any such Normal APEX in Secondary Market Transactions as contemplated by the Pricing Prospectus;
(b) During the Secondary Transactions Period, to furnish to Goldman, Sachs & Co. copies of all reports or other communications (financial or other) furnished to stockholders generally, and to deliver to Goldman, Sachs & Co. (i) as soon as they are available, copies of any reports and financial statements furnished to or filed with the Commission or any national securities exchange on which the Normal APEX or any class of securities of the Guarantor is listed; and (ii) such additional information concerning the business and financial condition of the Guarantor as Goldman, Sachs & Co. may from time to time reasonably request (such financial statements to be on a consolidated basis to the extent the accounts of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries are consolidated in reports furnished to its stockholders generally or to the Commission); and
(c) Each time the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented during the Secondary Transactions Period, to furnish or cause to be furnished to Goldman, Sachs & Co., upon its request, written opinions of counsel for the Guarantor, a letter from the independent accountants who have certified the financial statements included in the Registration Statement as then amended and certificates of officers of the Guarantor, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Goldman, Sachs & Co., all to the effect specified in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e) and (k), respectively, of Section 8 hereof (as modified to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Guarantor and the Trust may elect, upon notice to Goldman, Sachs & Co., not to comply with this Section 5A with respect to any Secondary Market Transaction, but only for a period or periods that the Guarantor reasonably determines are necessary in order to avoid premature disclosure of material, non-public information, unless, notwithstanding such election, such disclosure would otherwise be required under this Agreement; and provided, further, that no such period or periods described in the preceding proviso shall exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any period of 12 consecutive calendar months. Upon receipt of any such notice, Goldman, Sachs & Co. shall cease using the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in connection with Secondary Market Transactions until it receives notice from the Guarantor that it may resume using such document (or such document as it may be amended or supplemented).
6. (a) (i) The Guarantor, the Trust and each Underwriter agree that the Underwriters may prepare and use one or more preliminary or final term sheets relating to the Normal APEX and the Related Securities containing customary information;
(ii) Each Underwriter represents that, other than as permitted under subparagraph (a)(i) above, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Normal APEX and the Related Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act without the prior consent of the Guarantor and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and that Schedule II hereto is a complete list of any free writing prospectus for which the Underwriters have received such consent; and
(iii) Each of the Guarantor and the Trust represents and agrees that it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Normal APEX and the Related Securities that
 
would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus without the prior consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and that Schedule II hereto is a complete list of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses for which the Guarantor has received such consent;
(b) Each of the Guarantor and the Trust has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; and
(c) The Guarantor and the Trust agree that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Guarantor will give prompt notice thereof to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and, if requested by Goldman, Sachs & Co., will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter (or, in the case of any Secondary Market Transaction, to Goldman, Sachs & Co.) an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Guarantor by an Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
7. Each of the Guarantor and the Trust, jointly and severally, covenant and agree with the several Underwriters that it will pay all expenses incident to the performance of each of its and the Trust's obligations under this Agreement, and will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Guarantor's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Normal APEX and the Related Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Indenture, the Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Normal APEX and the Related Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Normal APEX and the Related Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(d) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Normal APEX; (v) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Normal APEX and the Related Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Normal APEX and the Related Securities; (vii) the costs and charges of any transfer agent or registrar or dividend distributing agent; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Normal APEX by them, the cost of preparing and distributing any term sheet prepared by any Underwriter, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
 
8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in your discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements on the part of each of the Guarantor and the Trust contained herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that each of the Guarantor and the Trust shall have performed all of its respective obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

(b) Counsel for the Underwriters shall have furnished to you such written opinion and letter, dated such Time of Delivery, to the effect set forth in Annex I hereto;
(c) A General Counsel or Associate General Counsel for the Guarantor shall have furnished to you his or her written opinion, dated such Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto;

(f) (i) Neither the Guarantor nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Guarantor or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Guarantor and its Significant Subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing
 
Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of Goldman, Sachs & Co. so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
(g) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Guarantor's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Guarantor's debt securities or preferred stock;

(i) The Guarantor shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(e) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement;

9. (a) The Guarantor and the Trust will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
 
therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Guarantor and the Trust against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Guarantor or the Trust may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, the Pricing Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Guarantor or the Trust for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Guarantor or the Trust, as appropriate, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim
 
and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Normal APEX. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Normal APEX underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Guarantor and the Trust under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the Guarantor and the Trust may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
 
conditions, to each officer and director of the Guarantor and the Trust and to each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Normal APEX that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Normal APEX on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Normal APEX, then the Guarantor shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Normal APEX on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Guarantor that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Normal APEX, or the Guarantor notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Normal APEX, you or the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Guarantor agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Normal APEX.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Normal APEX of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate liquidation amount of such Normal APEX that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate liquidation amount of all the Normal APEX, then the Guarantor shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Normal APEX that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Normal APEX that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Normal APEX of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Normal APEX of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate liquidation amount of Normal APEX that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate liquidation amount of all the Normal APEX, or if the Guarantor shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Normal APEX of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Trust, the Guarantor and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Guarantor, the Trust and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter,
 
or the Guarantor or the Trust, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Normal APEX.
12. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the indemnity agreement of the Guarantor and the Trust in subsection (a) of Section 9 hereof, the representations and warranties in subsections (b) and (c) of Section 1 hereof and any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the Registration Statement or any Prospectus contained in any certificate furnished by the Guarantor or the Trust pursuant to Section 8 hereof, insofar as they may constitute a basis for indemnification for liabilities (other than payment by the Guarantor and the Trust of expenses incurred or paid in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) arising under the Act, shall not extend to the extent of any interest therein of a controlling person or partner of an Underwriter who is a director or officer of the Guarantor or the Trust who signed the Registration Statement or a controlling person of the Guarantor or the Trust when the Registration Statement has become effective, except in each case to the extent that an interest of such character shall have been determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction as not against public policy as expressed in the Act. Unless in the opinion of counsel for the Guarantor and the Trust the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, the Guarantor and the Trust will, if a claim for such indemnification is asserted, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such interest is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
13. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Normal APEX are not delivered by or on behalf of the Trust as provided herein, the Guarantor and the Trust will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Normal APEX, but the Guarantor and the Trust shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
14. In all dealings hereunder, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (and only Goldman, Sachs & Co.) shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters (including with respect to any determination as to whether any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters has been satisfied, any representation or agreement of the Guarantor has been complied with or any such condition, representation or agreement may be waived), and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Goldman, Sachs & Co. as the representatives at One New York Plaza, 42nd Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Guarantor shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Guarantor set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Guarantor by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
15. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Guarantor, the Trust and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Guarantor and the Trust and each person who controls the Guarantor, the Trust or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Normal APEX from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
16. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
17. The Trust and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the Normal APEX pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Guarantor and the Trust, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Guarantor or the Trust, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Guarantor or the Trust with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Guarantor or the Trust on other matters) or any other obligation to the Guarantor or the Trust except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Guarantor and the Trust have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate. The Guarantor and the Trust agree that they will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Guarantor or the Trust, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
18. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters, or any of them, on the other, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
19. 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
20. The Guarantor, the Trust and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
21. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
22. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Guarantor and the Trust are authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Guarantor and the Trust relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us four counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Guarantor. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Guarantor for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We refer to the following transactions:
 
shares of the Company's perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E, liquidation preference $100,000 per share (the "Preferred Stock").
In connection with (i) the several purchases of the Capital Securities today from the Issuer by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 8, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Issuer, the Guarantor and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), (ii) the purchase of the Notes today from the Company by the Issuer and (iii) the execution and delivery by the Company and the Issuer of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, we, as counsel for the several Underwriters, have examined such corporate and trust records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, we advise you that, in our opinion:
(1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(2) All regulatory consents, authorizations, approvals and filings required to be obtained or made by the Company under the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes by the Company to the Issuer, the issuance, sale and delivery of the Capital Securities by the Issuer to the Underwriters and the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Guarantee Agreement and the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement have been obtained or made; , , that for the purposes of this paragraph (2) we express no opinion with respect to federal or state securities laws or to any regulatory consent, authorization, approval or filing required to be obtained or made by the Issuer.

(4) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939; the Notes have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered by the Company; and the Indenture and the Notes constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
(5) The Trust Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
(6) Each of the Guarantee Agreement and the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the Guarantee Agreement has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. For the purposes of this paragraph (6), however, we express no opinion with respect to any obligations that the Company, the Issuer and the Issuer Trustees may have with respect to the Capital Securities or the Trust Agreement or the effect that their performance of such obligations may have on the matters addressed in this paragraph (6).
(7) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.

Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent, Securities Intermediary and Securities Registrar, and the Trust, acting through the Property Trustee, has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
(9) The Preferred Stock has been duly authorizedand, when issued and paid for in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(11) Under the Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted and currently in effect in the State of New York (the "New York UCC"), the Collateral Agreement creates, as collateral security for the performance when due by the Trust of its obligations under the Stock Purchase Contracts, a valid security interest (as that term is defined in the New York UCC) in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company in the right, title and interest of the Trust in the securities and other assets and interests pledged to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Collateral Agreement (the "Pledged Securities") that constitute "securities" (as that term is defined in Section 8-102(a)(15) of the New York UCC); and in the case of such Pledged Securities that constitute
 
certificated "securities" (as defined in the New York UCC), such security interest shall be perfected upon delivery of such certificates (endorsed in blank) to the Collateral Agent in the State of New York and, assuming that neither the Collateral Agent nor the Company has notice of an adverse claim with respect to such Pledged Securities, the Collateral Agent will acquire a security interest in the Pledged Securities free of any adverse claim (as that term is defined in the New York UCC); in the case of Pledged Securities that are credited by a securities intermediary (as defined in the New York UCC) to a securities account (as defined in the New York UCC) in the name of the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall have a perfected security interest in all security entitlements (as defined in the New York UCC) relating to such Pledged Securities.
We express no opinion as to the perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection or priority of any security interest in (or other lien on) any portion of the Collateral (as defined in the Collateral Agreement) consisting of security entitlements in securities accounts, except to the extent that the securities intermediary's jurisdiction with respect thereto is the State of New York and that the New York UCC governs the establishment of such security interest.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. We have relied upon the opinion, dated the date hereof, of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A., delivered to you pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, with respect to the matters of Delaware law addressed therein, and as to such matters our opinion is subject to the same assumptions, limitations and qualifications as are contained in such opinion of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A.
 
We have also relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company, the Issuer Trustees and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Note Trustee, that the Trust Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Issuer under Delaware law and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the Issuer Trustees, that the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer, that the Guarantee Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantee Trustee, that the Notes conform to the specimen thereof examined by us, that the Note Trustee's certificate of authentication of the Notes has been manually signed by one of the Note Trustee's authorized officers, that the certificates for the Preferred Stock will conform to the specimen thereof examined by us and will be duly signed by the Company and duly countersigned and registered by a registrar and transfer agent of the Preferred Stock, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
Very truly yours,

Goldman, Sachs & Co.,      As Representatives of the      Several Underwriters,           85 Broad Street,                New York, New York 10004.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of 1,750,000 5.793% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital Securities, liquidation amount $1,000 per security (the "Securities"), of Goldman Sachs Capital II, a statutory trust created under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Trust"), and the related guarantee thereof by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), which is the sponsor of the Trust and the guarantor under the Guarantee Agreement referred to below.
The Registration Statement relating to the Securities and the related securities (including the Capital APEX, the Stripped APEX, the Notes, the Guarantee, the Contracts and the Preferred (each as defined in the Prospectus Supplement referred to below and, collectively, the "Related Securities")) (File Nos. 333-130074 and 333-130074-05) was filed on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus, dated December 5, 2006 (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated May 8, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Base Prospectus. The Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
In accordance with our understanding with you as to the scope of our services under the circumstances applicable to the offering of the Securities, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the documents listed in Schedule A (those listed documents, taken together with the Base Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and the Prospectus Supplement and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Guarantor, its counsel, special Delaware counsel to the Trust and the Guarantor's accountants and advised you as to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Guarantor, its counsel, special Delaware counsel to the Trust and the Guarantor's accountants concerning certain matters relating to the Guarantor and the Trust and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Guarantor and the administrative trustees of the Trust, opinions addressed to you from an Associate General Counsel of the Guarantor and special Delaware counsel to the Trust and a letter addressed to you from the Guarantor's accountants.
 
On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of the prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we advised you and now confirm that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, and the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
(a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 3:45 p.m. on May 8, 2007 (which you have informed us is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of the prior paragraph has caused us to believe that the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In addition, we do not know of any litigation or any governmental proceeding instituted or threatened against the Company that would be required to be disclosed in the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, and is not so disclosed. We call to your attention, however, the fact that the Company has an internal legal department and that, while we represent the Company on a regular basis, our engagement has been limited to specific matters as to which we were consulted by the Company and, accordingly, our knowledge with respect to litigation and governmental proceedings instituted or threatened against the Company is similarly limited. Also, insofar as the offering of the Securities is concerned, we do not know of any documents that, as of the time of delivery of this letter, are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement and are not so filed.
The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, any Post-Effective Amendment thereto, the Base
 
Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement except for those made under the captions "Description of Debt Securities We May Offer," "Description of Purchase Contracts We May Offer" and "Description of Preferred Stock We May Offer" in the Base Prospectus and under the captions "Description of the APEX," "Description of the Stock Purchase Contracts," "Certain Other Provisions of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and the Collateral Agreement," "Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes," "Description of the Guarantee", "Relationship among APEX, Junior Subordinated Notes, Series E Preferred Stock, Stock Purchase Contracts and Guarantee," "Description of the Series E Preferred Stock," "Replacement Capital Covenant" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement insofar as they relate to provisions of the Trust Agreement (as defined in the Prospectus Supplement), the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Collateral Agreement, the Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement, the Certificate of Designation to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Replacement Capital Covenant and the Underwriting Agreement therein described. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, any Post-Effective Amendment thereto, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement, as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, any Post-Effective amendment thereto, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the statements of the eligibility of the respective Trustees under the Trust Agreement, the Indenture and the Guarantee Agreement under which the Securities and certain of the Related Securities are being issued.
This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the several Underwriters, to you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the several Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities or the Related Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities or the Related Securities.
Very truly yours,
 
 
(1) The Guarantor has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware;
(2) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantor;
(3) The Junior Subordinated Notes have been duly authorized, executed, issued and delivered;
(4) Each of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture, the Guarantee, the Trust Agreement, the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and the Collateral Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; and
(5) The Preferred Stock has been duly authorized.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, such counsel has relied upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials and other sources believed by such counsel to be responsible; and that such counsel has assumed that each of the Indenture, the Guarantee, the Trust Agreement and the Collateral Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties (other than the Company), that the Junior Subordinated Notes and the certificate evidencing the Preferred Stock each conform to the forms thereof examined by such counsel (or members of the Company's legal department acting under such counsel's supervision), that the Indenture Trustee's certificate of authentication of the Junior Subordinated Notes has been manually signed by one of the Indenture Trustee's authorized signatories, and that the signatures on all documents examined by such counsel (or members of the Company's legal department acting under such counsel's supervision) are genuine, assumptions that such counsel has not independently verified. In addition, such counsel may state that such counsel has examined, or has caused members of the Company's legal department to examine, such corporate and partnership records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as such counsel has considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of such opinion.

As compensation to the Underwriters for their commitments hereunder, and in view of the fact that the proceeds from the sale of the Normal APEX will be used by the Trust to purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes, the Guarantor on the Closing Date will pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Goldman, Sachs & Co., for the accounts of the several Underwriters, the amount per Normal APEX set forth in Schedule III (a) in respect of the Normal APEX to be delivered by the Trust hereunder on the Closing Date.

Each Underwriter severally represents and agrees that it will not offer or sell the Normal APEX in the United States or to United States persons except if such offers or sales are made by or through NASD member broker-dealers registered with the Commission.

(a) The Normal APEX to be purchased by each Underwriter hereunder will be represented by one or more definitive global certificates representing the Normal APEX in book-entry form which will be deposited by or on behalf of the Company with The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its designated custodian.

The Company will cause the certificates representing the Normal APEX to be made available to Goldman, Sachs & Co. for checking prior to the Time of Delivery (as defined below) at the office of DTC or its designated custodian (the "Designated Office"). The time and date of such delivery and payment shall be 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on May 15, 2007 or at such other place and time and date as Goldman, Sachs & Co. and the Company may agree upon in writing. Such time and date are herein called the "Time of Delivery".

the event of any such issuance of a notice of objection, promptly to take such steps including, without limitation, amending the Registration Statement or filing a new registration statement, at the Guarantor's own expense, as may be necessary to permit offers and sales of the Normal APEX by the Underwriters (references herein to the Registration Statement shall include any such amendment or new registration statement);
(b) If required by Rule 430B(h) under the Act, to prepare a form of prospectus in a form approved by you and to file such form of prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than may be required by Rule 424(b) under the Act; and to make no further amendment or supplement to such form of prospectus which shall be disapproved by you promptly after reasonable notice thereof;
(c) If by the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Normal APEX remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Guarantor will file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Normal APEX and the Related Securities, in a form satisfactory to you. If at the Renewal Deadline the Guarantor is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Guarantor will, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Normal APEX and the Related Securities, in a form satisfactory to you and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Guarantor will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Normal APEX to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Normal APEX. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be;
(d) Promptly from time to time to take such action as you may reasonably request to qualify the Normal APEX and the Related Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as you may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Securities (including, in the case of Goldman, Sachs & Co., in any Secondary Market Transactions during the Secondary Transactions Period), provided that in connection therewith the Guarantor shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;
(e) Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement and from time to time, to furnish the Underwriters with written and electronic copies of the Prospectus in New York City in such quantities as you may reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required at any time prior to the expiration of nine months after the time of issue of the Prospectus in connection with the offering or sale of the Normal APEX or the Related Securities (or, in the case of Goldman, Sachs & Co., in connection with any Secondary Market Transactions during the Secondary Transactions Period, whether before or after such expiration) and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to
 
notify you and upon your request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as you may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and in case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) in connection with sales of any of the Normal APEX or the Related Securities at any time nine months or more after the time of issue of the Prospectus, upon your request but at the expense of such Underwriter, to prepare and deliver to such Underwriter as many written and electronic copies as you may request of an amended or supplemented Prospectus complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (it being understood, however, that the preceding clause, rather than this clause, shall apply with respect to Goldman, Sachs & Co. in connection with any Secondary Market Transactions during the Secondary Transactions Period); provided, however, that the Guarantor and Trust may elect, upon notice to Goldman, Sachs & Co., not to comply with this paragraph (e) with respect to any Secondary Market Transaction, but only for a period or periods that the Guarantor reasonably determines are necessary in order to avoid premature disclosure of material, non-public information, unless, notwithstanding such election, such disclosure would otherwise be required under this Agreement; and provided, further, that no such period or periods described in the preceding proviso shall exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any period of 12 consecutive calendar months. Upon receipt of any such notice, Goldman, Sachs & Co. shall cease using the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in connection with Secondary Market Transactions until it receives notice from the Guarantor that it may resume using such document (or such document as it may be amended or supplemented);
(f) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than sixteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Guarantor, Rule 158);

(a) To make no amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus during the Secondary Transactions Period which shall be disapproved by Goldman, Sachs & Co. promptly after reasonable notice thereof. The
 
"Secondary Transactions Period" means the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing for as long as may be required under applicable law, in the reasonable judgment of Goldman, Sachs & Co. after consultation with the Guarantor, in order to offer and sell any such Normal APEX in Secondary Market Transactions as contemplated by the Pricing Prospectus;
(b) During the Secondary Transactions Period, to furnish to Goldman, Sachs & Co. copies of all reports or other communications (financial or other) furnished to stockholders generally, and to deliver to Goldman, Sachs & Co. (i) as soon as they are available, copies of any reports and financial statements furnished to or filed with the Commission or any national securities exchange on which the Normal APEX or any class of securities of the Guarantor is listed; and (ii) such additional information concerning the business and financial condition of the Guarantor as Goldman, Sachs & Co. may from time to time reasonably request (such financial statements to be on a consolidated basis to the extent the accounts of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries are consolidated in reports furnished to its stockholders generally or to the Commission); and
(c) Each time the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented during the Secondary Transactions Period, to furnish or cause to be furnished to Goldman, Sachs & Co., upon its request, written opinions of counsel for the Guarantor, a letter from the independent accountants who have certified the financial statements included in the Registration Statement as then amended and certificates of officers of the Guarantor, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Goldman, Sachs & Co., all to the effect specified in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e) and (k), respectively, of Section 8 hereof (as modified to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Guarantor and the Trust may elect, upon notice to Goldman, Sachs & Co., not to comply with this Section 5A with respect to any Secondary Market Transaction, but only for a period or periods that the Guarantor reasonably determines are necessary in order to avoid premature disclosure of material, non-public information, unless, notwithstanding such election, such disclosure would otherwise be required under this Agreement; and provided, further, that no such period or periods described in the preceding proviso shall exceed 90 days in the aggregate during any period of 12 consecutive calendar months. Upon receipt of any such notice, Goldman, Sachs & Co. shall cease using the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in connection with Secondary Market Transactions until it receives notice from the Guarantor that it may resume using such document (or such document as it may be amended or supplemented).
6. (a) (i) The Guarantor, the Trust and each Underwriter agree that the Underwriters may prepare and use one or more preliminary or final term sheets relating to the Normal APEX and the Related Securities containing customary information;
(ii) Each Underwriter represents that, other than as permitted under subparagraph (a)(i) above, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Normal APEX and the Related Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act without the prior consent of the Guarantor and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and that Schedule II hereto is a complete list of any free writing prospectus for which the Underwriters have received such consent; and
(iii) Each of the Guarantor and the Trust represents and agrees that it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Normal APEX and the Related Securities that
 
would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus without the prior consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and that Schedule II hereto is a complete list of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses for which the Guarantor has received such consent;
(b) Each of the Guarantor and the Trust has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; and
(c) The Guarantor and the Trust agree that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Guarantor will give prompt notice thereof to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and, if requested by Goldman, Sachs & Co., will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter (or, in the case of any Secondary Market Transaction, to Goldman, Sachs & Co.) an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Guarantor by an Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
7. Each of the Guarantor and the Trust, jointly and severally, covenant and agree with the several Underwriters that it will pay all expenses incident to the performance of each of its and the Trust's obligations under this Agreement, and will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Guarantor's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Normal APEX and the Related Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Indenture, the Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Normal APEX and the Related Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Normal APEX and the Related Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(d) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Normal APEX; (v) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Normal APEX and the Related Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Normal APEX and the Related Securities; (vii) the costs and charges of any transfer agent or registrar or dividend distributing agent; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Normal APEX by them, the cost of preparing and distributing any term sheet prepared by any Underwriter, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.

(k) Each of the Guarantor and the Trust shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Guarantor and trustees of the Trust satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Trust herein at and as of such time, as to the performance by the Company and the Trust of all of their respective obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
9. (a) The Guarantor and the Trust will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
 
therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Guarantor and the Trust against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Guarantor or the Trust may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, the Pricing Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Guarantor or the Trust for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Guarantor or the Trust, as appropriate, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim
 
and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Normal APEX. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Normal APEX underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Guarantor and the Trust under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the Guarantor and the Trust may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
 
conditions, to each officer and director of the Guarantor and the Trust and to each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Normal APEX that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Normal APEX on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Normal APEX, then the Guarantor shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Normal APEX on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Guarantor that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Normal APEX, or the Guarantor notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Normal APEX, you or the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Guarantor agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Normal APEX.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Normal APEX of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate liquidation amount of such Normal APEX that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate liquidation amount of all the Normal APEX, then the Guarantor shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Normal APEX that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Normal APEX that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Normal APEX of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Normal APEX of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate liquidation amount of Normal APEX that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate liquidation amount of all the Normal APEX, or if the Guarantor shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Normal APEX of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Trust, the Guarantor and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Guarantor, the Trust and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter,
 
or the Guarantor or the Trust, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Normal APEX.
12. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the indemnity agreement of the Guarantor and the Trust in subsection (a) of Section 9 hereof, the representations and warranties in subsections (b) and (c) of Section 1 hereof and any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the Registration Statement or any Prospectus contained in any certificate furnished by the Guarantor or the Trust pursuant to Section 8 hereof, insofar as they may constitute a basis for indemnification for liabilities (other than payment by the Guarantor and the Trust of expenses incurred or paid in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) arising under the Act, shall not extend to the extent of any interest therein of a controlling person or partner of an Underwriter who is a director or officer of the Guarantor or the Trust who signed the Registration Statement or a controlling person of the Guarantor or the Trust when the Registration Statement has become effective, except in each case to the extent that an interest of such character shall have been determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction as not against public policy as expressed in the Act. Unless in the opinion of counsel for the Guarantor and the Trust the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, the Guarantor and the Trust will, if a claim for such indemnification is asserted, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such interest is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
13. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Normal APEX are not delivered by or on behalf of the Trust as provided herein, the Guarantor and the Trust will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Normal APEX, but the Guarantor and the Trust shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
14. In all dealings hereunder, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (and only Goldman, Sachs & Co.) shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters (including with respect to any determination as to whether any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters has been satisfied, any representation or agreement of the Guarantor has been complied with or any such condition, representation or agreement may be waived), and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Goldman, Sachs & Co. as the representatives at One New York Plaza, 42nd Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Guarantor shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Guarantor set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Guarantor by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
15. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Guarantor, the Trust and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Guarantor and the Trust and each person who controls the Guarantor, the Trust or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Normal APEX from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
16. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
17. The Trust and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the Normal APEX pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Guarantor and the Trust, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Guarantor or the Trust, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Guarantor or the Trust with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Guarantor or the Trust on other matters) or any other obligation to the Guarantor or the Trust except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Guarantor and the Trust have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate. The Guarantor and the Trust agree that they will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Guarantor or the Trust, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
18. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters, or any of them, on the other, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
19. 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
20. The Guarantor, the Trust and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
21. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
22. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Guarantor and the Trust are authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Guarantor and the Trust relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us four counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Guarantor. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Guarantor for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We refer to the following transactions:
 
shares of the Company's perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series F, liquidation preference $100,000 per share (the "Preferred Stock").
In connection with (i) the several purchases of the Capital Securities today from the Issuer by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 8, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Issuer, the Guarantor and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), (ii) the purchase of the Notes today from the Company by the Issuer and (iii) the execution and delivery by the Company and the Issuer of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, we, as counsel for the several Underwriters, have examined such corporate and trust records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, we advise you that, in our opinion:
(1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
(2) All regulatory consents, authorizations, approvals and filings required to be obtained or made by the Company under the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes by the Company to the Issuer, the issuance, sale and delivery of the Capital Securities by the Issuer to the Underwriters and the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Guarantee Agreement and the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement have been obtained or made; , , that for the purposes of this paragraph (2) we express no opinion with respect to federal or state securities laws or to any regulatory consent, authorization, approval or filing required to be obtained or made by the Issuer.

(4) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939; the Notes have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered by the Company; and the Indenture and the Notes constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
(5) The Trust Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
(6) Each of the Guarantee Agreement and the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the Guarantee Agreement has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. For the purposes of this paragraph (6), however, we express no opinion with respect to any obligations that the Company, the Issuer and the Issuer Trustees may have with respect to the Capital Securities or the Trust Agreement or the effect that their performance of such obligations may have on the matters addressed in this paragraph (6).

(11) Under the Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted and currently in effect in the State of New York (the "New York UCC"), the Collateral Agreement creates, as collateral security for the performance when due by the Trust of its obligations under the Stock Purchase Contracts, a valid security interest (as that term is defined in the New York UCC) in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company in the right, title and interest of the Trust in the securities and other assets and interests pledged to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Collateral Agreement (the "Pledged Securities") that constitute "securities" (as that term is defined in Section 8-102(a)(15) of the New York UCC); and in the case of such Pledged Securities that constitute
 
certificated "securities" (as defined in the New York UCC), such security interest shall be perfected upon delivery of such certificates (endorsed in blank) to the Collateral Agent in the State of New York and, assuming that neither the Collateral Agent nor the Company has notice of an adverse claim with respect to such Pledged Securities, the Collateral Agent will acquire a security interest in the Pledged Securities free of any adverse claim (as that term is defined in the New York UCC); in the case of Pledged Securities that are credited by a securities intermediary (as defined in the New York UCC) to a securities account (as defined in the New York UCC) in the name of the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall have a perfected security interest in all security entitlements (as defined in the New York UCC) relating to such Pledged Securities.
We express no opinion as to the perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection or priority of any security interest in (or other lien on) any portion of the Collateral (as defined in the Collateral Agreement) consisting of security entitlements in securities accounts, except to the extent that the securities intermediary's jurisdiction with respect thereto is the State of New York and that the New York UCC governs the establishment of such security interest.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. We have relied upon the opinion, dated the date hereof, of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A., delivered to you pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, with respect to the matters of Delaware law addressed therein, and as to such matters our opinion is subject to the same assumptions, limitations and qualifications as are contained in such opinion of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A.
 
We have also relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company, the Issuer Trustees and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Note Trustee, that the Trust Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Issuer under Delaware law and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each of the Issuer Trustees, that the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer, that the Guarantee Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantee Trustee, that the Notes conform to the specimen thereof examined by us, that the Note Trustee's certificate of authentication of the Notes has been manually signed by one of the Note Trustee's authorized officers, that the certificates for the Preferred Stock will conform to the specimen thereof examined by us and will be duly signed by the Company and duly countersigned and registered by a registrar and transfer agent of the Preferred Stock, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
Very truly yours,

Goldman, Sachs & Co.,      As Representatives of the      Several Underwriters,           85 Broad Street,                New York, New York 10004.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of 500,000 Floating Rate Normal Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital Securities, liquidation amount $1,000 per security (the "Securities"), of Goldman Sachs Capital III, a statutory trust created under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Trust"), and the related guarantee thereof by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), which is the sponsor of the Trust and the guarantor under the Guarantee Agreement referred to below.
The Registration Statement relating to the Securities and the related securities (including the Capital APEX, the Stripped APEX, the Notes, the Guarantee, the Contracts and the Preferred (each as defined in the Prospectus Supplement referred to below and, collectively, the "Related Securities")) (File Nos. 333-130074 and 333-130074-04) was filed on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus, dated December 5, 2006 (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated May 8, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Base Prospectus. The Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
In accordance with our understanding with you as to the scope of our services under the circumstances applicable to the offering of the Securities, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the documents listed in Schedule A (those listed documents, taken together with the Base Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and the Prospectus Supplement and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Guarantor, its counsel, special Delaware counsel to the Trust and the Guarantor's accountants and advised you as to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Guarantor, its counsel, special Delaware counsel to the Trust and the Guarantor's accountants concerning certain matters relating to the Guarantor and the Trust and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Guarantor and the administrative trustees of the Trust, opinions addressed to you from an Associate General Counsel of the Guarantor and special Delaware counsel to the Trust and a letter addressed to you from the Guarantor's accountants.
 
On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of the prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we advised you and now confirm that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, and the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
(a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 3:45 p.m. on May 8, 2007 (which you have informed us is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of the prior paragraph has caused us to believe that the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In addition, we do not know of any litigation or any governmental proceeding instituted or threatened against the Company that would be required to be disclosed in the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, and is not so disclosed. We call to your attention, however, the fact that the Company has an internal legal department and that, while we represent the Company on a regular basis, our engagement has been limited to specific matters as to which we were consulted by the Company and, accordingly, our knowledge with respect to litigation and governmental proceedings instituted or threatened against the Company is similarly limited. Also, insofar as the offering of the Securities is concerned, we do not know of any documents that, as of the time of delivery of this letter, are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement and are not so filed.
The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, any Post-Effective Amendment thereto, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement except for those
 
made under the captions "Description of Debt Securities We May Offer", "Description of Purchase Contracts We May Offer" and "Description of Preferred Stock We May Offer" in the Base Prospectus and under the captions "Description of the APEX", "Description of the Stock Purchase Contracts", "Certain Other Provisions of the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement and the Collateral Agreement", "Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes", "Description of the Guarantee", "Relationship among APEX, Junior Subordinated Notes, Series F Preferred Stock, Stock Purchase Contracts and Guarantee", "Description of the Series F Preferred Stock", "Replacement Capital Covenant" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement insofar as they relate to provisions of the Trust Agreement (as defined in the Prospectus Supplement), the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement, the Collateral Agreement, the Indenture, the Guarantee Agreement, the Certificate of Designation to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Replacement Capital Covenant and the Underwriting Agreement therein described. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, any Post-Effective Amendment thereto, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement, as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, any Post-Effective amendment thereto, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the statements of the eligibility of the respective Trustees under the Trust Agreement, the Indenture and the Guarantee Agreement under which the Securities and certain of the Related Securities are being issued.
This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the several Underwriters, to you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the several Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities or the Related Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities or the Related Securities.
Very truly yours,

In addition, such counsel may state that such counsel has examined, or has caused members of the Company's legal department to examine, such corporate and partnership records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as such counsel has considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of such opinion.
