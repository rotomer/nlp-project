A copy of the Registrant's press release containing this information is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On June 14, 2007, the Registrant reported net revenues of $10.18 billion and net earnings of $2.33 billion for its second quarter ended May 25, 2007. Diluted earnings per common share were $4.93 compared with $4.78 for the second quarter of 2006 and $6.67 for the first quarter of 2007. Annualized return on average tangible common shareholders' equity was 31.2% for the second quarter of 2007 and 37.8% for the first half of 2007. Annualized return on average common shareholders' equity was 26.7% for the second quarter of 2007 and 32.3% for the first half of 2007.
(1)
Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.72 billion, 13% higher than the second quarter of 2006 and slightly higher than the first quarter of 2007, as mergers and acquisitions and financing activity remained strong. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $709 million, 17% higher than the second quarter of 2006, reflecting increased client activity. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $1.01 billion, 10% higher than the second quarter of 2006, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in debt underwriting, primarily due to an increase in leveraged finance activity, partially offset by lower net revenues in equity underwriting. The firm's investment banking transaction backlog ended the quarter at a record level.
(2)
Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $6.65 billion, 6% lower than the second quarter of 2006 and 29% lower than the first quarter of 2007.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $3.37 billion, 24% lower than the second quarter of 2006, primarily reflecting lower net revenues in commodities and weak results in mortgages, principally attributable to continued weakness in the subprime

sector. The decrease in commodities was primarily attributable to a $700 million gain in the second quarter of 2006 related to the sale of East Coast Power, L.L.C. Net revenues in interest rate products were strong but lower compared with the same prior year period. Net revenues in credit products and currencies were also strong and were higher compared with the second quarter of 2006. During the quarter, FICC operated in an environment characterized by solid customer-driven activity, generally low volatility levels and strength in the broader credit markets.
Net revenues in Equities were $2.50 billion, 6% higher than the second quarter of 2006, due to higher net revenues in principal strategies as well as higher net revenues in the shares business, primarily in Europe. These increases were partially offset by strong but lower net revenues in derivatives compared with the second quarter of 2006. Following challenging market conditions early in the quarter, Equities operated in a favorable environment characterized by generally rising equity prices and strong customer-driven activity.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $784 million, primarily reflecting gains and overrides from corporate principal investments. These results included a $125 million loss related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and a $64 million loss related to the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG).
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.81 billion, 13% higher than both the second quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007.
Asset Management net revenues were $1.06 billion, 11% higher than the second quarter of 2006, reflecting a 22% increase in management and other fees, partially offset by lower incentive fees. During the quarter, assets under management increased $39 billion to $758 billion, reflecting non-money market net asset inflows of $14 billion in equity and fixed income assets, money market net asset inflows of $4 billionand market appreciation of $21 billion, primarily in equity assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $757 million, 15% higher than the second quarter of 2006, as the firm's prime brokerage business continued to generate strong results, reflecting significantly higher customer balances in securities lending and margin lending and higher seasonal activity levels in Europe.
Operating expenses were $6.75 billion, essentially unchanged from the second quarter of 2006 and 14% lower than the first quarter of 2007.
Table of Contents
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses were $4.89 billion, 4% lower than the second quarter of 2006, primarily reflecting the impact of a lower ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 48.0% for the first half of 2007 compared with 50.4% for the first half of 2006. Employment levels increased 4% during the quarter.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $1.86 billion, 16% higher than the second quarter of 2006 and 6% higher than the first quarter of 2007. The increase compared with the second quarter of 2006 was primarily attributable to the impact of higher levels of business activity and continued geographic expansion. The majority of this increase was in brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, which principally reflected higher transaction volumesin Equities.
Provision For Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2007 was 33.3%, down from 34.2% for the first quarter of 2007 and 34.5% for fiscal year 2006. The decreases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to changes in the geographic earnings mix and, to a lesser extent, an increase in tax credits.
As of May 25, 2007, total capital was $179.94 billion, consisting of $38.46 billion in total shareholders' equity (common shareholders' equity of $35.36 billion and preferred stock of $3.10 billion) and $141.48 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $81.30 and tangible book value per common share was $69.99, an increase of 5% and 6%, respectively, compared with the end of the first quarter of 2007. Book value and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 434.9 million at period end.
(1)
On May 15, 2007, two trusts created by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.) issued $2.25 billion of Automatic Preferred Enhanced Capital Securities (APEX). The assets held by the trusts in support of the APEX initially consist of remarketable junior subordinated notes and preferred stock purchase contracts issued by Group Inc. and will ultimately consist of $1.75 billion of perpetual Non-Cumulative Series E Preferred Stock and $500 million of perpetual Non-Cumulative Series F Preferred Stock, that Group Inc. will issue to the trusts no later than June 1, 2013 and September 1, 2013, respectively.
The firm repurchased 5.4 million shares of its common stock at an average cost per share of $208.41, for a total cost of $1.13 billion during the quarter. The remaining authorization under the firm's existing share repurchase program is 34.2 million shares.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements." These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the Registrant's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Registrant's control. It is possible that the Registrant's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the Registrant's future results, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 24, 2006 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 24, 2006.
Statements about the Registrant's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the Registrant actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the Registrant's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 24, 2006.
