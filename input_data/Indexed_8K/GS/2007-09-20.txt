Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $733 million, 8% higher than the third quarter of 2006, due to higher net revenues in equity underwriting, primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide equity and equity-related offeringspartially offset by lower net revenues in debt underwriting, as the financing environment became less favorable. The decrease in debt underwriting reflected lower net revenues in leveraged financeThe firm's investment banking transaction backlog decreased during the quarter, but was higher than at the end of 2006.

Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $8.23 billion, 70% higher than the third quarter of 2006 and 24% higher than the second quarter of 2007.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $4.89 billion, 71% higher than the third quarter of 2006, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in currencies and interest rate products. Net revenues in mortgages were also significantly higher, despite continued deterioration in the market environment. Significant losses on non-prime loans and securities were more than offset by gains on short mortgage positions. In addition, net revenues in both commodities and credit products were higher compared with the third quarter of 2006. Credit products included substantial gains from equity investments, including a gain of approximately $900 million related to the disposition of Horizon Wind Energy L.L.C. In addition, credit products included a loss of $1.71 billion ($1.48 billion, net of hedges) related to non-investment grade credit origination activities. Although the mortgage and corporate credit markets were characterized by significantly wider spreads and reduced levels of liquidity, FICC benefited from strong customer-driven activity and favorable market opportunities in certain businesses during the quarter.
Net revenues in Equities were $3.13 billion, more than double the amount of net revenues in the third quarter of 2006. Net revenues were significantly higher in derivatives, reflecting strength across all regions, as well as in shares due to higher commission volumes. In addition, net revenues in principal strategies increased compared with the third quarter of 2006. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by strong customer-driven activity and higher volatility.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $211 million, reflecting gains and overrides from real estate principal investments. Results in Principal Investments included a $230 million gain related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and a $261 million loss related to the firm's investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG).
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.96 billion, 35% higher than the third quarter of 2006 and 8% higher than the second quarter of 2007.
Asset Management net revenues were $1.20 billion, 31% higher than the third quarter of 2006, reflecting a 40% increase in management and other fees, partially offset by lower incentive fees. During the quarter, assets under management increased $38 billion to $796 billion, reflecting money market net inflows of $31 billion, non-money market net inflows of $19 billion spread across all asset classes, and net market depreciation of $12 billion, reflecting depreciation in equity and alternative investment assets, partially offset by appreciation in fixed income assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $762 million, 42% higher than the third quarter of 2006, as the firm's prime brokerage business continued to generate strong results, reflecting significantly higher customer balances in securities lending and margin lending.
Table of Contents
Operating expenses were $8.08 billion, 55% higher than the third quarter of 2006 and 20% higher than the second quarter of 2007.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses were $5.92 billion, 68% higher than the third quarter of 2006, primarily reflecting the impact of higher net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 48.0% for the first nine months of 2007 compared with 49.4% for the first nine months of 2006. Employment levels increased 7% during the quarter.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $2.16 billion, 27% higher than the third quarter of 2006 and 16% higher than the second quarter of 2007. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2006 was primarily attributable to continued geographic expansion and the impact of higher levels of business activity. The majority of this increase was in brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, which principally reflected higher transaction volumes in Equities. Other expenses also increased and included provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $35 million.
Provision For Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 33.2% for the first nine months of 2007, essentially unchanged from the first half of 2007 and down from 34.5% for fiscal year 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to changes in the geographic earnings mix and an increase in tax credits.
As of August 31, 2007, total capital was $190.19 billion, consisting of $39.12 billion in total shareholders' equity (common shareholders' equity of $36.02 billion and preferred stock of $3.10 billion) and $151.07 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $84.65 and tangible book value per common share was $73.10, each increasing 4% compared with the end of the second quarter of 2007. Book value and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 425.5 million at period end.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the Registrant's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Registrant's control. It is possible that the Registrant's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the Registrant's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 24, 2006 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 24, 2006.
Statements about the Registrant's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the Registrant actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the Registrant's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 24, 2006.
