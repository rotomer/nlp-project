Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.17 billion, 32% lower than the first quarter of 2007 and 41% lower than the fourth quarter of 2007.
Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $663 million, 23% lower than the first quarter of 2007, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $509 million, 40% lower than the first quarter of 2007, primarily due to significantly lower net revenues in debt underwriting. The decline in debt underwriting was primarily due to a decrease in leveraged finance and mortgage-related activity, reflecting difficult market conditions. Net revenues in equity underwriting were also lowerprincipally reflecting a decrease in industry-wide common stock offerings, partially offset by an increase in convertible offerings. The firm's investment banking transaction backlog decreased during the quarter.

Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $5.12 billion, 46% lower than the first quarter of 2007 and 26% lower than the fourth quarter of 2007.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $3.14 billion, 32% lower than a strong first quarter of 2007 as results were adversely affected by continued deterioration in the broader credit markets. Net losses on residential mortgage loans and securities were approximately $1 billion. In addition, credit products included a loss of approximately $1 billion ($1.4 billion before hedges) related to non-investment-grade credit origination activities, as well as lower results from investments compared with the first quarter of 2007. Across the broader franchise in FICC, activity levels were high and results were strong. Net revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities were significantly higher compared with the same prior year period.
Net revenues in Equities were $2.51 billion, 19% lower than a strong first quarter of 2007. This decline was principally due to significantly lower results in principal strategies. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by significantly lower equity prices. However, volatility levels continued to increase and customer activity levels were strong, which contributed to a significant increase in commissions compared with the same prior year period.
Principal Investments recorded a net loss of $532 million for the first quarter of 2008, reflecting a $135 million loss related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and losses from other corporate principal investments.
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $2.04 billion, 28% higher than the first quarter of 2007 and 11% higher than the fourth quarter of 2007.
Asset Management net revenues were $1.32 billion, 23% higher than the first quarter of 2007, reflecting higher management and other fees, and higher incentive fees. During the quarter, assets under management increased $5 billion to $873 billion, reflecting $29 billion of net inflows, partially offset by market depreciation of $24 billion. Net inflows primarily reflected inflows in money market assets, partially offset by outflows in equity assets, and market depreciation was in equity assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $722 million, 38% higher than the first quarter of 2007, reflecting significantly higher customer balances.
Table of Contents
Operating expenses were $6.19 billion, 21% lower than the first quarter of 2007 and 9% higher than the fourth quarter of 2007.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses were $4.00 billion, 35% lower than the first quarter of 2007, commensurate with lower net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 48.0% for the quarter, consistent with the first quarter of 2007. Employment levels increased 4% during the quarter, primarily due to the firm's acquisition of Litton Loan Servicing LP.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $2.19 billion, 24% higher than the first quarter of 2007. More than one-half of this increase was attributable to brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, principally reflecting higher transaction volumes in Equities. Growth in other non-compensation expenses generally reflected geographic expansion, growth in employment levels and higher levels of business activity.
Provision For Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2008 was 29.5%, down from 34.1% for fiscal year 2007 and 34.2% for the first quarter of 2007. The decreases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to changes in geographic earnings mix.
Table of Contents

These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the Registrant's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Registrant's control. It is possible that the Registrant's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the Registrant's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.
Table of Contents
Statements about the Registrant's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the Registrant actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the Registrant's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.
