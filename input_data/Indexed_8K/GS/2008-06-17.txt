Annualized return on average tangible common shareholders' equity was 23.5% for the second quarter of 2008 and 20.2% for the first half of 2008.

Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.69 billion, 2% lower than the second quarter of 2007 and 44% higher than the first quarter of 2008.
Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $800 million, 13% higher than the second quarter of 2007, reflecting strong client activity. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $885 million, 13% lower than the second quarter of 2007, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in debt underwriting, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in equity underwriting. The decline in debt underwriting was principally due to a decrease in leveraged finance activity, as market conditions remained challenging. The increase in equity underwriting reflected strong client activity. The firm's investment banking transaction backlog decreased during the quarter.

Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $5.59 billion, 16% lower than the second quarter of 2007 and 9% higher than the first quarter of 2008.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $2.38 billion, 29% lower than the second quarter of 2007, reflecting significantly lower results in credit products. Credit products included a loss of approximately $775 million (including a loss of approximately $500 million from hedges) related to non-investment-grade credit origination activities, and lower results from investments compared with the second quarter of 2007. The decrease in credit products was partially offset by higher net revenues in mortgages, which improved from a difficult second quarter of 2007, as well as higher net revenues in interest rate products, commodities and currencies. During the quarter, FICC operated in an environment characterized by solid client activity, generally tighter corporate credit spreads and volatile markets.
Net revenues in Equities were $2.49 billion, essentially unchanged from the second quarter of 2007, as significantly higher net revenues in the client franchise businesses were offset by significantly lower net revenues in principal strategies. Commission volumes were strong and were higher compared with the second quarter of 2007. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment generally characterized by strong client activity and higher equity prices, as well as continued high levels of volatility
.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $725 million for the second quarter of 2008. These results primarily reflected gains from corporate principal investments, as well as a $214 million gain related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC).
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $2.15 billion, 18% higher than the second quarter of 2007 and 5% higher than the first quarter of 2008.
Asset Management net revenues were $1.16 billion, 10% higher than the second quarter of 2007, reflecting higher management and other fees. During the quarter, assets under management increased $22 billion to $895 billion, due to $16 billion of market appreciation and $6 billion of net inflows. The increase in assets under management primarily reflected market appreciation in equity assets and net inflows in money market and fixed income assets, partially offset by net outflows in equity assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $985 million, 30% higher than the second quarter of 2007, as the firm's prime brokerage business continued to generate strong results, primarily reflecting significantly higher customer balances
.
Table of Contents
Operating expenses were $6.59 billion, 2% lower than the second quarter of 2007 and 6% higher than the first quarter of 2008.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses were $4.52 billion, 7% lower than the second quarter of 2007, commensurate with lower net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 48.0% for the first half of 2008, consistent with the first half of 2007. Employment levels decreased 1% during the quarter.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $2.07 billion, 11% higher than the second quarter of 2007 and 6% lower than the first quarter of 2008. Approximately one-half of the increase compared with the second quarter of 2007 was attributable to higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, which principally reflected higher activity levelsin Equities and FICC. The remainder of the increase compared with the second quarter of 2007 generally reflected the impact of geographic expansion and growth in employment levels.
Provision for Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2008 was 27.7%, down from 29.5% for the first quarter of 2008 and 34.1% for fiscal year 2007. The decreases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to changes in geographic earnings mix.
As of May 30, 2008, total capital was $226.87 billion, consisting of $44.82 billion in total shareholders' equity (common shareholders' equity of $41.72 billion and preferred stock of $3.10 billion) and $182.05 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $97.49 and tangible book value per common share was $85.16, an increase of 5% and 6%, respectively, during the quarter. Book value and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 427.9 million at period end.

The firm repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock at an average cost per share of $173.85, for a total cost of $203 million during the quarter. The remaining share authorization under the firm's existing share repurchase program is 62.4 million shares.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of its control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of Group Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of Group Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of Group Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of Group Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.
