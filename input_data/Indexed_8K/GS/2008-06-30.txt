Mittal has been elected a member of the Registrant's Board of Directors, effective as of June 28, 2008. Mr. Mittal also has been elected to the Board's Corporate Governance and Nominating, Compensation and Audit Committees. With the election of Mr. Mittal, the Registrant's Board consists of thirteen directors. A copy of a letter agreement between the Registrant and Mr. Mittal is being filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
     Mr. Mittal is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ArcelorMittal S.A.

Affiliates of the Registrant (referred to collectively as Goldman Sachs) provide ordinary course financial advisory, lending, investment banking and other financial services to ArcelorMittal and its affiliates, including the following:
     Goldman Sachs acted as a lead arranger in connection with an approximately 10.8 billion credit facility related to the acquisition of substantially all of the outstanding share capital of Arcelor S.A. by Mittal Steel Company N.V. in fiscal 2006 (the Merger). In fiscal 2007, Goldman Sachs did not make any loans under this facility, which was closed in December 2006.
     Since December 2006, Goldman Sachs has participated in an approximately 17 billion ArcelorMittal credit facility, agreeing to lend up to 500 million. During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 to date, the largest loan outstanding by Goldman Sachs was approximately 464 million, and ArcelorMittal paid interest to Goldman Sachs totaling approximately 15.3 million at an average rate of Euribor/Libor + 35.55 basis points. Goldman Sachs' current loan outstanding under the facility is approximately 247 million.
     In fiscal 2007, Goldman Sachs advised ArcelorMittal in connection with its approximately 4.025 billion mandatory tender offer for Arcelor Brasil S.A. and its approximately $3.4 billion acquisition of outstanding shares of Arcelor S.A. not previously acquired in the Merger.
     In May 2008, Goldman Sachs acted as a joint book-runner in connection with a $3 billion bond offering by ArcelorMittal. Since May 2008, Goldman Sachs has participated in an approximately $4 billion ArcelorMittal credit facility, agreeing to lend up to $166.75 million at an interest rate of Euribor/Libor + 57.5 basis points and up to $83.25 million at an interest rate of Euribor/Libor + 47.5 basis points. Goldman Sachs has not to date made a loan under this facility. In fiscal 2008, Goldman Sachs advised ArcelorMittal on its approximately $1.66 billion tender offer for the outstanding shares of ArcelorMittal Inox Brasil S.A.
