Item 8.01 Other Events.
On September 16, 2008, Group Inc. reported net revenues of $6.04 billion and net earnings of $845 million for its third quarter ended August 29, 2008. Diluted earnings per common share were $1.81 compared with $6.13 for the third quarter of 2007 and $4.58 for the second quarter of 2008. Annualized return on average tangible common shareholders' equity was 8.8% for the third quarter of 2008 and 16.3% for the first nine months of 2008. Annualized return on average common shareholders' equity was 7.7% for the third quarter of 2008 and 14.2% for the first nine months of 2008.
(1)
Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.29 billion, 40% lower than the third quarter of 2007 and 23% lower than the second quarter of 2008.
Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $619 million, 56% lower than a particularly strong third quarter of 2007, primarily reflecting a decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $675 million, 8% lower than the third quarter of 2007, due to lower net revenues in equity underwriting, primarily reflecting a decrease in industry-wide initial public offerings. Net revenues in debt underwriting were essentially unchanged from the third quarter of 2007. The firm's investment banking transaction backlog increased during the quarter.
(2)
Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $2.70 billion, 67% lower than the third quarter of 2007 and 52% lower than the second quarter of 2008.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $1.60 billion, 67% lower than a very strong third quarter of 2007, primarily reflecting particularly weak results in credit products and mortgages, which were adversely affected by broad-based declines in

asset values. Credit products included very weak results from investments and a loss of approximately $275 million (including hedges) related to non-investment-grade credit origination activities. Mortgages included net losses of approximately $500 million on residential mortgage loans and securities and approximately $325 million on commercial mortgage loans and securities. Commodities produced strong results, which were higher compared with the third quarter of 2007. Net revenues in currencies and interest rate products were also strong, although essentially unchanged from the third quarter of 2007. During the quarter, FICC operated in an environment generally characterized by wider mortgage and corporate credit spreads, volatile markets and lower levels of client activity.
Net revenues in Equities were $1.56 billion, 50% lower than a particularly strong third quarter of 2007. During the quarter, Equities operated in a challenging environment characterized by a significant decline in global equity prices, deleveraging by clients and generally lower client activity levels towards the end of the quarter. The decline in net revenues reflected very weak results in principal strategies. In addition, net revenues in derivatives were significantly lower than a particularly strong third quarter of 2007. Commissions were strong, but lower, compared with the third quarter of 2007.
Principal Investments recorded a net loss of $453 million for the third quarter of 2008. These results included losses from corporate and real estate principal investments, partially offset by a $106 million gain related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC).
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $2.05 billion, 4% higher than the third quarter of 2007 and 5% lower than the second quarter of 2008.
Asset Management net revenues were $1.13 billion, 6% lower than the third quarter of 2007, reflecting lower management and other fees, as well as lower incentive fees. The decrease in management and other fees primarily reflected the impact of one fewer week in the firm's fiscal third quarter of 2008 compared with the third quarter of 2007. During the quarter, assets under management decreased $32 billion to $863 billion, due to $25 billion of market depreciation, primarily in equity assets, and $7 billion of net outflows. Net outflows reflected outflows in equity and money market assets, partially offset by inflows in alternative investment and fixed income assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $916 million, 20% higher than the third quarter of 2007. The firm's prime brokerage business continued to generate strong results and customer balances were higher compared with the third quarter of 2007.
Table of Contents
Operating expenses were $5.08 billion, 37% lower than the third quarter of 2007 and 23% lower than the second quarter of 2008.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses were $2.90 billion, 51% lower than the third quarter of 2007, commensurate with lower net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 48.0% for the first nine months of 2008, consistent with the first nine months of 2007. Employment levels increased 3% during the quarter, primarily reflecting the seasonal timing of school hires.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $2.18 billion, 1% higher than the third quarter of 2007 and 6% higher than the second quarter of 2008. Excluding consolidated entities held for investment purposes , non-compensation expenses were 3% lower than the third quarter of 2007, primarily reflecting lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees.
(3)
Provision for Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2008 was 25.1%, down from 27.7% for the first half of 2008 and down from 34.1% for fiscal year 2007. The decreases in the effective income tax rate were primarily due to changes in geographic earnings mix and an increase in permanent benefits as a percentage of lower earnings.
As of August 29, 2008, total capital was $221.97 billion, consisting of $45.60 billion in total shareholders' equity (common shareholders' equity of $42.50 billion and preferred stock of $3.10 billion) and $176.37 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $99.30 and tangible book value per common share was $87.11, each increasing 2% during the quarter. Book value and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 428.0 million at period end.

The firm repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost per share of $180.07, for a total cost of $271 million during the quarter. The remaining share authorization under the firm's existing share repurchase program is 60.9 million shares.
The firm's Tier 1 Ratio was 11.6% as of August 29, 2008.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.
Certain of the information regarding the firm's capital ratio, total assets, level 3 assets and global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates; these estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its quarterly financial statements.
Table of Contents
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007.
