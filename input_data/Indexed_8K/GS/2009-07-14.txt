Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.44 billion, 15% lower than the second quarter of 2008 and 75% higher than the first quarter of 2009.
Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $368 million, 54% lower than the second quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $1.07 billion, 21% higher than the second quarter of 2008, due to significantly higher net revenues in equity underwriting, as well as higher net revenues in debt underwriting. The increase in equity underwriting reflected very strong client activity. The increase in debt underwriting primarily reflected higher net revenues from investment-grade and municipal activity. The firm's investment banking transaction backlog decreased during the quarter.

Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $10.78 billion, 93% higher than the second quarter of 2008 and 51% higher than the first quarter of 2009.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $6.80 billion, significantly higher than the second quarter of 2008. These results reflected particularly strong performances in credit products, interest rate products and currencies, reflecting strength in the client franchise. In addition, net revenues in both mortgages and commodities were higher compared with the second quarter of 2008. Results in mortgages included a loss of approximately $700 million on commercial mortgage loans. During the quarter, FICC operated in an environment characterized by strong client-driven activity, particularly in more liquid products, favorable market opportunities and tighter corporate credit spreads.
Net revenues in Equities were $3.18 billion, 28% higher than the second quarter of 2008, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in derivatives and, to a lesser extent, principal strategies. In addition, net revenues in shares were solid, but essentially unchanged compared with the second quarter of 2008. Commissions declined compared with the second quarter of 2008. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by solid client-driven activity, favorable market opportunities, a significant increase in global equity prices and a decline in volatility levels.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $811 million for the second quarter of 2009. These results included a gain of $948 million related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), a gain of $343 million from corporate principal investments and a loss of $499 million from real estate principal investments.
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.54 billion, 28% lower than the second quarter of 2008 and 6% higher than the first quarter of 2009.
Asset Management net revenues were $922 million, 21% lower than the second quarter of 2008, reflecting lower assets under management, principally due to market depreciation since the end of the second quarter of 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, assets under

management increased $48 billion to $819 billion , due to $42 billion of market appreciation, primarily in equity and fixed income assets, and $6 billion of net inflows.
(4)
Securities Services net revenues were $615 million, 38% lower than the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflected the impact of lower customer balances compared with the second quarter of 2008.
Operating expenses were $8.73 billion, 33% higher than the second quarter of 2008 and 28% higher than the first quarter of 2009.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes, severance costs and benefits) were $6.65 billion, which was higher than the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to higher net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 49.0% for the first half of 2009. Total staff decreased 1% during the quarter.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses, excluding consolidated entities held for investment purposes , were $1.80 billion, 8% lower than the second quarter of 2008 and 11% higher than the first quarter of 2009. The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2008 was attributable to lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, principally reflecting lower transaction volumes in Equities. In addition, non-compensation expenses during the second quarter of 2009 were generally lower than the second quarter of 2008 principally due to the impact of reduced staff levels and the effect of expense reduction initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of higher FDIC fees on bank deposits, including the impact of a special assessment of approximately $50 million, and net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $25 million. The increase in non-compensation expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes reflected real estate impairment charges of approximately $170 million during the second quarter of 2009. Including consolidated investment entities held for investment purposes, non-compensation expenses were $2.08 billion, essentially unchanged from the second quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.

Provision for Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2009 was 31.5%, up slightly from 31.0% for the first quarter of 2009.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.
Certain of the information regarding the firm's Tier 1 capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and average global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates; these estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its quarterly financial statements.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.
