Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $325 million, 47% lower than the third quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $574 million, 15% lower than the third quarter of 2008, due to significantly lower net revenues in debt underwriting, partially offset by higher net revenues in equity underwriting.

Table of Contents
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $5.99 billion, significantly higher than the third quarter of 2008.

Net revenues in interest rate products were also strong and significantly higher compared with the third quarter of 2008, while net revenues in commodities and currencies were lower compared with the same prior year period. During the quarter, FICC operated in an environment characterized by solid client activity levels, tighter credit spreads and a general improvement in asset values.
Net revenues in Equities were $2.78 billion, 78% higher than the third quarter of 2008. These results reflected strong net revenues in derivatives, which were significantly higher than the third quarter of 2008, as well as a solid performance in shares.

Asset Management net revenues were $974 million, 14% lower than the third quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in the composition of assets managed. During the third quarter of 2009, assets under management increased $29 billion to $848 billion, due to $39 billion of market appreciation, primarily in equity and fixed income assets, partially offset by $10 billion of net outflows. Net outflows primarily reflected outflows in money market assets, partially offset by inflows in fixed income assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $472 million, 48% lower than the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflected the impact of lower customer balances compared with the third quarter of 2008.
Table of Contents

The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 43.3% for the third quarter of 2009 (compared with 48.3% for the second quarter of 2009), resulting in a ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues of 47.0% for the first nine months of 2009.

Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $2.23 billion, 2% higher than the third quarter of 2008 and 7% higher than the second quarter of 2009. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2008 reflected the impact of a $200 million charitable contribution to The Goldman Sachs Foundation and $36 million of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings during the third quarter of 2009, partially offset by the impact of lower transaction volumes in Equities.
Provision for Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2009 was 32.2%, up slightly from 31.5% for the first half of 2009.
As of September 25, 2009, total capital was $255.07 billion, consisting of $65.35 billion in total shareholders' equity (common shareholders' equity of $58.40 billion and preferred stock of $6.96 billion) and $189.72 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.
Certain of the information regarding the firm's Tier 1 capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and average global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates; these estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its quarterly financial statements.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.
