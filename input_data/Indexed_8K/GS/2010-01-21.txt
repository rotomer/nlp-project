Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $34.37 billion for the year, significantly higher than 2008.
Full Year
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $23.32 billion for 2009 compared with $3.71 billion for 2008. During 2009, FICC operated in an environment characterized by strong client-driven activity, particularly in more liquid products. In addition, asset values generally improved and corporate credit spreads tightened significantly for most of the year. The increase in net revenues compared with 2008 reflected particularly strong performances in credit products, mortgages and interest rate products, which were each significantly higher than 2008. Net revenues in commodities were also particularly strong and were slightly higher than 2008, while net revenues in currencies were strong, but lower than a particularly strong 2008. During 2009, mortgages included a loss of approximately $1.5 billion on commercial mortgage loans. Results in 2008 were negatively impacted by asset writedowns across non-investment-grade credit origination activities, corporate debt, private and public equities, and residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities.
Net revenues in Equities were $9.89 billion for the year, 7% higher than 2008. Net revenues for 2009 reflected strong results in the client franchise businesses. However, these results were lower than a strong 2008 and included significantly lower commissions. Results in principal strategies were positive compared with losses in 2008. During 2009, Equities operated in an environment characterized by a significant increase in global equity prices, favorable market opportunities and a significant decline in volatility levels.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $1.17 billion for the year. These results included a gain of $1.58 billion related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), a gain of $1.31 billion from corporate principal investments and a loss of $1.76 billion from real estate principal investments.
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $6.41 billion, compared with negative net revenues of $4.36 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008 and net revenues of $10.03 billion for the third quarter of 2009.
Fourth Quarter
Table of Contents
Net revenues in FICC were $3.97 billion compared with negative net revenues of $3.40 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2009, FICC operated in an environment characterized by generally lower client activity levels than earlier in the year, continued tightening of corporate credit spreads and improving asset values. The increase in net revenues compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 reflected significantly improved results in credit products and mortgages compared with a very weak fourth quarter of 2008. Net revenues in interest rate products and currencies were significantly lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, while net revenues in commodities were essentially unchanged. Results during the fourth quarter of 2008 were negatively impacted by asset writedowns across credit origination activities, corporate debt, private and public equities, and commercial mortgage loans and securities, as well as by losses from trading in credit products.
non-investment-grade
Net revenues in Equities were $1.93 billion, 27% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. This decrease reflected lower net revenues, including significantly lower commissions, in the client franchise businesses compared with a particularly strong fourth quarter of 2008. Results in principal strategies were positive compared with losses in the fourth quarter of 2008. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by generally lower client activity levels than earlier in the year, an increase in global equity prices and a decline in volatility levels.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $507 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. These results included a gain of $441 million related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, a gain of $610 million from corporate principal investments and a loss of $559 million from real estate principal investments.
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $6.00 billion for the year, 25% lower than 2008.
Full Year
Asset Management net revenues were $3.97 billion, 13% lower than 2008, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in the composition of assets managed, principally due to market depreciation during the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as lower incentive fees. During the year ended December 31, 2009, assets under management increased $73 billion to $871 billion, due to $76 billion of market appreciation, primarily in fixed income and equity assets, partially offset by $3 billion of net outflows. Outflows in money market assets were offset by inflows in fixed income assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $2.03 billion, 41% lower than 2008. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflected the impact of lower customer balances, reflecting lower hedge fund industry assets and reduced leverage.
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.57 billion, 10% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008 and 8% higher than the third quarter of 2009.
Fourth Quarter
Table of Contents
Asset Management net revenues were $1.13 billion, 19% higher than the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting higher incentive fees, as well as higher management and other fees. During the quarter, assets under management increased $23 billion to $871 billion, due to $12 billion of net inflows, primarily reflecting inflows in fixed income assets, partially offset by outflows in money market assets, and $11 billion of market appreciation across all asset classes.
Securities Services net revenues were $443 million, 45% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflected the impact of changes in the composition of securities lending customer balances, as well as lower total customer balances. The decline in total customer balances reflected lower hedge fund industry assets and reduced leverage.
Operating expenses were $25.34 billion for the year, 27% higher than 2008.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes, severance costs and benefits) were $16.19 billion for the year and were 35.8% of net revenues. This ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was down from 48.0% (excluding severance costs of approximately $275 million in the fourth quarter of 2008) for 2008 and represented the firm's lowest annual ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues. In the fourth quarter, compensation was reduced by $500 million to fund a charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives, which is reflected in the negative compensation and benefits expenses of $519 million for the quarter.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $9.15 billion for the year, 2% higher than 2008. The increase compared with 2008 reflected the impact of charitable contributions of approximately $850 million (included in other expenses) during 2009, primarily including $310 million to The Goldman Sachs Foundation and $500 million to Goldman Sachs Gives. Compensation was reduced to fund the charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. The focus for this $500 million contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives is on those areas that have proven to be fundamental to creating jobs and economic growth, building and stabilizing communities, honoring service and veterans and increasing educational opportunities. The firm will ask its participating managing directors to make recommendations regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution. Depreciation and amortization expenses also increased compared with 2008 and included real estate impairment charges of approximately $600 million related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes during 2009. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, principally reflecting lower transaction volumes in Equities, and the impact of reduced staff levels and expense reduction initiatives during 2009.

In addition, other expenses included $30 million of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings during the fourth quarter of 2009. These increases were partially offset by lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, primarily reflecting lower transaction volumes in Equities, lower depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily due to decreased real estate impairment charges related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the impact of reduced staff levels and expense reduction initiatives.

"Throughout the year, particularly during the most difficult conditions, Goldman Sachs was an active adviser, market maker and asset manager for our clients," said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong client franchise across global capital markets, along with the commitment and dedication of our people drove our strong performance. That performance, as well as recognition of the broader environment, resulted in our lowest ever compensation to net revenues ratio. Despite significant economic headwinds, we are seeing signs of growth and remain focused on supporting that growth by helping companies raise capital and manage their risks, by providing liquidity to markets and by investing for our clients."

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.
Forward-looking
Certain of the information regarding the firm's capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and average global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates; these estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008.
