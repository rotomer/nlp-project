(Group Inc. and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the firm) reported its earnings for its first quarter ended A copy of Group Inc.'s press release containing this information is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
March 31, 2010.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Group Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
On April 20, 2010, Group Inc. reported net revenues of $12.78 billion and net earnings of $3.46 billion for its first quarter ended Diluted earnings per common share were $5.59 compared with $3.39 for the first quarter of 2009 and $8.20 for the fourth quarter of 2009. Annualized return on average common shareholders' equity (ROE) was 20.1% for the first quarter of 2010.
March 31, 2010.
(1)
Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.18 billion, 44% higher than the first quarter of 2009 and 28% lower than the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $464 million, 12% lower than the first quarter of 2009, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $720 million, more than double the amount in the first quarter of 2009. Net revenues in equity underwriting were significantly higher, primarily reflecting a significant increase in industry-wide equity and equity-related offerings compared with a difficult first quarter of 2009. Net revenues in debt underwriting were also significantly higher, primarily reflecting an increase in leveraged finance activity. The firm's investment banking transaction backlog was essentially unchanged compared with the end of 2009.
(2)
Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $10.25 billion, 43% higher than the first quarter of 2009 and 60% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $7.39 billion, 13% higher than the first quarter of 2009, reflecting strength in the client franchise. These results reflected strong performances in credit products, mortgages and currencies, which

were each significantly higher compared with the first quarter of 2009. Net revenues in interest rate products and commodities were also strong, although each was significantly lower compared with particularly strong results in the first quarter of 2009. During the first quarter of 2009, credit products included losses from corporate debt and private equity investments, and mortgages included a loss of approximately $800 million (excluding hedges) on commercial mortgage loans and securities. During the first quarter of 2010, FICC operated in an environment characterized by strong client-driven activity, increased volumes across several businesses, tighter bid-offer spreads and a decline in volatility levels.
Net revenues in Equities were $2.35 billion, 18% higher than the first quarter of 2009. These results reflected strong net revenues in derivatives, which were significantly higher than the first quarter of 2009. In addition, results in principal strategies were positive compared with losses in the first quarter of 2009. Commissions were lower compared with the first quarter of 2009, reflecting generally lower market volumes. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment largely characterized by an increase in global equity prices and a decline in volatility levels.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $510 million for the first quarter of 2010. These results included a net gain of $760 million from corporate principal investments, partially offset by a loss of $222 million related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and a net loss of $34 million from real estate principal investments.
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.34 billion, 8% lower than the first quarter of 2009 and 14% lower than the fourth quarter of 2009.
Asset Management net revenues were $946 million, essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2009. During the first quarter of 2010, assets under management decreased $31 billion to $840 billion, due to $39 billion of net outflows, primarily reflecting outflows in money market assets, consistent with industry trends, partially offset by inflows in fixed income assets, and $8 billion of market appreciation, primarily in equity assets.
Securities Services net revenues were $395 million, 21% lower than the first quarter of 2009. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflected tighter securities lending spreads, principally due to the impact of changes in the composition of securities lending customer balances, partially offset by the impact of higher average customer balances.
Table of Contents
Operating expenses were $7.62 billion, 12% higher than the first quarter of 2009.
Compensation and Benefits
The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes, benefits and severance costs) was $5.49 billion for the first quarter of 2010. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 43.0% for the first quarter of 2010, down from 50.0% for the first quarter of 2009.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $2.12 billion, 2% higher than the first quarter of 2009 and 23% lower than the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase compared with the first quarter of 2009 primarily reflected higher levels of business activity, as well as the impact of charitable contributions of $40 million and net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $21 million during the first quarter of 2010. These increases were partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization expenses, due to the impact of significantly higher real estate impairment charges in the first quarter of 2009 related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes.
Provision for Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 33.0%, up slightly from 32.5% for fiscal year 2009.
As of March 31, 2010, total capital was $253.35 billion, consisting of $72.94 billion in total shareholders' equity (common shareholders' equity of $65.99 billion and preferred stock of $6.96 billion) and $180.41 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $122.52 and tangible book value per common share was $111.41, an increase of 4% and 3%, respectively, during the quarter. Book value and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 538.6 million at period end.
(3)
In keeping with the firm's long-standing policy of repurchasing shares to offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee share-based compensation, the firm repurchased 13.2 million shares of its common stock at an average cost per share of $172.15, for a total cost of $2.27 billion. Including the effect of these share repurchases, common shareholders' equity increased $2.23 billion during the quarter.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
Table of Contents
Certain of the information regarding the firm's capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and average global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates; these estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
