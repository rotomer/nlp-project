The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Group Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.

Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.12 billion, 24% higher than the third quarter of 2009 and 22% higher than the second quarter of 2010.
Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $496 million, 53% higher than a difficult third quarter of 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in client activity. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $623 million, 9% higher than the third quarter of 2009, due to significantly higher net revenues in debt underwriting, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in equity underwriting. The increase in debt underwriting primarily reflected a significant increase in leveraged finance activity. The decline in equity underwriting primarily reflected lower levels of activity. The firm's investment banking transaction backlog was essentially unchanged compared with the end of the second quarter of 2010.

Trading and Principal Investments
Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $6.38 billion, 36% lower than the third quarter of 2009 and 3% lower than the second quarter of 2010.
Table of Contents
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were $3.77 billion, 37% lower than a strong third quarter of 2009, reflecting a challenging environment during the quarter, as activity levels were significantly lower compared with the third quarter of 2009. The decrease in net revenues compared with the third quarter of 2009 reflected lower results in each of FICC's major businesses, including significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products and credit products.
Net revenues in Equities were $1.86 billion, 33% lower than a strong third quarter of 2009. This decrease primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in the client franchise businesses, principally due to lower activity levels compared with the third quarter of 2009. The environment during the quarter was also characterized by an increase in global equity prices and lower volatility levels.
Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $754 million for the third quarter of 2010. These results primarily reflected a net gain of $635 million from corporate principal investments and overrides of $132 million.
Asset Management and Securities Services
Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.40 billion, 3% lower than the third quarter of 2009 and 2% higher than the second quarter of 2010.
Net revenues in Asset Management were $1.02 billion, 5% higher than the third quarter of 2009, reflecting higher management and other fees and higher incentive fees. During the third quarter of 2010, assets under management increased $21 billion to $823 billion, due to $34 billion of net market appreciation, primarily in equity and fixed income assets, partially offset by $13 billion of net outflows, primarily in equity and money market assets.
Net revenues in Securities Services were $383 million, 19% lower than the third quarter of 2009. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflected tighter securities lending spreads, principally due to the impact of changes in the composition of customer balances, partially offset by the impact of higher average customer balances.
Table of Contents
Operating expenses were $6.09 billion, 20% lower than the third quarter of 2009 and 18% lower than the second quarter of 2010.
Compensation and Benefits
The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses was $3.83 billion for the third quarter of 2010. The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses was $13.12 billion for the first nine months of 2010, a 21% decline compared with $16.71 billion for the first nine months of 2009. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for the first nine months of 2010 was 43.0% (which excludes the impact of the $600 million U.K. bank payroll tax in the second quarter of 2010), down from 47.0% for the first nine months of 2009.
(5)
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $2.26 billion, 2% higher than the third quarter of 2009. During the third quarter of 2010, other expenses included $27 million of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings.
Provision for Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2010, excluding the impact of the $600 million U.K. bank payroll tax and the $550 million SEC settlement in the second quarter of 2010, substantially all of which is non-deductible, was 32.7% , essentially unchanged from 32.8% for the first half of 2010 and 32.5% for fiscal year 2009. Including the impact of these amounts, the effective income tax rate was 36.6% for the first nine months of 2010.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
Certain of the information regarding the firm's current and projected capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates and projections. These estimates and projections are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
