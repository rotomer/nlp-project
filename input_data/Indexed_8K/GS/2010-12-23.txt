Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 17, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the firm) adopted The Goldman Sachs Long-Term Performance Incentive Plan (the Plan), pursuant to which performance-based awards may be granted from time to time to key employees of the firm as determined by the Compensation Committee, which will administer the Plan. The Plan supplements our existing compensation programs and is an additional component that the Compensation Committee may use in its discretion. Consistent with the firm's Compensation Principles and existing compensation programs, it is intended that any awards granted under the Plan will be designed to align compensation with long-term performance in a manner that does not encourage imprudent risk-taking. The firm's Chief Risk Officer was involved in the design of the Plan, and it is expected that he will review key terms of any awards under the Plan. The Plan is intended to assist in assuring that the firm's incentive compensation structure is balanced and consistent with the safety and soundness of the firm.
The Plan permits the Compensation Committee to take into account a wide range of factors in granting awards. Awards may, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, consist of cash awards, equity-based awards and/or other securities of Group Inc. or other property. All equity-based awards that require shareholder approval under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange will be granted under, and must be consistent with and subject to all of the terms and conditions of, The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan, which has been approved by Group Inc.'s shareholders.
The amounts payable under an award in equity, cash or other property may vary based on, or be conditioned all or in part on, the satisfaction over a performance period of one or more performance measures, on an annual and/or cumulative basis, relating to firm or other performance, including, but not limited to, return on equity, return on common equity, total shareholder return, market price of Group Inc. common stock or the market price, face amount or discounted value of other debt or equity securities, book value per share, earnings per share, net income, pre-tax operating income, net revenues or pre-tax earnings. Awards may include provisions that permit the firm to recapture or cancel all or a portion of the awards in circumstances determined by the Compensation Committee and specified in the award agreement, such as where the employee engaged in conduct constituting "Cause" (which includes, among other things, any conduct detrimental to the firm) or where the employee engaged in materially improper risk analysis or failed sufficiently to raise concerns about risks. The Compensation Committee also may determine to restrict transfer of Group Inc. common stock or other securities received under the awards.
Attached as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K are copies of the Plan, a form of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, a form of Performance-Based Option Award Agreement and a form of Performance-Based Cash Compensation Award Agreement. The foregoing summary of certain provisions of the Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.

          (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, with respect to any Award granted to a U.S. taxpayer that is "nonqualified deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A: (i) references to termination of the Participant's employment will mean the Participant's "separation from service" with the Firm (as such term is defined and used in Section 409A); (ii) if a Participant is deemed to be a "specified employee" (as determined by GS Inc. in accordance with Section 409A and Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(2)) as of the Participant's "separation from service", any payments (whether in cash, shares of GS Inc. common stock or other securities of GS Inc. or other property) to be made with respect to the Award upon the Participant's "separation from service" will be accumulated and paid (without interest) on the earlier of (x) first business day of the seventh month following the Participant's "separation from
 
service" and (y) the date of the Participant's death; (iii) if the Award includes a "series of installment payments" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), the Participant's right to the series of installment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments and not as a right to a single payment; and (iv) to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, any other securities, other Awards or other property that GS Inc. may deliver in lieu of shares of GS Inc. common stock or other securities of GS Inc. in respect of an Award shall not have the effect of deferring delivery or payment, U.S. income inclusion, or a substantial risk of forfeiture beyond the date on which such delivery, payment or inclusion would occur or such risk of forfeiture would lapse, with respect to the shares of GS Inc. common stock or other securities of GS Inc. that would otherwise have been deliverable (unless the Committee elects a later date for this purpose in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A).

GS Inc. will notify you,
Performance Goals

Exercisability of Performance Options
     (a) . Only Performance Options that are Outstanding and Vested can be exercised. Outstanding Vested Performance Options must be exercised subject to Paragraph 6(e) and in accordance with procedures established by the Committee from time to time but, subject to Paragraphs 6(b), 6(d) and 10(g), not earlier than the applicable Initial Exercise Date. Except as otherwise provided in this Award Agreement, reasonably promptly (but in no case more than 30 Business Days) after each date specified as the Initial Exercise Date on your Award Statement, the number or percentage of your Performance Options specified next to such Initial Exercise Date on the Award Statement that are Outstanding and Vested (which may be rounded to avoid fractional Shares) will become exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Award. If the applicable Initial Exercise Date is not during a Window Period, such Performance Options will become exercisable on a date specified by the Committee that is not more than 30 Business Days after the first Trading Day of the first Window Period that begins thereafter. For this purpose, a "Trading Day" is a day on which Shares trade regular way on the New York Stock Exchange. The Committee may from time to time prescribe periods during which the Vested Performance Options shall not be exercisable. In addition, the exercise procedures established by the Committee may require you to take specific steps in order to exercise your Performance Options within a minimum time prior to the effective date of exercise.

          (ii) the Committee determines that you failed to meet, in any respect, any obligation you may have under any agreement between you and the Firm, or any agreement entered into in connection with your Employment with the Firm, including, without limitation, the Firm's notice period requirement applicable to you, any offer letter, employment agreement or any shareholders' agreement to which other similarly situated employees of the Firm are a party;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are or become considered by GS Inc. to be one of its "covered employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, then you shall be subject to the provisions of Section 3.21.1 of the SIP and Section 6(d) of the Plan, as a result of which delivery of your Shares may be delayed.

     (b) In the discretion of the Committee, delivery of Shares (including Shares at Risk) may be made initially into an escrow account meeting such terms and conditions as are determined by the Firm and may be held in that escrow account until such time as the Committee has received such documentation as it may have requested or until the Committee has determined that any other conditions or restrictions on delivery of Shares required by this Award Agreement have been satisfied. By accepting your Performance Options, you have agreed on behalf of yourself (and your estate or other permitted beneficiary) that the Firm may establish and maintain an escrow account on such terms and conditions (which may include, without limitation, your (or your estate or beneficiary) executing any documents related to, and your (or your estate or beneficiary) paying for any costs associated with, such account) as the Firm may deem necessary or appropriate. Any such escrow arrangement shall, unless otherwise determined by the Firm, provide that (A) the escrow agent shall have the exclusive authority to vote such Shares while held in escrow and (B) dividends paid on such Shares held in escrow may be accumulated and shall be paid as determined by the Firm in its discretion.
     8. . The provisions of Section 2.3.5 of the SIP (which requires Award recipients to repay to the Firm amounts delivered to them if the Committee determines that all terms and conditions of this Award Agreement in respect of such exercise were not satisfied) shall apply to this Award. In addition, if any payment or delivery is made under this Award Agreement based on materially inaccurate financial statements (which includes, but is not limited to, statements of earnings, revenues or gains) or any other materially inaccurate performance criteria, you shall be obligated to repay to GS Inc., immediately upon demand therefor, any excess amount paid and/or any excess Shares delivered (or the Fair Market Value thereof), as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
