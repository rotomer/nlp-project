Full Year
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $13.71 billion for 2010, 37% lower than a particularly strong 2009. During 2010, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in a challenging environment characterized by lower client activity levels, which reflected broad market concerns including European sovereign debt risk and uncertainty over regulatory reform, as well as tighter bid/offer spreads. The decrease in net revenues compared with 2009 primarily reflected significantly lower results in interest rate products, credit products, commodities and, to a lesser extent, currencies. These decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues in mortgages, as 2009 included approximately $1 billion of losses on commercial mortgage-related products.
Net revenues in Equities were $8.09 billion for 2010, 25% lower than 2009, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in equities client execution, principally due to significantly lower results in derivatives and shares. Commissions and fees were also lower than 2009, primarily reflecting lower client activity levels. In addition, securities services net revenues were significantly lower compared with 2009, primarily reflecting tighter securities lending spreads, principally due to the impact of changes in the composition of customer balances, partially offset by the impact of higher average customer balances. During 2010, although equity markets were volatile during the first half of the year, equity prices generally improved and volatility levels declined in the second half of the year.
Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $3.64 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010, 31% lower than the fourth quarter of 2009 and 22% lower than the third quarter of 2010.
Fourth Quarter
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $1.64 billion, 48% lower than the fourth quarter of 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution continued to operate in a challenging environment characterized by generally low client activity levels, which resulted in lower net revenues across the franchise compared with the fourth quarter of 2009.
Table of Contents
Net revenues in Equities were $2.00 billion, 5% lower than the fourth quarter of 2009. This decrease reflected lower net revenues in equities client execution, as well as slightly lower commissions and fees, as client activity levels remained low during the quarter. Securities services net revenues were also lower, primarily reflecting tighter securities lending spreads, principally due to the impact of changes in the composition of customer balances, partially offset by the impact of higher average customer balances. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by lower volatility levels and an increase in global equity prices.
Investing & Lending
The firm's investing and lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equity securities, including private equity and real estate, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds, as well as lending activities.
Investing & Lending recorded net revenues of $7.54 billion for 2010. These results primarily reflected a gain of $747 million from the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), a net gain of $2.69 billion from other equity securities and a net gain of $2.60 billion from debt securities and loans.
Full Year

Fourth Quarter
Investment Management
Net revenues in Investment Management were $5.01 billion for 2010, 9% higher than 2009, primarily reflecting higher incentive fees across the firm's alternative investment products. Management and other fees also increased, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, as well as the impact of appreciation in the value of client assets. During the year, assets under management decreased 4% to $840 billion, primarily reflecting industry-wide outflows in money market assets.
Full Year
Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.51 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010, 14% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009 and 18% higher than the third quarter of 2010.

U.K. Bank Payroll Tax
During the second quarter of 2010, the United Kingdom enacted legislation that imposed a non-deductible 50% tax on certain financial institutions in respect of discretionary bonuses in excess of 25,000 awarded under arrangements made between December 9, 2009 and April 5, 2010 to "relevant banking employees." The estimated amount accrued in the second quarter of 2010 related to this tax was finalized during the fourth quarter at $465 million.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $10.43 billion for 2010, 14% higher than 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to the impact of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $682 million (including $550 million related to the SEC settlement), and an impairment of the firm's NYSE DMM rights of $305 million, each during 2010. The remainder of the increase compared with 2009 generally reflected higher professional fees, market development expenses and occupancy expenses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of significantly higher real estate impairment charges during 2009 related to the firm's consolidated entities held for investment purposes, as well as higher charitable contributions during 2009. During 2010, charitable contributions included $320 million to Goldman Sachs Gives. Compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution. The firm will ask its participating managing directors to make recommendations regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution.
Full Year
Non-compensation expenses were $3.05 billion, 11% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009 and 35% higher than the third quarter of 2010.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
Certain of the information regarding the firm's capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates. These estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.

For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
Certain of the information regarding the firm's capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates. These estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
