Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $357 million, 23% lower than the first quarter of 2010. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $912 million, 23% higher than the first quarter of 2010, due to strong net revenues in debt underwriting, which were significantly higher compared with the first quarter of 2010, as well as higher net revenues in equity underwriting.

Table of Contents
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $4.33 billion, 28% lower than a particularly strong first quarter of 2010. Client activity levels improved during the first quarter of 2011, resulting in solid performances in credit products, interest rate products, currencies and mortgages, although net revenues in each were lower compared with the first quarter of 2010. Net revenues in commodities were also solid and were higher compared with the same prior year period.
Net revenues in Equities were $2.32 billion, 7% lower than the first quarter of 2010, reflecting lower net revenues in equities client execution. The decline in equities client execution compared with the first quarter of 2010 reflected lower net revenues in derivatives and shares. This decrease was partially offset by higher commissions and fees, reflecting higher transaction volumes. Securities services net revenues were essentially unchanged compared with the first quarter of 2010. During the first quarter of 2011, Equities operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global equity prices and slightly lower average volatility levels.
Investing & Lending
Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $2.71 billion for the first quarter of 2011. These results generally reflected an increase in global equity prices and favorable credit markets during the quarter. Results for the first quarter of 2011 primarily included a gain of $316 million from the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), net gains of $1.05 billion from equity securities (excluding ICBC), and net gains and net interest of $1.02 billion from debt securities and loans.
Investment Management
Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.27 billion, 16% higher than the first quarter of 2010 and 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in net revenues compared with the first quarter of 2010 was primarily due to an increase in management and other fees, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, as well as higher incentive fees. Assets under management were $840 billion as of March 31, 2011, unchanged compared with the end of 2010, reflecting net market appreciation of $12 billion, offset by net outflows in money market and fixed income assets of $12 billion.
Operating expenses were $7.85 billion, 3% higher than the first quarter of 2010 and 52% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010.
Compensation and Benefits
The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits) was $5.23 billion for the first quarter of 2011, a 5% decline compared with the first quarter of 2010.

Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $2.62 billion, 23% higher than the first quarter of 2010 and 14% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase compared with the first quarter of 2010 reflected the impact of impairment charges of approximately $220 million related to assets classified as held for sale during the first quarter of 2011, primarily related to Litton Loan Servicing LP, the firm's residential mortgage servicing subsidiary. The remainder of the increase compared with the first quarter of 2010 generally reflected increased levels of business activity, including higher operating expenses related to the firm's consolidated entities held for investment purposes. The first quarter of 2011 also included net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $24 million.
Provision for Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2011 was 32.3%.

Book value per common share was $129.40 and tangible book value per common share was $119.63, both slightly higher compared with the end of 2010. Book value and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 536.1 million at period end.
(5)
During the quarter, the firm gave notice of redemption for the 50,000 shares of the firm's 10% Cumulative Perpetual Series G Preferred Stock. The redemption date was April 18, 2011. The redemption included a preferred dividend of $1.64 billion, which was included in the firm's results for the first quarter of 2011. The redemption also resulted in the acceleration of $24 million of preferred dividends related to the period from April 1, 2011 to the redemption date, which was included in the firm's results for the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the preferred dividend of $1.64 billion, both book value per common share and tangible book value per common shareincreased approximately 3% compared with the end of 2010.

Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements.
