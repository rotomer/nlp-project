Investment Banking

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $4.36 billion for 2011, 9% lower than 2010. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $1.99 billion, 4% lower than 2010. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $2.37 billion, 14% lower than 2010, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in equity underwriting, principally due to a decline in industry-wide activity.

Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $387 million, 56% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. Net revenues in both equity underwriting and debt underwriting were significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide activity.

Institutional Client Services
Full Year
Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $17.28 billion for 2011, 21% lower than 2010.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $9.02 billion for 2011, 34% lower than 2010. Although activity levels during 2011 were generally consistent with 2010 levels, and results were solid during the first quarter of 2011, the environment during the remainder of 2011 was characterized by broad market concerns and uncertainty, resulting in volatile markets and significantly wider credit spreads, which contributed to difficult market-making conditions and led to reductions in risk by the firm and its clients. As a result of these conditions, net revenues across the franchise were lower, including significant declines in mortgages and credit products, compared with 2010.
Net revenues in Equities were $8.26 billion for 2011, 2% higher than 2010. During 2011, average volatility levels increased and equity prices in Europe and Asia declined significantly, particularly during the third quarter. The increase in net revenues reflected higher commissions and fees, primarily due to higher transaction volumes, particularly during the third quarter of 2011. In addition, net revenues in securities services increased compared with 2010, reflecting the impact of higher average customer balances. Equities client execution net revenues were lower than 2010, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in shares.
The net gain attributable to the impact of changes in the firm's own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was approximately $600 million for 2011.
Fourth Quarter
Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $3.06 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010 and 25% lower than the third quarter of 2011.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $1.36 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, 17% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in net revenues compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 reflected lower results in mortgages and credit products as continued global economic uncertainty contributed to difficult market-making conditions. These decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues in interest rate products and, to a lesser extent, commodities and currencies.
Net revenues in Equities were $1.69 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, 15% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting lower net revenues in equities client execution, as well as lower commissions and fees. The decline in equities client execution compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 primarily reflected lower net revenues in derivatives. Securities services net revenues were higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in the composition of customer balances. Although global equity prices generally increased during the quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by lower activity levels.

Investing & Lending
Full Year
Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $2.14 billion for 2011. Results for 2011 included a loss of $517 million from the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and net gains of $1.12 billion from other investments in equities, primarily in private equity positions, partially offset by losses from public equities. In addition, Investing & Lending included net revenues of $96 million from debt securities and loans. This amount includes approximately $1 billion of unrealized losses related to relationship lending activities, including the effect of hedges, offset by net interest income and net gains from other debt securities and loans. Results for 2011 also included other net revenues of $1.44 billion, principally related to the firm's consolidated entities held for investment purposes.
Fourth Quarter
Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $872 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. Results for the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily included a gain of $388 million from the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, net gains of $384 million from other investments in equities, primarily in public equities, and other net revenues of $321 million, principally related to the firm's consolidated entities held for investment purposes. These results were partially offset by net losses of $221 million from debt securities and loans, primarily reflecting approximately $450 million of unrealized losses related to relationship lending activities, including the effect of hedges, partially offset by net interest income.
Investment Management
Full Year
Net revenues in Investment Management were $5.03 billion for 2011, essentially unchanged compared with 2010, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets under management, offset by lower incentive fees. During the year, assets under management decreased $12 billion to $828 billion, reflecting net outflows of $17 billion, partially offset by net market appreciation of $5 billion. Net outflows primarily reflected outflows in fixed income and equity assets, partially offset by inflows in money market assets.
Fourth Quarter
Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.26 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011, 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010 and 3% higher than the third quarter of 2011. The decrease in net revenues compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 was primarily due to lower incentive fees. During the quarter, assets under management increased $7 billion to $828 billion, reflecting net market appreciation of $15 billion in equity and fixed income assets, partially offset by net outflows of $8 billion. Net outflows primarily reflected outflows in fixed income and equity assets, partially offset by inflows in money market assets.

Operating expenses were $22.64 billion for 2011, 14% lower than 2010.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits) were $12.22 billion for 2011, a 21% decline compared with $15.38 billion for 2010. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2011 was 42.4%. Total staff
(4)
 decreased 7% compared with the end of 2010.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Full Year
Non-compensation expenses were $10.42 billion for 2011, essentially unchanged compared with 2010. Non-compensation expenses for 2011 included higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, increased reserves related to the firm's insurance business and higher market development expenses compared with 2010. These increases were offset by lower other expenses during 2011. The decrease in other expenses primarily reflected lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings (2010 included $550 million related to a settlement with the SEC).
Fourth Quarter
Non-compensation expenses were $2.59 billion, 15% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010 and 5% lower than the third quarter of 2011. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 was primarily due to the impact of an impairment of the firm's New York Stock Exchange Designated Market Maker rights of $305 million during the fourth quarter of 2010 and higher charitable contributions during the fourth quarter of 2010. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of impairments on consolidated investments of approximately $170 million during the fourth quarter of 2011.
The fourth quarter of 2011 included $47 million of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and $78 million of charitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives. Compensation was reduced to fund the charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. This amount is in addition to prior year contributions made to Goldman Sachs Gives.
Provision for Taxes
The effective income tax rate for 2011 was 28.0%
(5)
, down from 30.3% for the first nine months of 2011. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to an increase in permanent benefits as a percentage of earnings and the earnings mix.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
Certain of the information regarding the firm's capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates. These estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.

Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
