(f) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Guarantor's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Guarantor's debt securities;

9. (a) Each of the Guarantor and the Trust, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the engagement of the Agents pursuant to, or the performance by the Agents of the services contemplated by, this Agreement, and will reimburse each Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability
provided
however
 
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor by any Agent through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and , , that neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be liable under clause (ii) to the extent that such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Agents.
provided
further
(b) Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Guarantor and the Trust against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Guarantor or the Trust may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Pricing Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement thereto, the Pricing Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by such Agent through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Guarantor and the Trust for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or
 
claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Agents on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Guarantor and the Trust bear to the total commissions received by the Agents, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand or the Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Guarantor, the Trust and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
 
fraudulent misrepresentation. The Agents' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in the same proportion as their entitlements to the commissions set forth in Section 2 and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Guarantor and the Trust under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Guarantor and the Trust may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Agent; and the obligations of the Agents under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Agents may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Guarantor or the Trust and to each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor within the meaning of the Act.
10. Any Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Guarantor or the Trust may remove any Agent, by giving prior written notice to, in the case of a resignation, the Guarantor and the Trust, and, in the case of a removal, the removed Agent. The provisions of Sections 7 and 9 shall survive the resignation or removal of an Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Guarantor and the Trust and the Agents, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any Agent, or the Guarantor and the Trust, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Guarantor or the Trust, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the indemnity agreement of the Trust and the Guarantor in subsection (a) of Section 9 hereof, the representations and warranties in subsections (b) and (c) of Section 1 hereof and any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained in any certificate furnished by the Guarantor or the Trust pursuant to Section 8 hereof, insofar as they may constitute a basis for indemnification for liabilities (other than payment by the Guarantor and the Trust of expenses incurred or paid in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) arising under the Act, shall not extend to the extent of any interest therein of a controlling person or partner of an Agent who is a director or officer of the Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement or a controlling person of the Guarantor or the Trust when the Registration Statement has become effective, except in each case to the extent that an interest of such character shall have been determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction as not against public policy as expressed in the Act. Unless in the opinion of counsel for the Guarantor and the Trust the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, the Guarantor and the Trust will, if a claim for such indemnification is asserted, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such interest is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
13. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall then be under any liability to any Agent except as
 
provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Trust as provided herein, the Guarantor and the Trust will reimburse the Agents through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Agents in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Guarantor and the Trust shall then be under no further liability to any Agent except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
14. In all dealings hereunder, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (and only Goldman, Sachs & Co.) shall act on behalf of each of the Agents (including with respect to any determination as to whether any condition to the obligations of the Agents has been satisfied, any representation or agreement of the Guarantor has been complied with or any such condition, representation or agreement may be waived), and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Agent made or given by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Agents shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the Representative, c/o Goldman, Sachs & Co., at 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Guarantor or the Trust shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Guarantor or the Trust set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to an Agent pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Agent at its address set forth in its Agents' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Guarantor and the Trust by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
provided
however
15. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Agents, the Guarantor, the Trust and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Guarantor and the Trust and each person who controls the Guarantor, the Trust or any Agent, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
16. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
17. The Guarantor and the Trust acknowledge and agrees that (i) no Agent has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Guarantor or the Trust with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Agent has advised or is currently advising the Guarantor or the Trust on other matters) or any other obligation to the Guarantor or the Trust except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (ii) the Guarantor and the Trust have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate. The Guarantor and the Trust agree that they will not claim that the Agents, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature
 
or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Guarantor or the Trust, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. The duties and obligations of the Agents shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Agents, the Agents may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Agents shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Agents, acting under this Agreements, shall incur no liability to the Guarantor or the Trust in its individual capacity or as Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct on its part.
18. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Guarantor and the Trust, on the one hand, and the Agents, or any of them, on the other hand, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
19. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
20. The Guarantor, the Trust and each of the Agents hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
21. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
22. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Guarantor and the Trust are authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Guarantor or the Trust relating to that treatment and structure, without the Agents imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us four counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Agents, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Agents, the Guarantor and the Trust. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Agents is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Agents, the form of which shall be submitted to the Guarantor and the Trust for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
As Representative of the Agents,
200 West Street,
New York, New York 10282.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of 1,750,010 4.647% Senior Guaranteed Trust Securities, liquidation amount $1,000 per security (the "Securities"), of Murray Street Investment Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), and the related guarantee thereof by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), which is the sponsor of the Trust and the guarantor under the Guarantee Agreement referred to below.
The Registration Statement relating to the Securities and the related securities (including the Notes and the Guarantee (each as defined in the Prospectus Supplement referred to below and, collectively, the "Related Securities")) (File Nos. 333-176914) was filed on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus, dated February 16, 2012 (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated March 5 2012 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Base Prospectus. The Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
,
In accordance with our understanding with you as to the scope of our services under the circumstances applicable to the offering of the Securities, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated March 5, 2012, the Final Term Sheet, dated March 5, 2012 (the "Final Term Sheet") and filed pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act (such Final Term Sheet, taken together with the Base Prospectus and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and the Prospectus Supplement and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Guarantor, its counsel, special Delaware counsel to the Trust and Goldman Sachs Capital II, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Note Seller"), and the Guarantor's accountants and advised you as to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Guarantor, its counsel, special Delaware counsel to the Trust and the Note Seller and the Guarantor's accountants concerning certain matters relating to the Guarantor and the Trust and
 
reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Guarantor and the administrative trustees of the Trust, opinions addressed to you from an Associate General Counsel of the Guarantor and special Delaware counsel to the Trust and the Note Seller and a letter addressed to you from the Guarantor's accountants.
On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of the prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we advised you and now confirm that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, and the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
 
 
 
We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of the prior paragraph has caused us to believe that the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
In addition, we do not know of any litigation or any governmental proceeding instituted or threatened against the Company that was required to be disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 when such Report was filed and was not so disclosed. We call to your attention, however, the fact that the Company has an internal legal department and that, while we represent the Company on a regular basis, our engagement has been limited to specific matters as to which we were consulted by the Company
 
and, accordingly, our knowledge with respect to litigation and governmental proceedings instituted or threatened against the Company is similarly limited. Also, insofar as the offering of the Securities is concerned, we do not know of any documents that were required to be filed as exhibits to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 when such Report was filed and were not so filed.
The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, any Post-Effective Amendment thereto, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement except for those made under the captions "Description of the Trust, the Senior Guaranteed Securities, the Guarantee and the Notes" and "Plan of Distribution" in the Prospectus Supplement insofar as they relate to provisions of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, the Guarantee Agreement and the Indenture (as each of those terms are defined in the Prospectus Supplement), as well as the Distribution Agreement therein described. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, any Post-Effective Amendment thereto, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement, as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, any Post-Effective amendment thereto, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the statements of the eligibility of the respective Trustees under the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, the Indenture and the Guarantee Agreement under which the Securities and certain of the Related Securities are being issued.
This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Agents, to you, as Representative of the Agents, solely for the benefit of the Agents in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities or the Related Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities or the Related Securities.
 
1. The Guarantor has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware;
2. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantor;
3. The Junior Subordinated Notes have been duly authorized, executed, issued and delivered;
4. The Guarantor Agreements have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantor.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that such counsel expresses no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; that, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, such counsel has relied upon certificates of officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials and other sources believed by such counsel to be responsible; and that such counsel has assumed that each Guarantor Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each party thereto other than the Guarantor, that the Junior Subordinated Notes conform to the forms thereof examined by such counsel (or members of the legal department of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries acting under such counsel's supervision), that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Junior Subordinated Notes have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized signatories and that the signatures on all documents examined by such counsel (or members of the legal department of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries acting under such counsel's supervision) are genuine, assumptions that such counsel has not independently verified. In addition, such counsel may state that such counsel has examined, or has caused members of the legal department of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries acting under such counsel's supervision to examine, such corporate and partnership records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as such counsel has considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of such opinion.

(i) They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Guarantor within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "") and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "");

(v) They have compared the information in the Prospectus under selected captions with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of Items 301, 302 and 503(d), respectively, of Regulation S-K;

(F) for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus to the specified date referred to in clause (E) there were any decreases in consolidated total revenues or consolidated revenues, net of interest expense, pre-tax earnings or net earnings or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the comparable items in the comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Representative, except in each case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter insert if applicable  and except that, because no final consolidated income statement information was available for that period, the accountants are unable to provide an opinion as to whether there have been any such decreases or increases; and

The Paying Agent shall initially be the Bank, and any co-paying agent chosen by the Bank, and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees. Any Person acting as Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days' written notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee. In the event that the Bank shall no longer be the Paying Agent or a successor Paying Agent shall resign or its authority to act be revoked, the Administrative Trustees shall appoint a successor that is reasonably acceptable to the Property Trustee and the Sponsor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company).

Section 5.12
Rights of Holders.

division of property, profits or rights of the Issuer Trust except as described below. The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust Declaration. The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights and, when issued and delivered to Holders against payment of the purchase price therefor will be fully paid and nonassessable undivided beneficial interests in Trust Property. The Holders, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
(b) For so long as any Trust Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Note Event of Default, the Note Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes fail to declare the principal of all of the Notes to be immediately due and payable, the Property Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities then Outstanding shall have such right, which may be exercised by giving notice in writing to the Sponsor and the Note Trustee with a copy to the Property Trustee, in the case of notice by the Holders of the Trust Securities, or to the Sponsor, the Notes Trustee and the Holders of the Trust Securities, in the case of notice by the Property Trustee; and upon any such declaration such principal amount of and the accrued interest on all of the Notes shall become immediately due and payable, that the payment of principal and interest on such Notes shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in the Indenture.
provided
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Notes has been made by the Holders of Trust Securities and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Note Trustee as provided in the Indenture, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Trust Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Sponsor and the Note Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(i) the Sponsor has paid or deposited with the Note Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue interest on all of the Notes,
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Notes that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Notes, and
(C) all sums paid or advanced by the Note Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Note Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(ii) all Note Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Notes that has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513 of the Indenture.
The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Trust Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Trust Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest
 
(unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all overdue interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Note Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision which under Article IX of the Original Indenture, as modified by the Supplemental Indenture, cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Note. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of the Trust Securities, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Trust Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.12(b).
provided
(c) For so long as any Trust Securities remain Outstanding, upon an Event of Default described in clause (b) or (c) of the definition of such term (unless the Sponsor shall have made payment of the defaulted amount pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement) or an Event of Default described in clause (d) of the definition of such term, the Property Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities then Outstanding shall have the right to declare the entire Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities to be immediately due and payable, which may be exercised by giving notice in writing to the Sponsor with a copy to the Property Trustee, in the case of notice by the Holders of the Trust Securities, or to the Sponsor and the Holders of the Trust Securities, in the case of notice by the Property Trustee; and upon any such declaration such Liquidation Amount of and the accrued Distributions on all of the Trust Securities shall become immediately due and payable.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Trust Securities has been made by the Holders of Trust Securities and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Property Trustee or by the Guarantee Trustee pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Trust Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee and the Sponsor, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(i) the Sponsor has paid or deposited with the Property Trustee or the Guarantee Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue amounts on all of the Trust Securities, and
 
(B) all sums paid or advanced by the Property Trustee hereunder or by the Guarantee Trustee under the Guarantee Agreement and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, the Guarantee Trustee and their agents and counsel; and
(ii) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities that has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided herein.
The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Trust Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Trust Securities, waive any past default hereunder, except a payment default (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all overdue distributions on the Trust Securities has been deposited with the Property Trustee or the Guarantee Trustee).
Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of the Trust Securities, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Trust Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.12(c).
provided
(d) For so long as any Trust Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Declaration and the Indenture, upon a Note Event of Default specified in Section 501(1) or 501(2) of the Indenture, any Holder of Trust Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Sponsor, pursuant to Section 2.12 of the Supplemental Indenture for enforcement of payment to such Holder of the principal amount of or premium (if any) or interest on Notes having a principal amount equal to the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities of such Holder (a "").

CUSIP Numbers.
The Issuer Trust in issuing the Trust Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Property Trustee shall indicate the "CUSIP" numbers of the Trust Securities in notices of redemption and related materials as a convenience to Holders;
 
that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Trust Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and related materials.

The Issuer Trustees shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of Trust Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of Trust Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Trust Securities of any notice of default received from the Note Trustee with respect to the Notes. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Trust Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Property Trustee shall, at the expense of the Sponsor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action shall not cause the Issuer Trust to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation or as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes.

Holders of at least 50% of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Outstanding Trust Securities, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Holders of Trust Securities.
If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Holders of record present, in person or by proxy, holding at least a majority of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Outstanding Trust Securities held by the Holders of record present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Holders of Trust Securities, unless this Issuer Trust Declaration requires a greater number of affirmative votes.

provided
 
proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Holder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution.
Section 6.7

Section 6.9
Acts of Holders.

Section 7.2
Representations and Warranties of Sponsor.
The Sponsor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Holders that the Trust Securities Certificates issued on the Closing Date on behalf of the Issuer Trust have been duly authorized and will have been, duly and validly executed, issued and delivered by the Issuer Trustees pursuant to the terms and provisions of, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Trust Declaration and the Holders will be, as of each such date, entitled to the benefits of this Trust Declaration.
Section 8.1
Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
(a) The duties and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees shall be as provided by this Trust Declaration and, in the case of the Property Trustee, by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Trust Declaration shall require any of the Issuer Trustees to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Declaration relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Issuer Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE VIII. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Issuer Trustee has duties and liabilities relating to the Issuer Trust or to the Holders, such Issuer Trustee shall not be liable to the Issuer Trust or to any Holder for such Issuer Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Declaration. Except as otherwise required by the Trust Indenture Act and the Commission's rules and regulations thereunder applicable to indentures qualified under such Act, the provisions of this Trust Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Issuer Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Sponsor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Issuer Trustees.
(b) All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Issuer Trustees are not personally liable to it for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Issuer Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Declaration or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act.
 
(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall enforce this Trust Declaration for the benefit of the Holders.
(d) The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Trust Declaration (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and no implied covenants shall be read into this Trust Declaration against the Property Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 513 of the Original Indenture or Section 5.12(c) hereof), the Property Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Declaration, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
(e) No provision of this Trust Declaration shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred:
(A) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Trust Declaration (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Trust Declaration (including pursuant to Section 10.10); and
(B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Property Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Trust Declaration; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof or of the Trust Indenture Act are specifically required to be furnished to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform on their face to the requirements of this Trust Declaration;
(ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
(iii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Trust Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Declaration;
 
(iv) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Notes and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Declaration and the Trust Indenture Act;
(v) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree in writing with the Sponsor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law;
(vi) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Sponsor with their respective duties under this Trust Declaration, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of the Administrative Trustees or the Sponsor; and
(vii) subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Trust Declaration shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Property Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Trust Declaration or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(f) The Administrative Trustees shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the other Issuer Trustees or the Sponsor with their respective duties under this Trust Declaration, nor shall any Administrative Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Administrative Trustee, the other Issuer Trustees or the Sponsor.
Section 8.2
Certain Notices.
Within 30 days after the occurrence of any Event of Default actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such Event of Default to the Holders, the Administrative Trustees and the Sponsor, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived.
Within five Business Days after the receipt of written notice of the Sponsor's exercise of its right to defer the payment of interest on the Notes pursuant to the Indenture, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such exercise to the Holders, unless such exercise shall have been revoked.
The Property Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of an Event of Default unless the Property Trustee shall have received written notice or a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee charged with the administration of this Trust Declaration shall have obtained actual knowledge of such Event of Default.

The Relevant Trustee shall appoint a successor by requesting from at least three Persons meeting the eligibility requirements its expenses and charges to serve as the Relevant Trustee on a form provided by the Administrative Trustees, and selecting the Person who agrees to the lowest expenses and charges. If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Issuer
 
Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Sponsor, in the case of the Property Trustee, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
The Administrative Trustees, or any of them, may be removed at any time by the Sponsor.
The Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed by Act of the Holders of at least a majority of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Outstanding Trust Securities, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and, in the case of the Property Trustee, on behalf of the Issuer Trust) (i) for cause (including upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in subparagraph (d) of the definition thereof with respect to the Relevant Trustee), or (ii) at any time if a Note Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Unless and until a Note Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed at any time by the Sponsor.
If a resigning Property Trustee or Delaware Trustee shall fail to appoint a successor, or if the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee shall be removed or become incapable of acting as Issuer Trustee, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee for any cause, the Sponsor or, if a Note Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holders of the Trust Securities, by Act of the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities then Outstanding delivered to such Relevant Trustee, may appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Issuer Trustees, and such successor Issuer Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Sponsor or the Holders of the Trust Securities, as the case may be, and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Holder, on behalf of such Holder and all others similarly situated, or any other Issuer Trustee, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
The Property Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of an Issuer Trustee and each appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee to all Holders in the manner provided in Section 10.8 and shall give notice to the Sponsor and the Administrative Trustees. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Trust Declaration, in the event any Administrative Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes, in the opinion of the Sponsor, incompetent or incapacitated, or resigns and fails to appoint a successor, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence, incapacity or resignation may be filled by appointment by the remaining Administrative Trustees.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We are acting as counsel to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and to Murray Street Investment Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), in connection with the issuance and delivery on the date hereof of $1,750,010,000 aggregate liquidation amount of the Trust's 4.647% Senior Guaranteed Trust Securities due 2017 ("Trust Securities"), each representing an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the issuing Trust; guarantees of the Company, on a senior basis, to the extent provided therein, with respect to the payment of distributions on and the redemption price or liquidation amount of the Trust Securities ("Trust Guarantees"); and $1,750,010,000 aggregate principal amount of Series MS-1 Remarketed 4.647% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2017, issued by the Company and purchased by the Trust on the date hereof in connection with the issuance by the Trust of Trust Securities having corresponding payment terms ("Notes" and, collectively with the Trust Guarantees, the "Company Securities"). The Trust Securities and the Company Securities are referred to collectively as the "Securities". The Company and the Trust filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on February 16, 2012, a post-effective amendment to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-176914) (as so amended, the "Registration Statement") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") relating to the proposed offer and sale of an unspecified liquidation amount of the Trust Securities and the Trust Guarantees. The Trust Guarantees with respect to the Trust Securities of the Trust are being issued under a guarantee agreement, dated as of March 9, 2012 (the "Guarantee Agreement"), between the Company and The
 
 
Bank of New York Mellon, as guarantee trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee"). The Notes are being issued under the indenture, dated as of February 20, 2004, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 15, 2007, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 6, 2012, and the Sixth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 9, 2012, each between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee") (such Indenture, as so supplemented, the "Indenture").
In rendering this opinion, we have examined the following documents:
 
 
 
 
 
We also have examined such questions of law as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, we advise you that, in our opinion, the Trust Guarantees and the Notes constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
In rendering the foregoing opinion, we are not passing upon, and assume no responsibility for, any disclosure in the Registration Statement or any related prospectus or other offering material regarding the Company, the Trust or the Securities or their offering and sale.
We have relied as to certain matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible. We have assumed, without independent verification, that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Guarantee Agreement has
 
 
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantee Trustee, that the Notes conform to the specimen thereof examined by us, that the Trust Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Trust under the laws of the State of Delaware, that the Trustee's certificate of authentication of the Notes has been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to us under the heading "Validity of the Securities" in the prospectus contained therein. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act.
