Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 17, 2012, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the firm) reported its earnings for its first quarter ended March 31, 2012. A copy of Group Inc.'s press release containing this information is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Group Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On April 17, 2012, Group Inc. reported net revenues of $9.95 billion and net earnings of $2.11 billion for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012. Diluted earnings per common share were $3.92 compared with $1.56
(1)
 for the first quarter of 2011 and $1.84 for the fourth quarter of 2011. Annualized return on average common shareholders' equity (ROE)
(2)
 was 12.2% for the first quarter of 2012.
Investment Banking
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.15 billion, 9% lower than the first quarter of 2011 and 35% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $489 million, 37% higher than the first quarter of 2011. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $665 million, 27% lower than the first quarter of 2011. Net revenues in equity underwriting were significantly lower than the first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting a decline in industry-wide activity. Net revenues in debt underwriting were lower compared with a strong first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting a decline in leveraged finance activity. The firm's investment banking transaction backlog was essentially unchanged compared with the end of 2011.
(3)
Institutional Client Services
Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $5.71 billion, 14% lower than the first quarter of 2011 and 87% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011.
Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $3.46 billion, 20% lower than a solid first quarter of 2011, as higher net revenues in interest rate products were more than offset by lower net revenues in the other major businesses. During the first quarter of 2012, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in an environment generally characterized by tighter credit spreads and improved activity levels compared with the fourth quarter of 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents
Net revenues in Equities were $2.25 billion, 3% lower than the first quarter of 2011, as higher net revenues in equities client execution, reflecting an increase in derivatives, were more than offset by lower commissions and fees, consistent with lower market volumes. Securities services net revenues were essentially unchanged compared with the first quarter of 2011. During the first quarter of 2012, Equities operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global equity prices and lower volatility levels compared with the fourth quarter of 2011.
The net loss attributable to the impact of changes in the firm's own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was approximately $225 million for the first quarter of 2012.
Investing & Lending
Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $1.91 billion for the first quarter of 2012. An increase in global equity prices and tighter credit spreads contributed to positive results in Investing & Lending. Results for the first quarter of 2012 included a gain of $169 million from the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), net gains of $891 million from other investments in equities (with public and private equities each contributing approximately one-half of the net gains), net gains and net interest of $585 million from debt securities and loans, and other net revenues of $266 million, principally related to the firm's consolidated entities held for investment purposes.
Investment Management
Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.18 billion, 8% lower than the first quarter of 2011 and 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease in net revenues compared with the first quarter of 2011 was primarily due to lower management and other fees and lower transaction revenues. During the quarter, assets under management decreased $4 billion to $824 billion, reflecting net outflows of $26 billion, including net outflows in money market assets and, to a lesser extent, equity and alternative investment assets. This decrease was partially offset by net market appreciation of $22 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets.
 
Table of Contents
Operating expenses were $6.77 billion, 14% lower than the first quarter of 2011 and 41% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011.
Compensation and Benefits
The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits) was $4.38 billion for the first quarter of 2012, a 16% decline compared with the first quarter of 2011. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for the first quarter of 2012 was 44.0%. Total staff
 (4)
 decreased 3% compared with the end of 2011.
Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses were $2.39 billion, 9% lower than the first quarter of 2011 and 8% lower than the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease compared with the first quarter of 2011 reflected lower impairment charges, lower market development expenses, principally reflecting the impact of expense reduction initiatives, lower occupancy expenses and lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees. These decreases were partially offset by increased reserves related to the firm's insurance business. The first quarter of 2012 included impairment charges related to consolidated investments of $116 million and net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $59 million.
Provision for Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2012 was 33.7%, up from 28.0% for 2011. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the earnings mix and a decrease in the impact of permanent benefits.
As of March 31, 2012, total capital was $243.25 billion, consisting of $71.66 billion in total shareholders' equity (common shareholders' equity of $68.56 billion and preferred stock of $3.10 billion) and $171.59 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $134.48 and tangible book value per common share
(5)
 was $123.94, both approximately 3% higher compared with the end of 2011. Book value and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements, of 509.8 million at period end.
During the quarter, the firm repurchased 3.3 million shares of its common stock at an average cost per share of $111.28, for a total cost of $362 million. The remaining share authorization under the firm's existing repurchase program is 60.3 million shares.
(6)
Under the regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to bank holding companies (Basel 1), the firm's Tier 1 capital ratio
(7)
 was 14.7% and the firm's Tier 1 common ratio
(8) 
was 12.9% as of March 31, 2012, up from 13.8% and 12.1%, respectively, as of the end of 2011.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Certain of the information regarding the firm's capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, level 3 assets and global core excess liquidity consist of preliminary estimates. These estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.
Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.  |  200 West Street  |  New York, New York 10282
 
NEW YORK, April 17, 2012  The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today reported net revenues of $9.95 billion and net earnings of $2.11 billion for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012. Diluted earnings per common share were $3.92 compared with $1.56

"We are pleased with the firm's solid performance for the quarter," said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Stronger global markets, together with the firm's deep and broad client franchise, drove improved results across most of our businesses. Because client activity remains relatively low in certain areas, especially in parts of Investment Banking, we believe that our mix of businesses gives the firm significant room for revenue growth as economic and market conditions continue to improve."
