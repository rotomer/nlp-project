The fair and market value of the Shares on September 12, 2002 is $12.20 per share as set forth in a written opinion from Duff & Phelps LLP dated September 12, 2002. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Investment Committee, in its capacity as the primary fiduciary in respect of the Plans, hereby accepts the contribution of the Shares on behalf of the Plans and directs the Company to issue certificates representing the Shares to the Directed Trust. Wingfoot Corporation, in its capacity as Trustee of the Pension Trust, acknowledges the contribution of the Shares to the Plans. The Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The Shares may not be offered, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except (i) in compliance with an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act and any state securities or similar laws and in conformance in all respects with all other applicable provisions of the Act and other applicable laws, and then, only after the Company shall have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it to the effect
that the Shares may be offered, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in compliance with such applicable exemption, or (ii) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act and in compliance with any applicable registration, qualification or other requirements of applicable state securities and similar laws. The Directed Trust, acting through Northern Trust Company ("Northern") in its capacity as trustee of the Directed Trust (the "Trustee"), and Northern, acting in its capacity as the investment manager/advisor to the Directed Trust (the "Advisor") hereby (i) accepts the Shares on behalf, and for the benefit, of the Plans as assets of the Directed Trust, (ii) acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under the Act, (iii) confirms that it is authorized to accept the Shares and to hold the Shares in accordance with the requirements of this letter agreement, and (iv) agrees (on its behalf and on behalf of any successor or permitted assign or transferee) that it will offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the Shares only in accordance with the conditions set forth in this letter agreement. The Company agrees that, upon the request of Northern acting in its capacity as the Trustee and the Advisor, the Company will enter into a "Registration Rights Agreement" with respect to all shares of the Common Stock, without par value, of the Company (the "Common Stock") acquired by the Pension Plans from the Company (including the Shares and the shares of Common Stock contributed on September 10, 2001 to the Pension Trust) and held by the Directed Trust in the form, appropriately completed, of Exhibit A hereto or in such other form and containing such other terms and conditions as Goodyear, the Trustee and the Advisor may mutually agree. The Directed Trust represents that it is authorized to accept, own and hold the Shares and that it will not dispose of, or cause the disposition of, the Shares except in accordance with the terms of the Directed Trust and its obligations under this Agreement. Northern agrees that, as Trustee, it will hold title to the Shares and that, as Trustee and Advisor, it will not dispose of, or cause the disposition of, the Shares except in accordance with the terms of the Directed Trust and its obligations under this Agreement. Northern, whether acting in its capacity as Trustee or as Advisor, shall not offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the Shares (or any of them), except: (i) in compliance with an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act and any applicable state securities and similar laws, and then only after the Company shall have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company that the Shares (or such portion of them) may be offered, sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, as the case may be, in compliance with such applicable exemption(s); or (ii) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act and in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement. The Company agrees that it will file on a timely basis all current, quarterly and annual reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at any time while the Shares are owned by the Directed Trust. 2
Northern hereby acknowledges: (i) the transfer of the Shares to the Directed Trust; (ii) that the Shares have not been registered under the Act and constitute "restricted securities" within the meaning of that term as defined in Rule 144 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Act; and (iii) the Company has determined that the holding period under Rule 144(d) (1) promulgated under the Act starts on the date hereof. Unless the Registration Rights Agreement has been entered into by the Company and an effective registration statement relating to the Shares is in effect under the Act, and the offer and sale of the Shares is effected, as contemplated thereby, Northern, whether acting in its capacity as Trustee or as Advisor, agrees to offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the Shares only in compliance with an available exemption from the registration provisions of the Act and similar laws and regulations and with the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the legend on the Shares, a copy of which is set forth as Schedule I hereto. If the Shares are not the subject of an effective registration statement under the Act and the Directed Trust, acting through Northern as Trustee and/or Advisor (or any successor to the Advisor), offers and sells any of the Shares at a time and in a manner that would be in all respects in accordance with all applicable provisions of Rule 144 (including paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (k) of Rule 144), the Shares then being offered and sold may be transferred, subject to compliance with said applicable provisions of Rule 144 and any applicable state laws, without a legend and without being subject to the following provisions of this Agreement. If the Shares are not the subject of an effective registration statement under the Act and the Directed Trust, acting through Northern as Trustee and/or Advisor, desires to sell, or to transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of, any of the Shares in a transaction not in compliance with Rule 144, such transaction shall be effected only if there is, and only in accordance with, an available exemption from the registration provisions of the Act and each party that proposes to acquire any Shares (each a "Transferee") shall be required to enter into an agreement with the Company, and Northern in its capacity as the Trustee of the Directed Trust, providing, among other things, that: (a) it will not offer, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares owned or otherwise acquired or held by such Transferee except pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act and other applicable laws and until the Company shall have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company to the effect that no registration under the Act and/or any applicable state securities laws is required in order to lawfully effect the transaction contemplated because of the applicability of an exemption or exemptions from registration under the Act and each other applicable securities law and that the transaction will be effected in accordance with any and all conditions of such exemptions, and will cause each certificate evidencing the Shares to bear a legend substantially in the form of Schedule I hereto; (b) in the case of any proposed disposition of any of the Shares, it will deliver to the Company prior to such disposition such documentation regarding the proposed disposition as the Company may reasonably request; (c) it will agree to offer, sell, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the Shares only pursuant to (i) an exemption from registration under the Act provided by Rule 144 thereunder (if available) or (ii) another applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act, in each case in conformance with all applicable securities laws of the United States and any state thereof; and (d) except in the case of a sale pursuant to Rule 144, shall agree that it will provide written notice to any subsequent purchaser or transferee of the 3
Shares of the resale restrictions contained in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph and require any purchaser or other transferee of any Shares to agree in writing to the resale restrictions set forth in this letter Agreement, or, in the case of any disposition of Shares in accordance with Rule 144 under the Act, shall agree that it will promptly notify the Company of such intended disposition and shall deliver to the Company an executed copy of any notice on Form 144 required to be filed by the transferor with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Northern hereby: (i) agrees that as Trustee it will identify the Shares on its books and records relating to the Directed Trust as "restricted securities", (ii) confirms that under the Directed Trust, whether acting as Trustee or Advisor, it cannot, and agrees that it will not, offer, sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any Shares except in accordance with the requirements set forth in this Agreement; and (iii) agrees that in the event that Northern, as Advisor, or any other successor or investment advisor or investment manager authorized to give directions under the Directed Trust, directs Trustee to offer and sell, settle the sale of, or to otherwise effect any assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition of, any Shares, it will not deliver any Shares (other than pursuant to a transaction covered by an effective registration statement under the Act and in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement) until it has received confirmation from the Company that the relevant transaction(s) will be effected in compliance with an available exemption from the registration provisions of the Act and similar laws and regulations and with the conditions set forth in this Agreement or pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act and in accordance with the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement. Northern may conclusively rely, without duty of inquiry, upon such confirmation from any officer of, or attorney representing, the Company. This letter agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and shall be binding on the successors and permitted assigns of the Directed Trust, the Trustee and the Advisor. The Directed Trust shall not assign this letter agreement or any of their respective duties, obligations, rights or interests under this letter agreement without the express prior written consent of the Company.

Each Transfer Notice shall specify the proposed timetable for the Transfer. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Issuer may postpone the filing or effectiveness of any Registration Statement, or suspend the use of any Prospectus included therein, at any time if the Issuer determines, in its reasonable judgment, that (i) appropriate financial statements will not be available when a Transfer is proposed to be made, or (ii) that such filing, effectiveness or proposed Transfer would (1) materially interfere with any proposal or plan by the Issuer or any of its Affiliates to engage in a material acquisition, merger, consolidation, tender offer, securities offering or other material transaction, significant work on which had commenced prior to receipt by the Issuer of the Transfer Notice relating to the proposed Transfer or (2) would require the Issuer to make a public disclosure of previously non-public information. Upon receipt by the Issuer of a Transfer Notice, the Issuer shall promptly notify the Investment Advisor, the Retirement Trust and the Pension Plans of any postponement or suspension pursuant to this paragraph. The Issuer agrees that it will terminate any such postponement or suspension as promptly as reasonably practicable, consistent with the consummation of such transactions and the ripeness for and appropriateness of public disclosure of the non-public information (as applicable), and will promptly notify the Investment Advisor, the Retirement Trust and the Pension Plans of such termination. In making any such determination to initiate or terminate a postponement or suspension, the Issuer shall not be required to consult with the Pension Plans, the Retirement Trust or the Investment Advisor and any such determination shall be Issuer's responsibility alone, and neither the Pension Plans nor the Retirement Trust nor the Investment Advisor shall have any responsibility or liability therefor. 4
(d) The Investment Advisor agrees that it will not cause the Retirement Trust to make any transfer of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement other than in accordance with the plan of distribution described therein and that it will keep (and will cause any Underwriter or other person acting on its behalf to keep) strictly confidential any information provided to them in connection with the Issuer's exercise of its rights under Section 3(c) hereof or otherwise provided to the Investment Advisor, or any person acting on its behalf, hereunder. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the Investment Advisor from causing the Retirement Trust to effect any Transfer of Registrable Securities otherwise than pursuant to a Registration Statement hereunder, provided that any such Transfer complies with all applicable laws. SECTION 4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. In connection with any Registration Statement filed in accordance with the terms hereof, the following provisions shall apply: (a) The Issuer shall furnish to the Investment Advisor, prior to the filing thereof with the Commission, a copy of any Registration Statement, and each amendment thereof and each amendment or supplement, if any, to the Prospectus included therein shall use its best efforts to reflect in each such document, when so filed with the Commission, such comments as the Retirement Trust and the Investment Advisor, acting on behalf of the Pension Plans, may reasonably propose. The Investment Advisor and Retirement Trust, acting on behalf of the Pension Plans, agree to provide to the Issuer any information that the Issuer may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing of any such Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto. (b) The Issuer shall ensure that (i) any Registration Statement, and any amendment and any Prospectus forming part thereof, and any amendment or supplement thereto, complies in all material respects with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) any Prospectus forming part of any Registration Statement, and any amendment or supplement to such Prospectus, does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that no representation or agreement is made hereby with respect to information supplied in writing for inclusion in a Registration Statement or Prospectus by the Investment Advisor or the Retirement Trust. (c) The Issuer shall notify the Retirement Trust and the Pension Plans in writing: (i) when a Registration Statement and any amendment thereto has been filed with the Commission and when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective; 5
(ii) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to any Registration Statement or any Prospectus included therein or for additional information; (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (iv) of the receipt by the Issuer of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and (v) of the occurrence of any event that requires the making of any changes in any Registration Statement or Prospectus so that, as of such date, the statements therein are not misleading and do not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading (in which case the notice shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes have been made). (d) The Issuer shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement at the earliest possible time. (e) The Issuer shall furnish to the Investment Advisor and to the Underwriters, if any, named therein, such copies of any such Registration Statement, amendment or supplement thereto, and any Prospectus included therein (including each preliminary Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto), and such other documents as the Investment Advisor or such Underwriters (or their counsel) may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities. (f) Prior to any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to any Registration Statement, the Issuer shall use its best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Securities under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Investment Advisor or the Underwriters, if any, shall reasonably request (if such laws require the registration or qualification of such Registrable Securities to consummate the Transfer thereof) and to any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the Pension Plans to consummate the Transfer of the Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; provided, however, that the Issuer will not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general service of process or to taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject. 6
(g) The Issuer shall cooperate with the Investment Advisor and the Pension Plans to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be Transferred pursuant to any Registration Statement free of any restrictive legends and in such denominations and registered in such names as the Investment Advisor or the Underwriters, if any, may request. (h) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by paragraph (c) (v) above, the Issuer shall promptly prepare a post-effective amendment to any Registration Statement or an amendment or supplement to the related Prospectus or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable Securities included therein, the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (i) So long as the Common Stock is listed on any U.S. securities exchange, the Issuer shall use its best efforts to cause all of the Registrable Securities to be listed on such exchange. (j) The Issuer shall, if requested, promptly include in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement such information as the Investment Advisor and, if applicable, the Underwriters reasonably agree should be included therein, and shall make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after being notified of the matters to be included in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment. (k) The Issuer shall enter into such agreements (including underwriting agreements in customary form) and take all other appropriate actions in order to expedite or facilitate the registration or the Transfer of the Registrable Securities as the Investment Advisor or the Underwriters, if any, may reasonably request. (l) The Issuer shall (i) cause the Issuer's officers, directors, employees and independent accountants to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by the Investment Advisor or any such Underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with any such Registration Statement as is customary for similar due diligence examinations; provided, however, that any information that is provided by or on behalf of Issuer shall be kept confidential by the Investment Advisor, the Retirement Trust and the Pension Plans and any such Underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent, unless disclosure thereof is made in connection with a court proceeding or is required by law, or such information has become available to the public generally or through a third party without an accompanying obligation of confidentiality; (ii) make such representations and warranties to the Pension Plans, the Retirement Trust, the Investment Advisor and the Underwriters, if any, in form and substance as are customarily made by issuers to Underwriters; (iii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Issuer (which counsel may be an officer or employee of the Issuer) and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory) addressed to the Retirement Trust 7
on behalf of the Pension Plans, the Investment Advisor and the Underwriters, if any, covering such matters as are customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the Retirement Trust on behalf of the Pension Plans and such Underwriters; (iv) obtain "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent public accountants of the Issuer addressed to the Retirement Trust and the Pension Plans (provided the Pension Plans and the Trustee furnish the accountants with such representations as the accountants customarily require in similar situations), the Investment Advisor and the Underwriters, if any, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings; and (v) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Pension Plans, the Retirement Trust, the Investment Advisor and the Underwriters, if any, and with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the Issuer. The foregoing actions set forth in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) above shall be performed at the effectiveness of such Registration Statement and each post-effective amendment thereto and, if any, at each closing of an Underwritten Offering under any underwriting or similar agreement as and to the extent required thereunder. SECTION 5. REGISTRATION EXPENSES. The Issuer shall bear all expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and shall reimburse the Pension Plans and the Investment Advisor for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel (which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Issuer) designated by each of them to act as their respective legal counsel in connection with any Registration Statement hereunder. The Issuer shall have the right to select the financial printer to be used in connection with any registration of Registrable Securities hereunder. In no event shall Issuer have any obligation in respect of any fees or commissions to any broker, dealer, agent or other party or any underwriting discount, commission, fee or allowance incurred by the Retirement Trust on behalf of the Pension Plans or the Investment Advisor in connection with any Transfer of the Registrable Securities or any of them. SECTION 6. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. (a) (i) In connection with any Registration Statement, the Issuer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Pension Plans, the Retirement Trust and the Investment Advisor and each person who controls either of them within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration or in any preliminary Prospectus or Prospectuses, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, 8
liability or action; provided, however, that the Issuer will not be liable in any case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon (A) any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer by or on behalf of the Pension Plans or any other indemnified party specifically for inclusion therein, (B) use a Registration Statement or the related Prospectus during a period when a stop order has been issued in respect of such Registration Statement or any proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or use of a Prospectus when use of such Prospectus has been suspended pursuant to Section 3(d); provided, further, in each case, that the Pension Plans, the Retirement Trust or the Investment Advisor or such other indemnified party received prior notice of such stop order, initiation of proceedings or suspension or (C) if the Pension Plans, the Retirement Trust or the Investment Advisor fail to deliver a Prospectus or the then current Prospectus. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Issuer may otherwise have. (ii) The Issuer also agrees to indemnify any Underwriters of Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement, their officers and directors and each person who controls such Underwriters on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Pension Plans, the Retirement Trust and the Investment Advisor provided in this Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by the Retirement Trust on behalf of the Pension Plans and the Investment Advisor, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 4 hereof. (b) Each Underwriter (if any) shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the Investment Advisor, the Retirement Trust and the Pension Plans, and each of their directors, officers, employees and agents, and each person who controls the Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuer, but only with reference to written information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Issuer by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any such Underwriter may otherwise have. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent the indemnifying party did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and 9
expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel (and local counsel) if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party; provided further, that the indemnifying party shall not be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with appropriate local counsel) representing all the indemnified parties under paragraph (a)(i), paragraph (a)(ii) or paragraph (b) above. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), the aggregate contribution of the Retirement Trust and the Pension Plans 10
hereunder shall not exceed the gross proceeds received by the Pension Plans (including the Retirement Trust) from the Transfer of the Registrable Securities and no person quality of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls the Retirement Trust and/or the Pension Plans within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Pension Plans (including the Retirement Trust), and each person who controls the Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, and each of its directors, officers, employees and agents, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Issuer, subject in each case to the applicable terms and condition of this paragraph (d). (e) The provisions of this Section 6 will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party, and will survive the termination of this Agreement and the sale by the Retirement Trust on behalf of the Pension Plans of any Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement hereunder. SECTION 7. SELECTION OF UNDERWRITERS. Each of the Pension Plans (acting through the Retirement Trust) may sell, at its option, any Registrable Securities pursuant to an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the Underwriters that will participate in the offering will be selected by the Retirement Trust and the Investment Advisor; provided, however, that such Underwriters must be reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer. SECTION 8. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Issuer has not, as of the date hereof, entered into, any agreement that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Pension Plans herein or that otherwise conflict with the provisions hereof. (b) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless agreed to in a writing executed by the Issuer and the Pension Plans (acting through the Retirement Trust) and the Investment Advisor.

(h) No Third Party Beneficiaries.

(j) Cooperation.
