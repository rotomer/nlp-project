COM FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE #22630fi.203 GOODYEAR ELIMINATES DIVIDEND AKRON, Ohio, February 4, 2003 - The Board of Directors of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company today approved the elimination of the company's quarterly dividend. The dividend decision represents an expected annualized cash flow benefit of approximately $84 million, compared to the previous 12 cents per share dividend rate. "The elimination of the dividend is an important step in a series of actions the company is taking to improve its financial flexibility in light of recent disappointing results and challenging economic conditions," said Robert J. Keegan, president and chief executive officer. "This action follows recent actions that we have taken to improve our cost structure and strengthen our balance sheet." Goodyear is the world's largest tire company. The company manufactures tires, engineered rubber products and chemicals in more than 90 facilities in 28 countries. It has marketing operations in almost every country around the world. Goodyear employs about 92,000 people worldwide.
