     A copy of the news release issued by The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company on Wednesday, April 30, 2003, describing its results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1 GOODYEAR REPORTS RESULTS FOR 2003'S FIRST QUARTER - - SALES INCREASE 7.1 PERCENT FROM FIRST QUARTER, 2002 - - OPERATING RESULTS AND MARGINS IMPROVE IN SIX BUSINESSES AKRON, Ohio, April 30, 2003 - The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company today reported a net loss of $163.3 million (93 cents per share) for the first quarter of 2003, compared with a net loss of $63.2 million (39 cents per share) in the first quarter of 2002. All per share amounts are diluted. Six of the company's seven businesses continued to perform well during the quarter, posting year-over-year improvement in segment operating income and profit margin. However, these results were not enough to fully offset a loss in the company's North American Tire business, charges related to rationalization activities and an increased tax burden. First quarter total segment operating income was $68.0 million, more than double the $32.9 million achieved in the 2002 period. First quarter loss before income taxes was $135.0 million, compared to a loss of $85.6 million in the prior-year period. See the note at the end of this release for further explanation and a reconciliation table. "We remain very pleased with the strength of our international tire businesses, Engineered Products and our Chemicals units," said Robert J. Keegan, Goodyear president and chief executive officer. "Five of our businesses have recorded improved year-over-year segment operating income for four consecutive quarters. (more)
-2- "While North American Tire continues to struggle, we see room for optimism," Keegan said. "We are aggressively cutting costs to make this business competitive, and we are encouraged by market share gains in this unit compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. We have much work left to do, but our turnaround is on track." Results for the first quarter of 2003 include after-tax rationalization charges of $65.2 million (37 cents per share) as a result of retail and administrative consolidations in North America, Europe and Latin America. Goodyear reported sales of $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2003, up 7.1 percent from $3.3 billion during the prior-year period. Tire unit volume in the first quarter of 2003 was 52.6 million units, down from 53.0 million units in the 2002 period. Revenues in the first quarter increased compared to the 2002 period primarily due to the impact of currency translation, which the company estimates at $139 million, and price increases. Lower tire unit volume had a negative impact on sales. Interest expense decreased 5.2 percent to $57.8 million from $61.0 million in the first quarter of 2002 due primarily to lower interest rates. Depreciation and amortization expense was $147.9 million in the first quarter of 2003, versus $146.8 million in 2002. Capital expenditures were $90.1 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared with $75.8 million in 2002. BUSINESS SEGMENTS As previously stated, the company's total segment operating income more than doubled in the first quarter of 2003, compared to the prior-year period. North American Tire's unit volume was down 5.2 percent compared to the first quarter of 2002. Shipments to original equipment customers decreased 2.7 percent in the 2003 first quarter. Replacement volume fell 6.4 percent compared to the prior-year period. (more)
-3- Revenues for the 2003 first quarter decreased compared to last year due to industry weakness and reduced volume reflected in certain segments of the replacement market and units delivered in 2002 in connection with a Ford tire replacement program. Unfavorable mix also had a negative impact on sales compared to 2002. During the first quarter of 2002, Goodyear supplied approximately 500 thousand tires for the Ford tire replacement program, with a segment operating income benefit of approximately $10.0 million. Ford ended the replacement program on March 31, 2002. An operating loss was recorded for the quarter due to higher raw material costs, an unfavorable mix in the replacement market and lower volume. Segment operating income was favorably affected by cost reduction programs. Segment operating income in 2002 reflected a charge of $10.0 million principally related to the return of inventory to Goodyear following the April 6, 2002, closure of Penske Automotive Centers in the United States. European Union Tire's unit volume in the first quarter of 2003 was up 4.8 percent compared to 2002. Replacement volume increased 11.6 percent, while shipments to original equipment customers were down 7.7 percent. Sales increased in the first quarter primarily due to the favorable impact of currency translation, estimated at $171 million, as well as higher volume, price increases and improved product mix. Segment operating income increased 92.8 percent during the quarter, due primarily to lower production costs, the positive effect of currency translation and higher volume. (more)
-4- Eastern Europe, Africa and Middle East Tire's unit volume in the first quarter of 2003 was up 6.4 percent from 2002. Replacement volume increased 10.9 percent, while shipments to original equipment customers decreased 11.1 percent compared to the first quarter of 2002. Sales increased from 2002 due to improved pricing and the positive impact of currency translation. The company estimates that the currency movements favorably affected sales by about $35 million during the quarter. Segment operating income improved 94.4 percent in the quarter due to the impact of currency translation, lower production costs, improved price and mix, and higher volume. Latin American Tire's unit volume decreased 5.7 percent from the 2002 first quarter. Replacement volume was down 1.7 percent for the quarter. Shipments to original equipment customers were down 15.9 percent. Sales decreased in the first quarter as a result of currency translation. The company estimates currency movements had a $69 million negative impact on Latin America Tire sales in the quarter. Sales were favorably impacted by improved pricing and product mix. Segment operating income increased in the quarter due to improved pricing and product mix, but was negatively impacted by currency translation of approximately $27 million. Asia Tire's unit volume was up 8.9 percent from the 2002 first quarter. Replacement volume decreased 1.1 percent for the quarter and shipments to original equipment customers increased 35.3 percent, particularly in China. (more)
-5- Sales increased compared to 2002 due primarily to higher original equipment volume, as well as improved selling prices for replacement and original equipment tires. Segment operating income increased from 2002 due to improved pricing and product mix, the favorable impact of currency translation and higher volume. Engineered Products' sales in 2003's first quarter increased due largely to higher sales of replacement and military products. Segment operating income increased due to a customer's purchase of inventory previously held on consignment, higher volume, improved pricing and product mix. Chemical Products' sales increased for the quarter due to improved pricing related to higher raw material costs. Segment operating income increased significantly due to favorable pricing and volume.
