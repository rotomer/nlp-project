Item 5. Other Events
     On May 11, 2004, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (the "Company") issued a news release announcing, among other things: (i) that it would report fourth quarter 2003 financial results and details of its previously announced restatement of financial results on May 19, 2004; (ii) that the Company will not file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2004 by May 30, 2004, as required in its loan agreements and would initiate discussions with lenders to extend the deadline for filing the 10-Q by 30 days; (iii) that it was seeking an amendment from its European credit facility lenders to allow until June 4, 2004, for delivery to its lenders of the 2003 audited financial statements for its Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe BV joint venture, and that the Company must complete the financial statements or obtain this amendment by May 19, 2004 in order to file its 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K by that date and avoid defaults under its principal credit facilities. The news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 7. Exhibits
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1 MEDIA CONTACT: KEITH PRICE 330-796-1863 ANALYST CONTACT: BARB GOULD 330-796-8576 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOODYEAR TO REPORT 2003 FINANCIAL RESULTS ----------------------------------------- AKRON, Ohio, May 11, 2004 - The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company will report fourth quarter 2003 financial results and details of its previously announced restatement of financial results for the years 1999-2003 on Wednesday, May 19, followed by an investor conference call at 9 a.m. Prior to the call, the company will post the financial and other statistical information that will be presented on its investor relations Web site: investor.goodyear.com. Participating in the conference call will be Robert J. Keegan, chairman and chief executive officer, and Robert W. Tieken, executive vice president and chief financial officer. They will review Goodyear's fourth quarter results and the restatements as well as provide an outlook for the first quarter of 2004. As a result of the timing of Goodyear's filing of its 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the company said it expects the filing of its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2004 will be delayed until mid-June. Goodyear filed a Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission today in connection with this 10-Q. Because the company will not file the first quarter 2004 10-Q by May 30, as required in its loan agreements, Goodyear said it would initiate discussions with lenders to extend the deadline for filing by 30 days. While Goodyear does not expect to need to access the facilities during this 30-day period, in the absence of an extension, the company would not be able to access them. If Goodyear does not obtain an extension, it would still have until June 30 to file its 10-Q and regain access, but if Goodyear does not file its 10-Q by then, there could be an event of default under the loan agreements and thereafter under other debt instruments.

-2- Additionally, Goodyear said it is seeking an amendment from its European credit facility lenders to allow until June 4 for delivery to its lenders of the 2003 audited financial statements for its Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe BV joint venture. These financial statements, which have historically been completed after Goodyear's 10-K has been filed, are presently required to be delivered by May 19. Goodyear is seeking to complete these financial statements to coincide with the filing of its 10-K by May 19. Goodyear must complete these financial statements or obtain this amendment by May 19 in order to file the 10-K by that date and avoid defaults under its principal credit facilities. In today's 12b-25 filing, the company reported that it expects an improvement in results of operations for the first quarter of 2004 compared with the restated prior-year period and expects that segment operating income will be improved for each of its seven businesses. It also stated that until the financial statements are complete, the final results of operations for the first quarter results cannot be determined. Shareholders, members of the media and other interested persons may access the May 19 conference call on the Web site or via telephone by calling (706) 634-5954 before 8:55 a.m. that day. A taped replay of the conference call will be available at 2 p.m. by calling (706) 634-4556. The call replay will also remain available on the Web site. Goodyear is the world's largest tire company.
