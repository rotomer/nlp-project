Exhibit 99.1 MEDIA CONTACT: KEITH PRICE 330-796-1863 ANALYST CONTACT: BARB GOULD 330-796-8576 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOODYEAR PROVIDES FIRST QUARTER 2004 PREVIEW, FULL RESULTS DELAYED AKRON, Ohio, June 16, 2004 - The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company announced that it will not report full first quarter 2004 financial results today as previously scheduled, and the investor conference call planned for today will be rescheduled. As the financial community was expecting full results, the company is providing a summary of the key first quarter figures. The company expects to file its financial statements well within the June 30 deadline as required by its credit facilities. The delay is a result of the company's need for additional time to complete its financial statements for the first quarter. The company said it expects to report record first quarter sales of approximately $4.3 billion, compared to $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2003. Segment operating results are expected to improve significantly in six businesses, including North American Tire. The company's quarterly net loss is expected to be between $75 million and $85 million, which compares to a net loss of $196.5 million in the first quarter of 2003. The 2004 quarter will include rationalization charges of about $20 million and income tax of approximately $55 million. Goodyear is the world's largest tire company. The company manufactures tires, engineered rubber products and chemicals in more than 80 facilities in 28 countries around the world. Goodyear employs about 86,000 people worldwide.
