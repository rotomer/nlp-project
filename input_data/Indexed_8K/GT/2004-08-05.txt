EXHIBIT 99.1 MEDIA CONTACT: TRICIA INGRAHAM 330-796-8517 ANALYST CONTACT: BARB GOULD 330-796-8576 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOODYEAR EARNS PROFIT FOR 2004 SECOND QUARTER o REPORTS NET INCOME OF $25.1 MILLION, OR 14 CENTS PER SHARE o INCREASES SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME BY 92 PERCENT o DRIVES RECORD SALES OF $4.5 BILLION o ACHIEVES RECORD SECOND QUARTER SALES IN NORTH AMERICAN TIRE BUSINESS AKRON, Ohio, August 5, 2004 - With all seven businesses profitable, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company today reported net income of $25.1 million (14 cents per share) for the second quarter of 2004, reflecting record sales and increased unit volume. In the second quarter of 2003, the company had a net loss of $53.0 million (30 cents per share). All per share amounts are diluted. Sales of $4.5 billion were a record for any quarter, and a 20.1 percent increase from $3.8 billion during the 2003 period. The increase in sales reflects improved pricing and product mix as well as higher unit volume. It also reflects the positive impact of the consolidation of two subsidiaries and the favorable impact of currency translation. Tire unit volume in the second quarter of 2004 was 55.0 million units, compared to 52.8 million units in the 2003 period. All seven of Goodyear's business units reported higher segment operating income compared to the year-ago period. Total segment operating income was $285.8 million, up 91.7 percent from last year.

-2- "With a relentless focus on delivering sustained growth and profitability to our shareholders, we have been directing our attention toward controlling costs, enhancing dealer relationships, focusing on high-margin product lines and introducing new products designed to please customers around the world," said Robert J. Keegan, Goodyear chairman and chief executive officer. "This quarter's profitable results are a direct reflection of the ongoing efforts of our associates and demonstrate that we are on the right track," he said. "While we still have work to do, we are pleased by the success we have achieved to date, particularly the traction we are gaining in our North American Tire business, which is reporting a quarterly profit for the first time in nearly two years," Keegan added. "The company continues to work on improving both its operating results and capital structure, however we are confident that we are executing the right strategies. We expect our year-over-year momentum to continue through the second half." The second quarter of 2004 includes a $327 million positive impact on sales, a 1.3 million unit increase in tire volume and a $4.4 million impact on net income resulting from the consolidation of South Pacific Tyres Ltd. (SPT), a tire manufacturer in Australia and New Zealand, and T&WA, a tire-mounting operation in the United States. These operations were consolidated in accordance with U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46). The 2004 second quarter also included after-tax rationalization charges of $8.6 million (5 cents per share) and an after-tax charge of $9.0 million (5 cents per share) related to external professional fees associated with the previously disclosed accounting investigation. The quarter also included an after-tax gain of $1.7 million (1 cent per share) on asset sales. The company estimates the effects of currency translation had a positive impact on second quarter sales of approximately $86 million. Raw material cost increases of approximately $41 million offset the savings generated from rationalization actions and improved productivity. The second quarter of 2003 included an after-tax rationalization charge of $11.5 million (6 cents per share) and an after-tax loss of $6.2 million (3 cents per share) on asset sales. (more)
-3- Goodyear recently announced additional plans to refinance and lengthen the maturity of one of its U.S. credit facilities and the company will continue to use specific strategies to address high levels of debt and unfunded pension obligations. In addition to further refinancing to lengthen debt maturities, Goodyear will explore potential asset sales and will ultimately seek increased equity funding to improve its credit profile. YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS Sales for the first six months of 2004 were a record $8.8 billion, an increase of 20.6 percent from $7.3 billion in the 2003 period. Tire unit volume was 110.7 million units, up from 105.4 million units a year ago. The net loss for the first six months of 2004 was $51.8 million (30 cents per share), compared to a loss of $249.5 million ($1.42 per share) during the year-ago period. The consolidation of SPT and T&WA increased tire unit volume by 3.1 million units, had a positive impact on sales of $581 million, and had a minimal impact on the net loss. The first six months of 2004 included the following after-tax items: a rationalization charge of $29.1 million (16 cents per share); a charge of $24.3 million (14 cents per share) related to external professional fees associated with the previously disclosed accounting investigation; an expense of $11.6 million (7 cents per share) relating primarily to a fire at a European tire manufacturing facility, and $4.9 million (3 cents per share) for accelerated depreciation primarily related to the closure of a Latin American tire manufacturing facility. The half also included an after-tax gain on sale of assets of $5.6 million (3 cents per share). The 2003 year-to-date period included an after-tax rationalization charge of $69.2 million (39 cents per share) and an after-tax loss on asset sales of $5.1 million (3 cents per share). The company estimates the effects of currency movements had a positive impact on sales of approximately $286 million during the first half. BUSINESS SEGMENTS Second quarter total segment operating income was $285.8 million, an increase of 91.7 percent compared to $149.1 million in the 2003 period. For the first half, total segment operating income was $501.9 million, an increase of 162.6 percent from $191.1 million in 2003. (more)
-4- See the note at the end of this release for further explanation and a reconciliation table. North American Tire's unit volume increased 1.6 percent in the second quarter of 2004, and 0.7 percent in the first six months. Replacement volume increased 5.6 percent in the quarter and 2.4 percent in the six-month period, while shipments to original equipment customers were down 5.9 percent in the quarter and 2.7 percent in the first half compared to the 2003 periods. Sales were a second quarter record, increasing 17.1 percent compared to the 2003 period, and 14 percent for the first six months. Sales were positively affected by the consolidation of T&WA; favorable pricing and product mix, primarily in the replacement markets; as well as increased volume. Second quarter results were driven by sustained improvement in Goodyear-brand tires, as well as some stabilization in the company's private label business. Second quarter segment operating income improved significantly compared to the 2003 period due to improved pricing and product mix, as well as higher volume in the consumer replacement and commercial original equipment markets. Savings from rationalization programs partially offset higher raw material and manufacturing costs. Segment operating income for the first half improved 98.3 percent from 2003. Pricing and product mix, as well as volume improvements, were driven primarily by the consumer replacement and commercial original equipment tire markets, consistent with second-quarter drivers. Higher raw material costs, as well as higher manufacturing costs, were partially offset by rationalization savings. The consolidation of T&WA increased sales by approximately $152 million in the second quarter and $226 million in the first half. T&WA's results included in segment operating income were approximately $1.0 million for both the quarter and the half. (more)
-5- European Union Tire's unit volume in the second quarter of 2004 increased 3.2 percent from 2003, and 3.1 percent for the first half. Replacement volume increased 4.1 percent for the quarter and 5 percent for the first six months. Shipments to original equipment customers were essentially flat in the second quarter and the first half. Sales increased 10.4 percent for a new second quarter record, and increased 14.9 percent for the six months compared to 2003 due primarily to the favorable effect of currency translation and higher volume. Improved pricing and product mix also drove the sales increase in the 2004 first half. The company estimates the effects of currency translation positively impacted sales by approximately $65 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $195 million in the first half. Segment operating income increased 50.5 percent during the second quarter and doubled for the first six months of 2004 primarily due to improved pricing and product mix, higher volume and the favorable impact of currency translation. The first half also benefited from productivity and cost reduction improvements. Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa Tire's unit volume in the second quarter of 2004 decreased 2.9 percent from the 2003 period, and increased 5.8 percent for the first half. Replacement volume was down 2.8 percent for the quarter, but up 5.5 percent for the half. Shipments to original equipment customers were down 3.5 percent compared to the second quarter of 2003, but up 6.9 percent for the half. (more)
-6- Sales were up 12 percent in the quarter and 17.7 percent in the half primarily due to improved pricing and product mix, largely the result of increased sales of high performance and commercial truck tires, the impact of price increases and the favorable impact of currency translation. The company estimates currency translations had a positive impact on sales of approximately $20 million in the second quarter, and $48 million in the first half. Segment operating income improved 33.1 percent in the quarter and 59.9 percent for the half due to improved pricing and product mix, as well as higher volume. Latin American Tire's unit volume increased 5.3 percent from the 2003 second quarter and 6.1 percent for the first half. Replacement volume was up 10.2 percent for the quarter and 11 percent for the half. Shipments to original equipment customers were down 9.2 percent for the quarter and 8.4 percent for the first six months. Sales were favorably impacted in both periods by price increases and improved product mix, primarily in the replacement market, as well as higher volume. In the second quarter, these factors were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation of approximately $8 million in the quarter. The effects of currency translation had a positive impact on first half sales of approximately $9 million. Segment operating income increased significantly in both periods of 2004 due to improved pricing, product mix and volume, as well as savings from cost reduction programs. (more)
-7- Asia/Pacific Tire's unit volume was up 36.9 percent from the 2003 second quarter, and 44.3 percent for the first half of the year, driven largely by the consolidation of SPT. Replacement volume increased 45.6 percent for the quarter and 59.4 percent for the half. Shipments to original equipment customers increased 18.8 percent for the quarter, and 13.9 percent for the first six months. Sales increased compared to the 2003 periods due primarily to the consolidation of SPT. Improved pricing and product mix also had a positive impact on sales during the quarter and half. The favorable impact of currency translation on first-half sales was approximately $9 million. Segment operating income increased for both the quarter and the half compared to 2003 due to improved pricing and product mix, as well as lower manufacturing costs due to improved productivity. The consolidation of SPT had a slightly favorable impact on the quarter. The consolidation of SPT increased units by 1.3 million in the second quarter and 3.1 million in the first half, and increased sales by approximately $173 million in the quarter and $353 million in the half. The impact on segment operating income was an approximately $1.0 million increase in the second quarter, with a minimal decrease in the first half. Engineered Products' sales in the second quarter of 2004 increased 23.1 percent due largely to higher volume and favorable product mix related to military, original equipment and replacement sales. Strong military, industrial and original equipment sales drove the 20.6 percent increase in sales during the first half. Currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately $5 million in the quarter and $22 million in the first half. Segment operating income increased in both periods due to higher volume, primarily in the military business. Savings from rationalization actions also improved segment operating income in the second quarter. (more)
-8- Chemical Products' sales increased in both the quarter and the half due to higher volume and higher selling prices resulting primarily from the pass through of increased raw material and energy costs. Segment operating income increased significantly in both periods due to improved price and mix, higher volume and plant efficiencies. The company announced last month that it has concluded its exploration into the possible sale of the Chemicals Business, determining that the business remains more valuable to Goodyear and its stakeholders if retained than if sold.
