Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On September 3, 2004, the Chief Executive Officer of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company ("Goodyear") approved rationalization plans for each of the Chemical and Engineered Products business segments under which a total of approximately $29 million to $33.5 million of charges are expected to be incurred in the third quarter of 2004. Also in the third quarter of 2004, Goodyear expects to reverse approximately $4 million to $8 million of reserves related to previous Engineered Products rationalization plans. Under the Chemical rationalization plan, approximately 100 associates related to production, sales and R&D activities, will be released as the Chemical business segment implements cost reduction strategies. Goodyear expects to incur charges of approximately $5.5 million to $6 million in the third quarter of 2004 for personnel termination and pension costs related to the plan. The plan is expected to be substantially complete in the fourth quarter of 2004 and is expected to result in future cash expenditures of approximately $2 million to $2.5 million. Under the Engineered Products rationalization plan, Engineered Products is expanding certain existing rationalization activities and is implementing additional rationalization activities. The expanded activities relate to the ongoing closure of a warehouse in Lincoln, Nebraska and the continued realignment of the sales function with the centralization of marketing roles in Akron. In addition, Engineered Products will be consolidating production in more cost-effective locations. Engineered Products plans an additional reduction of approximately 240 associates under the plan. Goodyear expects to incur charges of approximately $23.5 million to $27.5 million in the third quarter of 2004 as a result of these actions of which approximately $22.5 million to $26.5 million is related to personnel reductions, pension and retiree benefit costs and approximately $1 million is related to other costs. Additionally, Engineered Products expects to incu r charges of approximately $2.5 million to $4 million in future periods related to moving expenses associated with these plans. The actions are expected to be complete by the end of the third quarter of 2005 and are expected to result in future cash expenditures of approximately $4.5 million to $6.5 million. The charges incurred under the Engineered Products plan will be offset by the reversal of approximately $4 million to $8 million of reserves from previous rationalization actions no longer needed for their originally intended purposes.
