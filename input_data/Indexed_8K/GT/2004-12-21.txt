Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On December 14, 2004, Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V., a subsidiary of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company ("Goodyear") organized in the Netherlands, and certain of its subsidiaries announced that they had entered into definitive agreements, dated December 10, 2004, for a new five-year pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility. On December 21, 2004, the facility, which will be reflected as a long-term debt obligation on Goodyears consolidated financial statements, was funded with approximately 165 million. The new facility has the ability to be expanded to 275 million, and will be subject to customary annual renewal of back-up liquidity lines. The new facility replaces an 82.5 million facility in the companys French operating unit which was paid off in connection with the funding of the new facility. For additional information concerning the new facility, please refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Goodyear on December 15, 2004.
