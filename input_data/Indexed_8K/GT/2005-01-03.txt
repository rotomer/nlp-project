Item 8.01. Other Events.
The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company ("Goodyear") has reached agreement effective December 28, 2004, with certain insurance companies to settle Goodyears claims for insurance coverage for environmental property damage and, in certain instances, environmental bodily injury, involved in an action previously filed by Goodyear in Summit County, Ohio. While many of the specific terms of the settlement are confidential, it generally provides for the payment to Goodyear, in installments over 15 months, of approximately $159 million, in exchange for the release by Goodyear of past, present, and future environmental property damage claims against the settling insurers under their policies. In addition, the settlement provides (1) in certain instances, for the resolution of insurance claims by Goodyear for future costs related to environmental bodily injury, and (2) for Goodyears indemnification of the settling insurers against certain claims by other parties.
