Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
On February 22, 2005, Bober, Markey, Fedorovich & Company ("Bober") was appointed as the independent auditor for The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Employee Savings Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees (the "Plan") for the year ended December 31, 2004, replacing PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"). This action dismisses PwC as the Plans independent auditors for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decision to change auditors was approved by the audit committee of the Board of Directors of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (the "Company") on February 22, 2005. The audit reports of PwC on the financial statements of the Plan for the past two fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the two most recent fiscal years and through February 22, 2005, there were no disagreements between the Plan and PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report on the Plans financial statements. During the two most recent fiscal years and through February 22, 2005, there were no "reportable events" with respect to the Plan as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation SK. During the two most recent fiscal years and through February 22, 2005, the Company did not consult with Bober with respect to the Plan regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation SK. The Plan provided a copy of the foregoing disclosures to PwC prior to the date of the filing of this report and requested that PwC furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the statements in this Item 4.0 1. A copy of the letter furnished in response to that request is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8K.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(c) Exhibits. 16.1 Letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, dated February 25, 2005, regarding change in certifying accountant of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company Employee Savings Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees.
