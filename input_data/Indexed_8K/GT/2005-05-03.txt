Item 8.01                     Other Events.
     As previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 (the "2004 Form 10-K"), effective January 1, 2005, we integrated our Chemical Products business segment into our North American Tire business segment. Attached as Exhibit 99 is supplemental financial information reflecting this integration on a pro-forma basis for the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002 as previously set forth in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2004 Form 10-K.
     The integration will impact the reporting of total segment sales and total segment operating income. For example, during 2004, $818.6 million, or 53.4%, of Chemical Products' sales and 75.2% of its segment operating income resulted from intercompany transactions. Beginning with the first quarter of 2005, our total segment sales will no longer reflect these intercompany sales. In addition, the segment operating income previously attributable to Chemical Products' intercompany transactions will no longer be included in the total segment operating income that we report.
